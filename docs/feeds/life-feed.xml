        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs another &lt;em&gt;Blog Questions Challenge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://beep.town/@blog_challenge/114162794720726554&quot;&gt;This week&lt;/a&gt;, it‚Äôs all about &lt;strong&gt;Travel Adventures&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the questions‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#silliest-souvenir&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs the silliest souvenir you‚Äôve ever brought back from a trip?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#teleport-for-a-day-trip&quot;&gt;If you could teleport anywhere right now, for a day trip, where would you go?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#weirdest-food&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs the weirdest food you‚Äôve ever tried while traveling?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#memorable-wrong-turn&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs the most memorable ‚Äúwrong turn‚Äù you‚Äôve taken on an adventure?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;silliest-souvenir&quot;&gt;Silliest Souvenir&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014 me and my wife went to Costa Rica. We did a lot of travel-by-bus to various excusions and destinations across the country. During those bus rides, I (&lt;em&gt;for whatever reason&lt;/em&gt;) witnessed an unusual amount of machete-based chopping of vegetation and general plant-related growth on the sides of the rural roads we traveled down. Now this might not be unusual for Costa Rica, but it was for me as a tourist. So &lt;em&gt;naturally&lt;/em&gt;, I wanted to get a &lt;strong&gt;machete&lt;/strong&gt; as a souvenir. At the time of purchasing it, I never considered what it would look like, trying to get a huge machete back through customs at the airport‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State-side, we got to security and that‚Äôs when I remembered my cargo. &lt;em&gt;Sure enough&lt;/em&gt;, going through security I was asked to come with them to a back room as they had some questions for me. I thought for sure it was because of the machete. But &lt;em&gt;nope&lt;/em&gt;! They were interested in a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; souvenir of mine. We had also purchased a ‚Äúrain stick‚Äù, which is effectively just a hollow wooden tube filled with small beads. They were really curious (and slightly concerend) about what all those little beads were inside the stick. After a brief explanation though they were satisfied and I was on my way once more. Not even a single mention of the machete. &lt;em&gt;Hah!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;teleport-for-a-day-trip&quot;&gt;Teleport for a Day Trip&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2025/otemanu.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Mt. Otemanu&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs me in Bora Bora circa 2016. There‚Äôs a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; non-zero chance that I was thinking about climbing that mountain in this exact moment (&lt;em&gt;in addition to just posing for a super-cool sunset pic&lt;/em&gt;). If I could teleport to one place for a day to do something, it wound be here, to &lt;strong&gt;hike Bora Bora‚Äôs Mount Otemanu&lt;/strong&gt;. Afterwards, I‚Äôd just chill on the beach with a nice beverage and watch the sun set, much like I did in 2016. üèùÔ∏è üåÖ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;weirdest-food&quot;&gt;Weirdest Food&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, I went on my first international trip ever. So where does one go on their first trip out of the country? &lt;em&gt;Africa of course&lt;/em&gt;! Me and my wife went to South Africa‚Äîfirst to Cape Town and then to Kruger National Park for some safari-ing. To this day (&lt;em&gt;and I‚Äôve done a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/about?about=travel&quot;&gt;fair bit of travel since&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), I would still say it‚Äôs my favorite trip I‚Äôve ever done. One night, while dining out in the city-center of Cape Town, we ordered what I remember as some sort of ‚Äúexotic meat sampler‚Äù. On the resulting plate, we tried a number of interesting South African-native game including Kudu, Crocodile, Springbok and if I‚Äôm remembering fully, Zebra. All I really remember about that experience beyond what I tried was that Kudu was delicious, and I was &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; into the croc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;memorable-wrong-turn&quot;&gt;Memorable Wrong Turn&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look&lt;/em&gt;, my wife is the (trip) planner of the two of us, and she is &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; at it. What this means is that our trips are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; fantastic, we get into a TON of fun activities, and we &lt;em&gt;rarely&lt;/em&gt; encounter anything you might consider a ‚Äúwrong turn‚Äù. That said, this particlar question made me think of two distinct wrong-turn-esque events‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once, while driving &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; in Germany we witnessed this little car in front of us try to make too sharp of a turn on a highway on-ramp and completely spin out‚Äîlike a 360¬∞ spin. It was wild, and quite scary to witness. A ‚Äúwrong turn‚Äù for that individual to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most memorable ‚Äúwrong turn‚Äù for me however occurred when me and my wife were trying to drive back from the national park in Sintra, Portugal to where we were staying in Lisbon. We exited the park into what I imagine was the old-town part of Sintra and ended up on some very tiny streets with extremely narrow passage ways between the buildings and walls of the town. At one point, my wife had to get out of the car and help me narrowly traverse one particularly tight corridor. Our rental was a pretty small car too. Luckily, we made it out without a scratch, &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Career mistakes I&apos;ve made</title>
        <shark:summary><p><u>A lot</u>. Let‚Äôs talk about ‚Äòem‚Ä¶</p>
</shark:summary>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;A lot&lt;/u&gt;. Let‚Äôs talk about ‚Äòem‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not asking questions&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Never&lt;/em&gt; be afraid to ask questions. It doesn‚Äôt matter what anyone else thinks, and most of the time, they aren‚Äôt going to think what you are worried they might think about you asking a question. It‚Äôs an opportunity to learn something and each time you don‚Äôt ask the question, you miss out on that opportunity. Don‚Äôt let imposter syndrome get to you, don‚Äôt let some expectation of what you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed to know‚Äù stop you, don‚Äôt be shy. &lt;em&gt;Just do it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don‚Äôt discount the small things&lt;/strong&gt;. There‚Äôs a lot you may learn (or be forced to learn) that you think is ‚Äúunimportant‚Äù or ‚Äúuninteresting‚Äù but in my experience, those things have a way of coming back and being of importance later. The amount of times I‚Äôve had to relearn things is absolutely infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take breaks, but don‚Äôt let off the gas&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Look&lt;/em&gt;, you don‚Äôt want to be burned out, but you don‚Äôt want to lose your motivation, your drive, your momentum either. I wonder sometimes where I could be if I had remained focused and really kept my eye on certain goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a portfolio&lt;/strong&gt;. I have a portfolio / personal website (combined) that I‚Äôve been maintaining &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/05/30/5-years&quot;&gt;since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. I graduated &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/training-retrospective#my-education-journey&quot;&gt;college&lt;/a&gt; and joined the workforce full time in 2010-&lt;em&gt;ish&lt;/em&gt;. In those 9 years I wish I had that same idea to document my journey, blog about what I‚Äôd learned and built a reference for myself over the course of my entire career. It would have been game changing I think.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the journey, not the destination(s)&lt;/strong&gt;. Clich√© maybe, but the wisdom is there I think. I spent too much time trying to get to X job, or Y &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/11/14/stop-worrying-about-certification-paths&quot;&gt;certification&lt;/a&gt;, or Z salary and less time focused on building a skillset brick by brick which would have given me the foundation required to really make it farther.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take risks&lt;/strong&gt;, especially earlier in your career. I‚Äôm mostly satisfied with my early career moves. But I think I‚Äôve missed some opportunities. Hindsight is always 20/20 (as they say) but there are a few things I think I regret.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network&lt;/strong&gt;. Yea, by this I mean traditional networking across your industry, but more specifically, I mean at your company. Spend the time to cultivate relationships - with your team, with your manager, with your skip, with other ‚Äúmovers-and-shakers‚Äù. Find ways to be impactful for them. I‚Äôve always been terrible at ‚Äúplaying the game‚Äù, so it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù I own to some degree, but I advise others to try a slightly more determined approach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being a generalist is fine, but &lt;strong&gt;go deep on SOMETHING&lt;/strong&gt;, maybe a few things. I wish I had spent more time just diving super deep into one specific domain, rather than getting distracted by every little thing across my entire field. Sure, I‚Äôm a perfectly good generalist and have some specialties, but I‚Äôm not &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; specialized in anything specific I don‚Äôt think.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more things, but I‚Äôm tapped out. Don‚Äôt make all these mistakes! I got time to fix ‚Äòem though üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This Post is Me Procrastinating</title>
        <shark:summary><p>I am <strong>procrastinating</strong>. <em>Like</em>, right now I‚Äôm doing it. I‚Äôve got a <em>ton</em> of other more important things to work on - at home, at my job, even for my site.

Because you see, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm sittin‚Äô around doin‚Äô <u>nothing</u>. I‚Äôm creating! I‚Äôm working on my site. Yeah, I‚Äôm procrastinating, <em>sure</em>. But what comes out of it all is something I‚Äôm proud of. So it‚Äôs completely justified right? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre nodding your head right now in agreement, and I appreciate that.</p>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;strong&gt;procrastinating&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Like&lt;/em&gt;, right now I‚Äôm doing it. I‚Äôve got a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of other more important things to work on - at home, at my job, even for my site. I gotta do taxes for example, *&lt;em&gt;blegh&lt;/em&gt;*! &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt;, I kinda don‚Äôt have the energy, or don‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;feel like it&lt;/em&gt;, or just saw something else shiny to work on instead (e.g. this post).

But what comes out of it all is something I‚Äôm proud of. So it‚Äôs completely justified right? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre nodding your head right now in agreement, and I appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;ph ph-music-note-simple&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hum-dee-dum-dee-dooooo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;ph ph-music-note-simple&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* &lt;em&gt;spins around in swivelly chair&lt;/em&gt; *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else can I yap about here instead of just publishing this and moving on to my &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; to-do list? &lt;em&gt;Hrmmm&lt;/em&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I‚Äôm kinda hungry&lt;/em&gt;. Let me do a web search for ‚Äúeating procrastinating‚Äù. &lt;em&gt;Oh look at that&lt;/em&gt;! I just learned about the term ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.today.com/health/procrastineating-how-fix-snack-habit-thats-hurting-you-1d80331013&quot;&gt;procrastineating&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù. This is &lt;u&gt;perfect&lt;/u&gt; for me right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* &lt;em&gt;stomach audibly grumbles&lt;/em&gt; *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OK, I‚Äôma go&lt;/em&gt; - make myself a li‚Äôl snacky-snack. When I get back down to my office I‚Äôm &lt;u&gt;totally&lt;/u&gt; goin‚Äô to get right into the stuff I need to do. üòâ&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Guiding Principles</title>
        <shark:summary><p>Inspired by <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2025/01/21/guiding-principles-for-my-website/">Tracy</a> and <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2025/03/05/philosophy-of-james-coffee-blog">James</a>, I‚Äôve wanted to document the <strong>guiding principles</strong> by which I approach how I work on and write for <span class="shellsharks">shellsharks</span>.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://tracydurnell.com/2025/01/21/guiding-principles-for-my-website/&quot;&gt;Tracy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesg.blog/2025/03/05/philosophy-of-james-coffee-blog&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;, I‚Äôve wanted to document the &lt;strong&gt;guiding principles&lt;/strong&gt; by which I approach how I work on and write for &lt;span class=&quot;shellsharks&quot;&gt;shellsharks&lt;/span&gt;. Naturally too, I am taking this opportunity to bring this forth via a &lt;a href=&quot;https://slashpages.net/#why&quot;&gt;/why ‚Äúslash page‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;. These tenets are not always concious decisions in everything I do, but they are unmistakably part of the foundation of this site, and of myself as a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My site is meant to be &lt;strong&gt;fun&lt;/strong&gt; - for me, and for whoever comes here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So I purposefully imbue this site with an unapologetic &lt;strong&gt;whimsy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs a place to be &lt;strong&gt;uniquely me&lt;/strong&gt; - my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/style&quot;&gt;aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;, my writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/writing-mannerisms&quot;&gt;style&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/devlog/build-then-smile#the-artwork&quot;&gt;art&lt;/a&gt;, my topics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don‚Äôt box myself in &lt;strong&gt;creatively&lt;/strong&gt;. I am free to write across all genres. It‚Äôs been &lt;u&gt;Infosec&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;Technology&lt;/u&gt;, and &lt;u&gt;Life&lt;/u&gt;-in-general from the beginning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is a place for me to &lt;strong&gt;learn&lt;/strong&gt;, to &lt;strong&gt;teach&lt;/strong&gt;, to ‚Äúpay it forward‚Äù.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I write with a &lt;strong&gt;beginners mindset&lt;/strong&gt;. I want what I write to be a &lt;strong&gt;reference for myself&lt;/strong&gt; and available to be consumed by all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every page is a living document, I always reserve the right to &lt;strong&gt;change my mind&lt;/strong&gt;, or add new content.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is a way for me to &lt;strong&gt;connect&lt;/strong&gt; - to be a part of, and build &lt;strong&gt;community&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shellsharks is a central, canonical point of presence for myself on the web. &lt;b&gt;I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;shellsharks&quot;&gt;shellsharks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy writing, it‚Äôs why I have this blog. But my style is &lt;em&gt;far from perfect&lt;/em&gt; in the technical sense. I‚Äôm &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; aware of the many interesting and possibly unique writing quirks and habits I have. &lt;em&gt;So&lt;/em&gt;, here I reflect on and catalog those distinct &lt;strong&gt;writing mannerisms&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think my most prevalent (bad) habit is &lt;strong&gt;run-on sentences&lt;/strong&gt;, they are everywhere! I consider my style of writing to be very &lt;em&gt;conversational&lt;/em&gt; in its cadence, and in this way it tends to mirror my speech in many respects, and I‚Äôve been known to be a bit of a &lt;em&gt;looooong&lt;/em&gt;-talker.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alright&lt;/em&gt;, I‚Äôve mentioned that my writing is very &lt;em&gt;conversational&lt;/em&gt;. In this vein, I use a lot of &lt;strong&gt;linguistic affects&lt;/strong&gt; like ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù, ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù, ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;alright&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù, ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù, etc‚Ä¶ I tend to use these at the beginning of sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like to use &lt;strong&gt;hyphens&lt;/strong&gt; (‚Äú &lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äú) to bridge two sentences together - joining separate, but related ideas or thoughts together in a way that a standard period doesn‚Äôt seem suited for and where a comma just wouldn‚Äôt supply the correct tempo to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; use a lot of &lt;strong&gt;font styles&lt;/strong&gt;, e.g. &lt;em&gt;italicizing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;u&gt;underlining&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;bolding&lt;/strong&gt;. I‚Äôd describe my methodology for employing these styles as very &lt;u&gt;vibes-based&lt;/u&gt;, with no real strict convention. This said, &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt; are generally reserved as a way for me to emphasize words as I would do if I was actually &lt;em&gt;speaking&lt;/em&gt; them in conversation. &lt;strong&gt;Bolded&lt;/strong&gt; terms are meant to &lt;strong&gt;highlight&lt;/strong&gt; the main point or topic of a paragraph / section. More recently, I‚Äôve also started &lt;u&gt;underlining&lt;/u&gt; things and don‚Äôt really have a specific usecase for when I typically deploy it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/hyperlink-travel&quot;&gt;love links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I spend &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/blogging-methodology#editing--enrichment&quot;&gt;a lot of time&lt;/a&gt; linking out to things locally within a page (to a section anchor for example), internally to my site as well as externally across the web. These links are typically &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt;, rather than explicit URLs or list(s) of references.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My life is very list-driven, the way I think is often very list-based, and so it follows that my writing features &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;lists&lt;/strong&gt;. This blog post is &lt;em&gt;essentially&lt;/em&gt; one big list!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do a lot of &lt;strong&gt;parenthetical asides&lt;/strong&gt;. For whatever reason, I very-frequently (&lt;em&gt;and am literally going to do it right here&lt;/em&gt;) inject my own commentary and bonus context smack-dab in the middle of my sentences. When doing so, I tend to italicize the aside ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one really bugs me - I have the annoying habit of using ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;it‚Äôs&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù when I just need to say ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;its&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù. This site has seen it since it‚Äôs inception‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm too often unsure of whether I should use the word ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;their&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù or ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;there&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù. (But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; on when to use ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;they‚Äôre&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù üòÑ). There‚Äôs (‚¨ÖÔ∏è &lt;em&gt;this one right?&lt;/em&gt;) gotta be a way to easily remember which to use‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use a lot of &lt;strong&gt;e.g.&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äôs and &lt;strong&gt;i.e.&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äôs (&lt;em&gt;I‚Äôm sure incorrectly in many cases&lt;/em&gt;) and though I‚Äôve looked up their meanings many-a-time (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grammarly.com/blog/acronyms-abbreviations/i-e-vs-e-g/&quot;&gt;literally as I write this&lt;/a&gt;) I always seem to forget the distinction shortly after (i.e. I often can‚Äôt remember even after &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; reading the definitions of the two terms). &lt;em&gt;So&lt;/em&gt;, for current and future me, &lt;strong&gt;e.g.&lt;/strong&gt; stands for ‚Äúexempli gratia‚Äù &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äúfor example‚Äù and &lt;strong&gt;i.e.&lt;/strong&gt; stands for ‚Äúid est‚Äù which means ‚Äúin other words‚Äù. &lt;em&gt;SMUSH IT INTO YOUR BRAIN~!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HTML supports &lt;em&gt;6&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements&quot;&gt;Section Heading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; elements, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;h6&lt;/code&gt;. I‚Äôm somewhat inconsistent in how I deploy them in my posts, it‚Äôs all very &lt;em&gt;vibes-ey&lt;/em&gt;. I‚Äôd say most of the time I stick with a standard &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; for main sections across the site, but sometimes I‚Äôll just start with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt; instead, with no &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; as a parent section at all. Best I can explain is that sometimes I feel a post might not ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù a section capitalized by the largest header? I suspect this particular quirk is often seen across my short-form &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notebook&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm super inconsistent about grammatically sticking to &lt;strong&gt;first-person&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;second-person&lt;/strong&gt;. You‚Äôll notice this quite often I‚Äôm sure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than just ending a paragraph or section gracefully with a period, I‚Äôll often just end it with a nice set of &lt;strong&gt;ellipsis&lt;/strong&gt;. Usually this denotes that the next section, paragraph, list, image, or whatever is directly related to what I was &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; talking about. Like with many of my writing peculiarties, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not being used correctly‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though I think I‚Äôve started to improve on this, my blog posts (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/multiplicity-of-writing&quot;&gt;other content&lt;/a&gt;) has never employed a large amount of &lt;strong&gt;pictures&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;graphics&lt;/strong&gt;. The reason for this is simple - there‚Äôs quite a bit of overhead to add images to posts within my static site generator &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/blogging-from-ipad#workflow&quot;&gt;workflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mirrorin‚Äô my own in-speech linguistic tendencies once more, I do a lot of ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;G-dropping&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù, i.e. when a the ‚Äòg‚Äô is dropped in words that end in ‚Äò-ing‚Äô. So in other words, I do a lot of &lt;em&gt;G-droppin‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;. (You‚Äôll notice here that I almost always add that li‚Äôl apostrophe when I do a &lt;em&gt;G-drop&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emojis&lt;/strong&gt;. Another &lt;em&gt;more recent&lt;/em&gt; addition to my writing flare, I like to add a bit of evocation to my prose üòé.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text walls&lt;/strong&gt; / monolithic paragraphs are a staple of &lt;span class=&quot;shellsharks&quot;&gt;shellsharks.com&lt;/span&gt;. Honestly, I‚Äôll admit that I really don‚Äôt know when to break paragraphs up sometimes. I apologize to your eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll repeat, I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; writing and really enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2025/01/28/tinkering-with-the-site-again&quot;&gt;tinkering&lt;/a&gt; around on this site. I‚Äôm passionate about this stuff, so I tend to get real excited and do a lot of &lt;strong&gt;exclamation points&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In reading this, or any of my other posts, would you say the tone is ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;conversational&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù? I try to use a lot of &lt;strong&gt;questions&lt;/strong&gt; like these in my writing to help make it so.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs it for now! A lot of these call-outs are &lt;em&gt;stylistic&lt;/em&gt; choices, while others are admittedly just bad habits or writing deficiencies that over time I‚Äôd like to eradicate. Thanks for sticking with me through all of ‚Äòem!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://beep.town/@blog_challenge&quot;&gt;Blog Questions Challenge Bot&lt;/a&gt;‚Äôs challenge about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://beep.town/@blog_challenge/114099263407801474&quot;&gt;Movies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which asks these &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; questions‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#whats-a-movie-you-can-practically-quote-from-start-to-finish&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs a movie you can practically quote from start to finish?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#if-you-could-live-in-any-movie-universe-which-would-you-choose&quot;&gt;If you could live in any movie universe, which would you choose?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#whats-the-most-ridiculous-movie-plot-youve-ever-seen&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs the most ridiculous movie plot you‚Äôve ever seen?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#what-movie-snack-is-an-absolute-must-have-for-you&quot;&gt;What movie snack is an absolute must-have for you?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;fin&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-a-movie-you-can-practically-quote-from-start-to-finish&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs a movie you can practically quote from start to finish?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gladiator&lt;/strong&gt;. I‚Äôve seen this movie countless times, and have been watching it nigh continuously for decades. Look, it‚Äôs my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/05/05/favorite-movies&quot;&gt;favorite movie&lt;/a&gt;, so yeah I might be biased, but Gladiator has an endless pool of quotable scenes, it‚Äôs just crazy‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the TRUE emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hold the line! Stay with me! If you find yourself alone, riding in the green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled. For you are in Elysium, and you‚Äôre already dead! &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2022/11/17/gladiator&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;ph ph-mastodon-logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At my signal, unleash hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I search the faces of the gods‚Ä¶ for ways to please you, to make you proud. One kind word, one full hug‚Ä¶ where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight. Would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years. What is it in me that you hate so much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus. We mortals are but shadows and dust. Shadows and dust, Maximus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It vexes me. I‚Äôm terribly vexed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;if-you-could-live-in-any-movie-universe-which-would-you-choose&quot;&gt;If you could live in any movie universe, which would you choose?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/strong&gt;, but only if I can actually be a Wizard / non-muggle. Sure, there‚Äôs some bad stuff that goes on, y‚Äôknow, in the whole &lt;em&gt;he-who-must-not-be-named&lt;/em&gt; department, but otherwise it &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; seems pretty magical to be in that universe (again, as a Wizard of course). Apparating, morphing (transfiguring) into various animals, crafting potions and generally casting a wide variety of charms and enchantments seems super fun right? I think if I had to choose a specialization, I‚Äôd go with &lt;a href=&quot;https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogwarts_subjects#Charms&quot;&gt;Charms&lt;/a&gt;, as that seems like the classic spell-casting class that isn‚Äôt specifically dedicated to ‚Äúcombat‚Äù in the way ‚ÄúDefense Against the Dark Arts‚Äù is. Though I do love me a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_missile&quot;&gt;magic missile&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, I don‚Äôt live in the Harry Potter universe, (or I do and am just a muggle) but at least I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/11/05/security-is-magic&quot;&gt;cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-the-most-ridiculous-movie-plot-youve-ever-seen&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs the most ridiculous movie plot you‚Äôve ever seen?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might have to come back to this one later after I have time to really sit and think through the movies I‚Äôve seen to pick out the one that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; has the wildest plot‚Ä¶ but for now I‚Äôll just share what came to my mind &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0288477/&quot;&gt;Ghost Ship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It‚Äôs not entirely ridiculous, at least in my opinion, but it does have a pretty wild scene (if you‚Äôve seen it, you know what I‚Äôm talking about), and the rest of the movie is just kinda ridiculous in its own ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows, I‚Äôll probably come amend this in a few days after I have a chance to really think about it‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-movie-snack-is-an-absolute-must-have-for-you&quot;&gt;What movie snack is an absolute must-have for you?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twizzlers&lt;/strong&gt; are my go-to movie snack. A close second would be Sour Punch Straws, with good ol‚Äô fashioned, heavily-buttered, popcorn taking the third spot.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Blog question challenge is back! This time, it‚Äôs all about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#blog-questions-challenge---tv-shows&quot;&gt;TV Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;blog-questions-challenge---tv-shows&quot;&gt;Blog Questions Challenge - ‚ÄúTV Shows‚Äù&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://beep.town/@blog_challenge/114032585553571824&quot;&gt;This week‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Blog Questions Challenge&lt;/em&gt; is ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;TV Shows&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù. Here are the questions‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What TV character from a beloved show do you wish you could be best friends with in real life? [&lt;a href=&quot;#tv-friend&quot;&gt;GO&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you could binge-watch an entire series again for the first time, which one would you choose and why? [&lt;a href=&quot;#re-watch-a-show-for-the-first-time&quot;&gt;GO&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Name a TV show that changed your perspective on the world or taught you something valuable. [&lt;a href=&quot;#tv-show-that-taught-me-something&quot;&gt;GO&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‚Ä¶and one &lt;strong&gt;extra bonus question&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;how exciting&lt;/em&gt;! [&lt;a href=&quot;#bonus-tv-show-i-would-like-more-of&quot;&gt;GO&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tv-friend&quot;&gt;TV Friend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm goin‚Äô &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scrubs.fandom.com/wiki/Christopher_Turk&quot;&gt;Chris Turk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285403/&quot;&gt;Scrubs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;What‚Äôs not to like?!&lt;/em&gt; Incredibly funny, would definitely play basketball with me, can help me with my various foot injuries, and is a fiercely loyal friend. &lt;em&gt;Easy choice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;re-watch-a-show-for-the-first-time&quot;&gt;Re-watch a show for the first time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, my first thought here was Scrubs, &lt;em&gt;hah&lt;/em&gt;! It‚Äôs probably my favorite show of all time. But &lt;em&gt;honestly&lt;/em&gt;, it‚Äôs as enjoyable rewatching for the &lt;em&gt;nth&lt;/em&gt; time as it was the first time, so that won‚Äôt be my choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead&lt;/em&gt;, I‚Äôm going to go with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0773262/&quot;&gt;Dexter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Look&lt;/em&gt;, the entire show wasn‚Äôt perfect, but a lot of those seasons were amazing. I‚Äôm normally a sci-fi, or fantasy, or comedy-type of TV show-watcher, but something about this show I found very compelling and perfectly suspenseful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tv-show-that-taught-me-something&quot;&gt;TV show that taught me something&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a tough one for me. A lot of the TV shows I watch are (as I mentioned earlier) in the Sci-Fi, Fantasy or Comedy realms. Not that those can‚Äôt have teaching or world-perspective-changing qualities, but it‚Äôs just not what I am looking for when I seek the escape of TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have an answer though, and &lt;em&gt;it‚Äôs kinda funny&lt;/em&gt;‚Ä¶ &lt;strong&gt;Scrubs&lt;/strong&gt;! Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve watched that series so many times, but I actually learned a fair bit about medical / doctor / hospital &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; from that show. And I know a lot of it &lt;em&gt;is real&lt;/em&gt; as I have many friends/family members who are doctors who have said that things in that show are actually pretty on-point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-tv-show-i-would-like-more-of&quot;&gt;BONUS: TV show I would like more of&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, I‚Äôm adding an extra TV show question. The question is ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Which TV show do you wish had more episodes/seasons&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is a &lt;em&gt;gooooood&lt;/em&gt; one. As there are so many TV shows I‚Äôd like &lt;em&gt;moooarrr&lt;/em&gt; of. I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9253284/&quot;&gt;Andor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7631058/&quot;&gt;Rings of Power&lt;/a&gt;, but both of those shows are already set to come back and, give us more. So instead, I‚Äôm going to choose &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2934286/&quot;&gt;Halo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;I know, I know&lt;/em&gt;. Halo wasn‚Äôt the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; show across its two seasons, but I thought it was &lt;strong&gt;pretty good&lt;/strong&gt;. I was a Halo super-fan back in the day (&lt;em&gt;and very good if I do say so myself&lt;/em&gt;). I think that universe, and that story, has SO MUCH to offer, and would love to see it entirely explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <shark:summary><p>A lot of people worry that <a href="/notes/2024/03/13/you-have-something-to-say-someone-will-listen">no one will read their blog</a>. I did too. But it turns out, not only did people find and read what I had to say, but they were nice enough to tell me they liked it too. This post is all about that. <strong>Kindness</strong>.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people worry that &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/03/13/you-have-something-to-say-someone-will-listen&quot;&gt;no one will read their blog&lt;/a&gt;. I did too. But it turns out, not only did people find and read what I had to say, but they were nice enough to tell me they liked it too. This post is all about that. &lt;strong&gt;Kindness&lt;/strong&gt;. I‚Äôm very appreciative of everyone who has taken the time to reach out and let me know they liked something they saw on my site. Thank you! üß°&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is just a log of nice things people have reached out to me and said. Some days, when I don‚Äôt feel like writing, or I‚Äôm just bummed about the world, maybe I can come here and remember everyone who I‚Äôve helped in some small way and use it as motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there‚Äôs something, or someone you appreicate out there, just send ‚Äòem a message! I‚Äôm sure it will mean a lot to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Arjun (&lt;em&gt;4/4/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I just wanted to reach out and say a big thank you. Your work on Shellsharks and especially your article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/you-should-blog&quot;&gt;why people should blog&lt;/a&gt;. It pushed me to finally start my own blog‚Äîeven though it‚Äôs super basic right now and nowhere near as cool as Shellsharks!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve built this space to share my work, explore interesting cyber threats, and document my learnings. My goal over the next few months is to stay consistent, keep improving the site, and use it as a platform to grow and contribute to the community.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been a great learning experience so far, and I owe a lot of that inspiration to you‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks again for doing what you do‚Äîit genuinely sparked something for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Franklin (&lt;em&gt;3/27/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wanted to write a quick note and say thank you for the time, effort, and thoughtfulness you put into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/vm-bootcamp&quot;&gt;Vulnerability Management Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been trying to break into the security space for a few years now. I worked my way up from a desktop support intern to a senior analyst and earned a few certifications along the way‚Äîbut I never quite had the opportunity to pivot into a full-time security role. At times, I honestly questioned whether the field was just too saturated or if IT folks simply weren‚Äôt being given a shot in CyberSec.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Then I came across your course. I took my time and went through it thoroughly in preparation for a Security Analyst interview with a Vulnerability Management team. The bootcamp gave me so much confidence heading into the interview and it also gave me so many things to talk about. Long story short, I was able to impress the panel and I just received a job offer today ‚Äì my first CyberSec role. I look forward to checking your content more and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Nakul (&lt;em&gt;3/14/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I came across your blog (Shellsharks) while I was browsing the web for cybersec resources I found it quite insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Kai (&lt;em&gt;3/7/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;also, your website is flipping awesome. Subscribed!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Also, I might be stealing some ideas for my own site eventually üôà&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Tyler (&lt;em&gt;3/5/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm Tyler, an infosec enthusiast working toward a career in the field. I came across your blog a month or so ago while researching inspiration for my own portfolio and blog. I loved the site theme and found your content incredibly interesting and engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On (&lt;em&gt;3/5/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For real, give @shellsharks@shellsharks.social a follow. Always good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Himanshu (&lt;em&gt;3/4/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶Great work and I appreciate the work and the amount of effort you have taken to make one‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Zak (&lt;em&gt;3/3/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your website is absolute killer. You‚Äôve got the absolute knack for linking resources to relevant things, whilst keeping the momentum of the message you‚Äôre writing. I usually have CTRL held down as I read and click as I go. I always prepare myself for some rabbit-hole when your posts appear in my RSS feed. Your hyper(space)link travel post is an inspiration. I love a well-linked site so hopefully some others pick up the nudge too. I am meaning to do a similar post in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Phillip (&lt;em&gt;2/28/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;love your scrolls newsletter üòç . Always so much to discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Moahmed (&lt;em&gt;2/24/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I just want to say your indie blog website, https://shellsharks.com, has been a big inspiration for me and has helped me gain a huge amount of insight. It inspired me so much, I actually made my own indie blog website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Jeffrey (&lt;em&gt;2/24/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And your website is really cool, which must indicate that its owner is also really cool! I will add it to my indieroll ^_^&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From John (&lt;em&gt;2/20/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/devlog/shark-fin-hr&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;! Such a neat touch of personality.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Bravo, Poseidon or Aquaman or somethin‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From John (&lt;em&gt;2/18/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;as an aside, I continue to be enamoured with your site. Its such a clean design and layout, with a focus on text readability, along with having a fantastic wealth of information on it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I also love that it‚Äôs a static-generated site and not $blog_platform. I‚Äôve tried so many times to investigate static site generators, but could never close the gap between ease of use and ease of use and aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Ishmael M. (&lt;em&gt;2/18/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hi Michael! I‚Äôve been reading your Shellsharks blog posts and there are some great gems in there. It‚Äôs been great reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Hedy (&lt;em&gt;2/18/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I love the design of your site, and even moreso the thorough overview of its architecture. You‚Äôve been added to the webring, welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Arjun T. (&lt;em&gt;2/18/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello Michael, 
It feels honoured to be connected. I have no questions or the need to ask for advice from you. Just wanted to tell you, I am a huge fan of shellsharks. A huge fan. I have been checking out the site for a long time and only today I visited to about page and found you. From a reddit comment. I went ‚ÄúAHHH NO WAYYY! IT IS HIMM‚Äù Love your work. Keep doing it. Keep inspiring us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Bob (&lt;em&gt;2/13/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I love it! I like how you‚Äôve ‚Äúsurfaced‚Äù recent posts, notes, etc. The old design is also great, but I think you‚Äôve taken it up a notch or two with this one. Nice work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Eliezer G. (&lt;em&gt;1/3/25&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My name is A.K., and I currently work as a systems administrator for the University of Maryland‚Äôs helpdesk, a position I‚Äôve held for several years. I‚Äôm now exploring a transition into the vulnerability management and information security industry, and I wanted to express my sincere appreciation for the resources you‚Äôve shared in the VM Bootcamp and the Shell Sharks podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Your bootcamp content and podcast discussions have been an incredible guide as I consider this shift. I‚Äôm grateful for the clarity and depth you provide, which are especially valuable for someone new to the field. I did notice that the bootcamp was published in April 2021, and I‚Äôd love to hear if you feel the guidance you‚Äôve shared remains current or if there are updates or additional resources you‚Äôd recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your commitment to helping people like me enter this field with confidence. I look forward to any advice you may have!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From James F. (&lt;em&gt;10/21/24&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Special favourite to the InfoSec tools you use to gauge the sorts of tools professionals like your self uses, but to be honest I was very surprised at the vast quantity of tools you use for each sector!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Good afternoon, I randomly ran across your website ‚Äúshellsharks.com‚Äù from a reddit post. I am currently a cyber security student in VA and I was wondering if there is any advice you could give me as I close in on my undergraduate career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Brian B. (&lt;em&gt;9/3/23&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Michael, I couldn‚Äôt send a message without connecting (LinkedIn restriction I guess?). I stumbled across shellsharks a few days ago and was really impressed with the level of effort you have put into the content and design. The nostalgia of indie-blogging is real. Nice work and all the best. - Brian&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Mehdi B. (&lt;em&gt;9/18/23&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear Michael, 
I hope you are doing well,
I found your profile by passing trough your blog post on threat modeling. First I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, It is clearly the best ressource of threat modeling on the net. 
I want also to ask you if as you stated on the post, you plan to provide an example of your ID3 way to do threat model? It could be really helpful for me as I am doing threat modeling in my daily basis. Also if you have anything that details more your ID3 methodoloy, for example a more detailled scheme than the one on your blog I would really be interested. 
Many thanks in advance,
Mehdi&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Stumbled upon your post about a portfolio for cybersecurity on reddit. Like your work and look to learn from you further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Preston K. (&lt;em&gt;10/3/23&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hi Michael. I read your post at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/11emt8m/whats_a_day_in_the_life_of_an_application/&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/11emt8m/whats_a_day_in_the_life_of_an_application/&lt;/a&gt; and followed it to your site. I‚Äôm looking to make a move to appsec engineering and I‚Äôm training myself up at the moment. Just wanted to connect and say hi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Felicia G. (&lt;em&gt;8/22/23&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I recently came across your portfolio, shellsharks.com after Googling ‚Äòcybersecurity portfolios.‚Äô Yours looks good. Let‚Äôs keep in touch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Laorenz M. (&lt;em&gt;7/26/23&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon your website when I was looking for cybersecurity portfolios. I just started my CS journey and I got a lot more motivated thanks to you! You‚Äôre awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Seth C. (&lt;em&gt;7/12/23&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thank you for accepting my connection request! I‚Äôve been reading through your ‚Äúgetting started in Infosec‚Äù article on your website - I really appreciate the collection of information! Thank you for your advice &amp;amp; making your collection of resources available!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Diego Arteago (&lt;em&gt;6/27/23&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I just spent a few hours binge reading shellsharks.com posts. Thanks for being a mentor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Nihil D. (&lt;em&gt;6/25/23&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey man I saw your 5 year infosec blog get posted on reddit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GIAC/comments/14ikgy5/need_some_help_with_sans_courses/&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/GIAC/comments/14ikgy5/need_some_help_with_sans_courses/&lt;/a&gt; and enjoyed your blog. I am originally from the NoVA area and am trying to go there after my stint in the USAF is done next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Tyler W. (&lt;em&gt;6/6/23&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Found you through your threat modeling guide on your website. You‚Äôre a badass, my man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Sohail E. (&lt;em&gt;2/21/23&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thanks a ton for connecting with me. I just wanted to drop a quick note to say how excited I am to know that you‚Äôve your own podcast! I just realized this now. I can‚Äôt wait to give it a listen and hear all the amazing things you‚Äôre sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Todd M. (&lt;em&gt;2/12/23&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have been following your blog and Reddit posts for a while now. Keep up the great work! Your breaking into Infosec post and roadmap has been instrumental in helping me navigate my own career path. Thanks again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Mike C. (&lt;em&gt;11/27/22&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶I was on a road trip home (through the DC area, ironically) when I came across a post you had made to Reddit that linked to your experience with JHU (very informative! Thank you!). I‚Äôve been looking through Shellsharks all evening and found a link to your LinkedIn and figured, why not!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a pleasure to have made a connection with you. Have a great evening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Robert V.(&lt;em&gt;9/17/22&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Michael! We spoke briefly last year when you shared some AppSec learning resources with me via email. I‚Äôm a big fan of your blog and would love to connect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Willie N. (&lt;em&gt;10/11/22&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I found your blog recently while searching for Threat Modelling resources and was impressed with the content of your posts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I would like to connect with you to follow any future content that you might release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Ilia A. (&lt;em&gt;9/9/22&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hi Mike, I‚Äôve been reading over your InfoSec playbook. Great stuff, thanks for putting it together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Niklas J. (&lt;em&gt;8/28/22&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hi man,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know you, any you don‚Äôt know me.
But I just want to let know that I really enjoy your blog, thanks and keep it up :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Robin L. (&lt;em&gt;8/2/22&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hi Michael, I posted regarding your ‚ÄúEnchiridion‚Äù and tagged you in the post, but your name keeps dropping off for some reason. Anyway I really like the piece and your website and hope we can connect. Did you have a classical education btw? Best regards, Robin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Darrius R. (&lt;em&gt;7/25/22&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Michael, just wanted to reach out for a connection. I wanted to let you know that I am interested in vulnerability management and I was looking at your blog! It has some great stuff for anybody looking to get into the industry !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From John K. (&lt;em&gt;4/3/22&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear Michael, Follow your articles on shellshark, all absolute gold. Look forward to connect and associate with you. And learn from your experience and knowledge. Rgds, John&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From B J B. (&lt;em&gt;1/29/22&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just stumbled on your website via Reddit. One word‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..AWESOME! I‚Äôm steering into the cyber arena and I‚Äôm freshly starting out. Please continue the quality work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Will B. (&lt;em&gt;11/9/21&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hi Michael, I‚Äôm a big fan of your blog. It would be my honor to have you in my network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Michael A. (&lt;em&gt;11/5/21&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Mike, I saw your website with you reviewing all the training you have been in, which SANS course would you say is your favorite? I‚Äôve taken maybe 7 classes and most are hit or miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Lee T. (&lt;em&gt;7/7/21&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just read your blog and great job on the content, I particularly like the section about the trainings and certifications to avoid, since I was looking at a few of the SANS courses to take next. However, the Wireless Pentesting course in your write up sounds awesome. Great work on the blog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Cameron S. (&lt;em&gt;6/4/21&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nice website by the way. Just took a look at it. Sick desk setup haha&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shellsharks Doodles</title>
        <shark:summary><p>Similar to the <a href="https://doodles.google">Google Doodles</a>, my site has its <strong>Shellsharks Doodles</strong>. They are celebrations of various events and holidays throughout the year, each designed by me using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vector-svg-maker-assembly/id1024210402">Assembly</a> app. Some of the doodles are merely thematic additions to the plain shellsharks logo, while others completely re-visualize the <a href="/shellsharks-logo#shellsharks-logo-symbology">symbology</a> throughout. These doodles go up and replace the classic doodle at the appropriate times throughout the year.</p>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doodles.google&quot;&gt;Google Doodles&lt;/a&gt;, my site has its &lt;strong&gt;Shellsharks Doodles&lt;/strong&gt;. They are celebrations of various events and holidays throughout the year, each designed by me using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vector-svg-maker-assembly/id1024210402&quot;&gt;Assembly&lt;/a&gt; app. Some of the doodles are merely thematic additions to the plain shellsharks logo, while others completely re-visualize the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#shellsharks-logo-symbology&quot;&gt;symbology&lt;/a&gt; throughout. These doodles go up and replace the classic doodle at the appropriate times throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why did I design these?&lt;/em&gt; Just for fun I guess. &lt;em&gt;Why these particular events/holidays?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Well&lt;/em&gt;, I did what I could with the limited icon sets that were available within the Assembly app at the time. &lt;em&gt;Will I make more doodles?&lt;/em&gt; I hadn‚Äôt thought about it for a while, but I can definitely see myself doing more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
  .item {
    background-color: var(--background-color);
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 20px;
  }
  .contain {

      padding: 20px;

  .twox {

    .contain {
      display: block;
    }
    .contain &gt; div {
      margin-bottom:20px;
    }
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;contain&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;
    The &lt;b&gt;classic&lt;/b&gt; logo. Read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#shellsharks-logo-symbology&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/avatar.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;
    The &lt;b&gt;New Years&lt;/b&gt; logo, basically the same as the classic logo, but with lotsa fireworks, some bottles poppin&apos;, a sign with the &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; year on it, and some fancy sharks with bowties. ü¶à ‚ãà üòÑ.
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/logos/avatar-newyears.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;
    The &lt;b&gt;Valentines Day&lt;/b&gt; logo is also just the classic logo with a bunch of hearts and flowers added in various places. There are some &quot;easter eggs&quot; and li&apos;l bonus things though. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#weaponization&quot;&gt;weaponization&lt;/a&gt; circle has a &quot;&lt;i&gt;love potion&lt;/i&gt;&quot; in the middle. For some reason I&apos;ve put a planet that kinda looks like Venus (the roman goddess of love) in there (with the number &apos;2&apos; next to it as Venus is the second planet from the sun). I also pay homage to the classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILOVEYOU&quot;&gt;ILOVEYOU&lt;/a&gt; virus in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#exploitation&quot;&gt;exploitation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#installation&quot;&gt;installation&lt;/a&gt; phases. Also looks like I changed the binary message around the outside of the logo, but honestly don&apos;t remember what it&apos;s supposed to say. A challenge for someone out there perhaps? üß°
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/logos/avatar-valentines.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;
    Here&apos;s a funny one, &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nationaltoday.com/world-circus-day&quot;&gt;World Circus Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Here things have gotten completely wacky, but you should appreciate that each of the inner circles still attempt to symbolize &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#the-cyber-kill-chain&quot;&gt;The Cyber Kill Chain&lt;/a&gt;. You&apos;ve gotta use your imagination of course, but I&apos;m sure you can kinda see what I was goin&apos; for across each of the kill-chain steps. Notably we&apos;ve got a cannon as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#delivery&quot;&gt;delivery&lt;/a&gt; mechanism and a &quot;magician&quot; pulling a rabbit out of a &quot;hat&quot; as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#exploitation&quot;&gt;exploitation&lt;/a&gt; phase. There&apos;s also a &lt;i&gt;Golden Ticket&lt;/i&gt; - wanna guess what that might be referencing? Everything else is, as you can plainly see, &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; circus-ey. &lt;i&gt;Oh&lt;/i&gt;, and I&apos;ve got swingin&apos; monkey in there for good measure. üé™ üôà
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/logos/avatar-circus.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;
    The &lt;b&gt;Earth Day&lt;/b&gt; logo is a favorite of mine. It&apos;s again, just the classic logo, but with &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;earth-ey&lt;/i&gt; stuff all over the place. Plants just growin&apos; out from everything. My favorite part of this logo has got to be the great tree growing on the outside of the logo itself. üåé
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/logos/avatar-earthday.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;
    The &lt;b&gt;Columbus Day&lt;/b&gt; logo is honestly one I haven&apos;t really used, but &lt;i&gt;technically&lt;/i&gt; have around. Given the general &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/news/columbus-day-controversy&quot;&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt; surrounding Columbus, and the holiday, it&apos;ll probably remain dormant. It&apos;s nothing but a few boats anyway.
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/logos/avatar-columbus.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;
    The &lt;b&gt;Halloween&lt;/b&gt; logo is another very intricate, thematic design. Each smaller circle on the interior of the logo has been re-made in a &lt;i&gt;spooky&lt;/i&gt; fashion. We&apos;ve got zombies screaming &quot;&lt;i&gt;BRAINS~!!!&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, witches flyin&apos; every which way and plenty of ghouls and ghosties. But the best part? The &lt;i&gt;scariest&lt;/i&gt; part? Is all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/designer-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;named vulns&lt;/a&gt; and their respective CVEs I&apos;ve referenced in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#exploitation&quot;&gt;exploitation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#installation&quot;&gt;installation&lt;/a&gt; phases. &lt;i&gt;Even better&lt;/i&gt;? Each of those named vulns are ones that have kinda spooky names too, e.g. &quot;&lt;i&gt;Cable Haunt&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;i&gt;ZombieLoad&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Stagefright&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Spectre&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, to name a few. There&apos;s a lot more in there too! Turns out vuln researchers like scary-sounding vuln names. üëª
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/logos/avatar-halloween.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;
    Last, but certainly not least, is the &lt;b&gt;Christmas&lt;/b&gt; doodle. It&apos;s easily the one I&apos;m the most proud of. I think I really nailed the &lt;i&gt;Christmas-to-Kill-Chain&lt;/i&gt; symbology throughout, following &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/santa-ttps&quot;&gt;Santa&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; journey to put presents under your tree. üéÖ üéÅ üéÑ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#&quot;&gt;Reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt;: First, Santa performs recon, reviewing his famed &lt;i&gt;Naughty &amp;amp; Nice&lt;/i&gt; list.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#&quot;&gt;Weaponization&lt;/a&gt;: Only so much I can do visually with &quot;exploitation&quot;, so here you get an assortment of random xmas-&lt;i&gt;stuff&lt;/i&gt; and a particularly evil looking snowman.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#&quot;&gt;Delivery&lt;/a&gt;: The sleigh is loaded, and 8 tiny reindeer are ready to mount to the sky! Rudolph has even made his appearance.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#&quot;&gt;Exploitation&lt;/a&gt;: The chimney is Santa&apos;s favored exploitation vector.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/a&gt;: The gifts are then &quot;&lt;i&gt;installed&lt;/i&gt;&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#&quot;&gt;C2&lt;/a&gt;: A new reindeer appears - &lt;i&gt;On HAXXEN!!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-logo#&quot;&gt;Actions on Objectives&lt;/a&gt;: Finally, Santa has delivered the presents, and he makes off with his favorite snack - a &lt;i&gt;session&lt;/i&gt;-cookie!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;i&gt;Merry Haxmas to All and to All a Good Night!!&lt;/i&gt;

        <title>Surviving the Brave New World</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is a dangerous place, and complexity abounds, moreso &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; it seems than it ever has been. Navigating a world filled with AI-fueled disinformation, corporate-backed algorithmic control, political information silos and worse is no easy feat. So how can we trust what we see? How can we communicate safely? How can we protect ourselves in a digital warzone? How can we build and sustain our communities? How can we do all of this in light of the powers that seek to isolate, confuse, depress and control us? Here are some resources for staying safe and surviving‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;containbox&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;shellsharks&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Like most things on my site, this is a &quot;living resource&quot;. I will add and update this post as I discover new things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a &lt;b&gt;call for contributions&lt;/b&gt;! If you have tips, advice, additional resources that fit into these categories, I want to know about them so I can add it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, and stay safe out there!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#news&quot;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#social-media&quot;&gt;Social Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#self-hosting&quot;&gt;Self-Hosting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;news&quot;&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disinformation, misinformation, biased news, whatever. It‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;. How can you know what you are reading is &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;? Who speaks truth to power? Where can you go to get the actual &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt;? We all know the traditional news outlets have capitulated, and the behemoth centralized platforms will suppress and annihilate news they deem unfit to the narrative. There‚Äôs no silver bullet here, but there are sources of light and truth you can plug into. Here‚Äôs some recommendations (&lt;em&gt;none of these are foolproof sources, remember to &lt;a href=&quot;#fact-checking&quot;&gt;fact check&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;!)‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;news-sources&quot;&gt;News Sources&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org&quot;&gt;ProPublica&lt;/a&gt;: An independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism with moral force.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co&quot;&gt;404 Media&lt;/a&gt;: Journalist-founded digital media company exploring the ways technology is shaping‚Äìand is shaped by‚Äìour world.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com&quot;&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lawfaremedia.org&quot;&gt;Lawfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motherjones.com&quot;&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com&quot;&gt;The New Republic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and some resources for finding further news‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trustworthymedia.org/list-of-independent-media/&quot;&gt;Trustworthy Media&lt;/a&gt;: Provides a list of independent media sources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://findyournews.org&quot;&gt;FindYourNews&lt;/a&gt;: A place to discover and connect with public service newsrooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Have other news sources you recommend? Have concerns about one of the sources listed here? Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/contact&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;fact-checking&quot;&gt;Fact-Checking&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to find secondary sources to verify/corroborate any news/information you see online. Some fact-checking resources‚Ä¶(&lt;em&gt;thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@AAKL/112360914145670561&quot;&gt;AAKL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.factcheck.org/&quot;&gt;FactCheck.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/&quot;&gt;WaPo Politics Fact Checker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politifact.com/&quot;&gt;PolitiFact.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/&quot;&gt;Snopes Fact Checks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/fact-check&quot;&gt;Reuters Fact Check&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/hub/ap-fact-check&quot;&gt;AP Fact Check&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fullfact.org/latest/&quot;&gt;Full Fact Latest fact checks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker/lookupscam&quot;&gt;Better Business Bureau Scam Tracker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶and a few &lt;em&gt;link checkers&lt;/em&gt; to ensure the links are free from malware, phishing, etc‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nordvpn.com/link-checker/&quot;&gt;NordVPN link checker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipvanish.com/link-checker/&quot;&gt;IPVanish Link Checker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt look for news on the big centralized social networks. They &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; censor things of import. Instead, find some trustworthy sources on decentralized &lt;a href=&quot;#social-media&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;social-media&quot;&gt;Social Media&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I‚Äôll just say it&lt;/em&gt;. The centralized platforms are bad (for a lot of reasons I‚Äôll cover). Facebook, Twitter (X), Instagram, TikTok, even Bluesky. That‚Äôs not to say they aren‚Äôt entertaining, or an easy way to communicate with friends &amp;amp; family, but they are bad for a lot of &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; reasons. Propagating disinformation, rampant censorship, heavy-handed moderation, shady ownership, privacy violations, enshittification, you name it. So what‚Äôs the solution? Is there a perfect social media utopia to run to? &lt;em&gt;Of course not&lt;/em&gt;. But we do have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, something that is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2025/01/15/bluesky-wont-free-your-feed#title&quot;&gt;actually&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; resilient in the face of ever-expanding oligarchic and governmental control. That something is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/fediverse&quot;&gt;Fediverse&lt;/a&gt; - a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; decentralized social media network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don‚Äôt just take it from me, take a look at the following stories on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/decentralized-social-media-is-the-only-alternative-to-the-tech-oligarchy/&quot;&gt;Decentralized Social Media Is the Only Alternative to the Tech Oligarchy | 404 Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to further understand why the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jointhefediverse.net&quot;&gt;Fediverse&lt;/a&gt; is better? Read through &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/11/16/hark-threaders-the-fediverse-is-good-for-you#why-mastodon--fediverse-is-good&quot;&gt;these benefits&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; is one of the more popular Fediverse-enabled platforms, I‚Äôve got the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/mastodon&quot;&gt;following guide&lt;/a&gt; if you‚Äôre interested in learning more. Want to take it to the next level and &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/own-my-social&quot;&gt;own your own fediverse instance&lt;/a&gt;? Here‚Äôs some &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/08/01/fediverse-managed-hosting-providers&quot;&gt;managed hosting providers&lt;/a&gt; to help you achieve that. Looking to go beyond micro-blogging? The ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/threadiversal-travel&quot;&gt;Threadiverse&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù is the Fediverse‚Äôs answer to Reddit being awful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;self-hosting&quot;&gt;Self-Hosting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our reliance on big tech is dangerous. Given their willingness to fold in the face of governmental pressure, by governments who might not have &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; best interests in mind, there is little assurance they will safeguard data you entrust to them, nor can we be certain that we won‚Äôt be deplatformed. So, we must learn to self-host the services that matter. It requires some know-how, some cash and in many cases some hardware, but it can be done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some self-hosting-related resources‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;communication&quot;&gt;Communication&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to be able to communicate &lt;em&gt;securely&lt;/em&gt;. Social media is not the place for this, not even decentralized social media. &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt; is a highly-recommended option for secure commmunications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;Community&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you can‚Äôt rely on the government or corporations to protect and care for you, you must fallback on your community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While everything in the world seems to be enshittifying and fully capitulating, there are some standouts. Here are some services/organizations still worth supporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest in the IndieWeb community‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;blog challenges&lt;/em&gt; is the &lt;strong&gt;Music Questions Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;. Similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/get-to-know-my-blog#title&quot;&gt;last blogging challenge&lt;/a&gt; I did, it consists of a &lt;a href=&quot;#music-challenge-questions&quot;&gt;series of questions&lt;/a&gt; that I‚Äôll answer throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the idea from &lt;a href=&quot;https://flamedfury.com/posts/music-questions-challenge/&quot;&gt;Flamed Fury&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.shrediverse.net/posts/music-questions-challenge-repost&quot;&gt;The Shrediverse&lt;/a&gt; (though no one ‚Äútagged‚Äù me, I‚Äôm goin‚Äô for it anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;music-challenge-questions&quot;&gt;Music Challenge Questions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; questions that make up the ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;Music Questions Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#what-are-five-of-your-favorite-albums&quot;&gt;What are five of your favorite albums?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#what-are-five-of-your-favorite-songs&quot;&gt;What are five of your favorite songs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#favorite-instruments&quot;&gt;Favorite Instrument(s)?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#what-song-or-album-are-you-current-listening-to&quot;&gt;What song or album are you current listening to?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-are-five-of-your-favorite-albums&quot;&gt;What are five of your favorite albums?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote about my ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/09/13/zero-skip-albums&quot;&gt;Zero-skip albums&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù, but though I like each song on those albums, that doesn‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; make them my favorite. Though there is plenty of cross-over between that list and the one below. Here‚Äôs my five favorites (in no particular order)‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/528436018&quot;&gt;Hybrid Theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Linkin Park&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;THE&lt;/strong&gt; formative music for me. I still love it the same as I did in like middle school.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/1463553489&quot;&gt;A Night at the Opera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Blind Guardian&lt;/strong&gt;: If you like power metal (and you should), &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the band you should listen to. This album is haunting and beautiful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/365400149&quot;&gt;In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Coheed and Cambria&lt;/strong&gt;: First heard this in highschool. Coheed is one of my favorite artists of all time and this is my favorite of their albums.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/1612119036&quot;&gt;Jackpot Juicer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dance Gavin Dance&lt;/strong&gt;: I love every song on this album just-about. It‚Äôs one of my go-tos for working out too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/1049014094&quot;&gt;Close to the Edge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;: I went through a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; Yes phase around my college years. This album was on constant repeat. I don‚Äôt listen to it nearly as much nowadays, but it forever remains in my top albums list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some honorable mentions‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/1049017157&quot;&gt;The Yes Album&lt;/a&gt;, Yes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/104575301&quot;&gt;Us Against the Crown&lt;/a&gt;, State Radio&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/192898041&quot;&gt;Gravity&lt;/a&gt;, Our Lady Peace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/158537764&quot;&gt;Happiness‚Ä¶Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch&lt;/a&gt;, Our Lady Peace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/1440736868&quot;&gt;Deloused in the Comatorium&lt;/a&gt;, The Mars Volta&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/1647226960&quot;&gt;Treehouse&lt;/a&gt;, I See Stars&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/1030144485&quot;&gt;Believe&lt;/a&gt;, Disturbed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/617154241&quot;&gt;Random Access Memories&lt;/a&gt;, Daft Punk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/1500769750&quot;&gt;The Afterman: Descension&lt;/a&gt;, Coheed and Cambria&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/266363140&quot;&gt;No World for Tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;, Coheed and Cambria&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/307654866&quot;&gt;Good Apollo I‚Äôm Burning Star IV&lt;/a&gt;, Coheed and Cambria&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/1440871444&quot;&gt;Saturate&lt;/a&gt;, Breaking Benjamin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/187454164&quot;&gt;Make Yourself&lt;/a&gt;, Incubus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-are-five-of-your-favorite-songs&quot;&gt;What are five of your favorite songs?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ooph&lt;/em&gt;, choosing just five is tough. But here goes‚Ä¶ (will save my #1 favorite &lt;a href=&quot;#whats-your-favourite-song-of-all-time&quot;&gt;for later&lt;/a&gt;, so there‚Äôs a bonus here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://song.link/us/i/579377477&quot;&gt;No Leaf Clover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Metallica&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://song.link/us/i/365400459&quot;&gt;In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Coheed and Cambria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://song.link/us/i/1389971322&quot;&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Guns &amp;amp; Roses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://song.link/us/i/1460726104&quot;&gt;And Then There Was Silence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Blind Guardian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://song.link/us/i/604865358&quot;&gt;Close to the Edge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt; (The &lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/604864905&quot;&gt;Yessongs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Live&lt;/em&gt; version)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;favorite-instruments&quot;&gt;Favorite Instrument(s)?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess probably &lt;strong&gt;guitar&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-song-or-album-are-you-current-listening-to&quot;&gt;What song or album are you current listening to?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently I‚Äôve been listening to the Weeknd‚Äôs new album, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/1793654348&quot;&gt;Hurry Up Tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. But since writing this piece I‚Äôve been listening to various of my favorites listed throughout this piece. At this &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; moment, I‚Äôm listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://song.link/us/i/604865358&quot;&gt;Close To The Edge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;do-you-listen-to-the-radio-if-so-how-often&quot;&gt;Do you listen to the radio? If so, how often?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nope.&lt;/strong&gt; Though I do listen to Apple Music ‚Äúradio stations‚Äù from time to time to &lt;a href=&quot;#how-often-do-you-discover-music-and-how-do-you-discover-music&quot;&gt;discover new music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-often-do-you-listen-to-music&quot;&gt;How often do you listen to music?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every day&lt;/strong&gt;, multiple times a day. I‚Äôll listen to music while I work, while I clean up around the house, and (&lt;em&gt;loudly&lt;/em&gt;) when I work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-often-do-you-discover-music-and-how-do-you-discover-music&quot;&gt;How often do you discover music? And how do you discover music?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not as often as I should. I go through spurts of discovery a few times a year at best. I primarly discover music through Apple Music stations that I create based on other music I like. Though I‚Äôve been increasingly discovering music via social media. Shoutout to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dmv.community/@jcrabapple&quot;&gt;@jcrabapple&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-a-song-or-album-that-you-enjoy-that-you-wish-had-more-recognition&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs a song or album that you enjoy that you wish had more recognition?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting question for me. Honestly I don‚Äôt have a great sense of what songs/albums/artists have what recognition. The album &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://album.link/us/i/1443510204&quot;&gt;From One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Ra&lt;/strong&gt; is amazing and I really have never heard of anyone talk about this artist before. &lt;em&gt;Go listen to it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-your-favourite-song-of-all-time&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs your favourite song of all time?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one was painfully tough. But I gotta go with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://song.link/us/i/580708180&quot;&gt;Stairway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;has-your-taste-in-music-evolved-over-the-years&quot;&gt;Has your taste in music evolved over the years?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways yes, in other ways eh‚Ä¶ I have a huge music library and enjoy &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of different things. But when it comes to music I &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; put on and listen to, my taste has been the same for a decent while now. I previously wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/05/15/nostalgia-music&quot;&gt;music that is particularly nostalgic for me&lt;/a&gt;, but this doesn‚Äôt necssarily reflect all I was listening to throughout the years. An attempt to ‚Äúsum up‚Äù my music taste(s) throughout the years is below‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-High School&lt;/strong&gt;: Linkin Park, Papa Roach and similar stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High School&lt;/strong&gt;: Coheed and Cambria, In Flames, other death metal, Led Zeppelin, Lots of classic rock&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, State Radio&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-College-Now&lt;/strong&gt;: I find myself listening to a lot of rock and metal, so pretty similar to how it‚Äôs always beeen. Notably less classic rock in my routine listening fwiw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, I challenge/tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://mkultra.monster&quot;&gt;CMDR Nova&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vzqk50.com/whoami/&quot;&gt;Apis Necros&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <shark:summary><p>I first learned about, and joined <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a> (and thus the <a href="https://www.fediverse.to">Fediverse</a>) back in August of 2018.

It was only shortly after re-joining in 2022 though that I had the thought - ‚Äúdamn, I wish I had stuck with Mastodon for the last 4 years and had worked to build and grow my community here‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not really a content creator, at least not in the sense that I make stuff to profit from it, or to build any sort of clout. Sure, I‚Äôd like people to read and tell me what they think, so that I can improve, but it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm on social media trying to amass followers for the typical reasons. I like the folks I‚Äôve met since being on Mastodon/the Fediverse. I‚Äôve spent quite a bit of time making new friends, curating my feeds and learning about cool stuff, like the Fediverse, and like the IndieWeb. I wish I had never left. So now &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/11/15/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-not-enshittifying&quot;&gt;Bluesky is a thing&lt;/a&gt;. Threads is also around (though they claim they will &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/21/networking-traffic/threads-has-entered-the-fediverse/&quot;&gt;federate&lt;/a&gt;). I‚Äôm staying put. I think you should too. But I completely understand if you want to go elsewhere. I do think the day will come though. Maybe in 4 years, maybe longer, that people will come back here and say ‚Äúdamn, I wish I had stuck with Mastodon‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So‚Ä¶ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KetzG3D4J64&quot;&gt;Hold the line. Stay with me!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cloudy with a chance of not enshittifying</title>
        <shark:summary><p>One of the more prevalent topics of conversation on social media is - <strong>social media itself</strong>. Not sure if it‚Äôs really always been this way, but in the wake of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">Musk-ening of Twitter</a> that birthed (or rekindled) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23429095/twitter-social-network-alternatives-mastodon-reddit-tumblr-cohost">so many other social platforms</a>, my feed(s) are constantly a-buzz with hot-takes, analyses, <a href="/notes/2024/02/23/exhausted-by-social-platform-cheerleading">cheerleading</a> and more, all about social media itself.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the more prevalent topics of conversation on social media is - &lt;strong&gt;social media itself&lt;/strong&gt;. Not sure if it‚Äôs really always been this way, but in the wake of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk&quot;&gt;Musk-ening of Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that birthed (or rekindled) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/23429095/twitter-social-network-alternatives-mastodon-reddit-tumblr-cohost&quot;&gt;so many other social platforms&lt;/a&gt;, my feed(s) are constantly a-buzz with hot-takes, analyses, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/02/23/exhausted-by-social-platform-cheerleading&quot;&gt;cheerleading&lt;/a&gt; and more, all about social media itself. So, to add to that, here‚Äôs some &lt;em&gt;musings&lt;/em&gt; on what‚Äôs goin‚Äô on in the social media landscape right now‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;bluesky&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs start with &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;. For whatever reason (probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euronews.com/culture/2024/11/13/how-the-us-election-result-is-pushing-social-media-users-away-from-x-and-onto-bluesky&quot;&gt;anti-‚ÄúX‚Äù sentiment&lt;/a&gt; following the US election), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293920/bluesky-700000-new-users-week-x-threads&quot;&gt;Bluesky is seeing a surge in new users&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôve experienced this first-hand in fact. I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/shellsharks.com&quot;&gt;Bluesky account&lt;/a&gt; and (probably thanks to a &lt;a href=&quot;#on-starter-packs&quot;&gt;Starter Pack&lt;/a&gt; or two that I am in) I have seen a ton of follows lately, nearly 1k+ in the past few days alone. This has unsurprisingly resulted in a lot of chatter on my Mastodon/Fedi feeds about Bluesky. A fair bit of, ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Bluesky looks cool, I‚Äôm going to check it out&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù, ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;I‚Äôm going to move over to Bluesky permanently&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù and of course, stuff like ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Bluesky is a VC-funded, faux-decentralized bad place that will enshittify and fail in the same way Twitter did&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù. &lt;em&gt;Yeah&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#bluesky-emotions&quot;&gt;people are hot about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a surface level, I understand. People want &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; network to ‚Äúwin‚Äù. They want the people they care about to be on the same network they are, not fragmented. They also don‚Äôt want to have to pick up and move to another place and rebuild their community, etc‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;I get it&lt;/em&gt;. There‚Äôs a lot I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; say about Bluesky, and maybe one day I might say more, but for the sake of this note, I‚Äôll limit things to a few select topics‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#bluesky-emotions&quot;&gt;Negative emotions regarding folks going to Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#jack-dorsey&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#vc-backed&quot;&gt;Bluesky funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#is-bluesky-decentralized&quot;&gt;Is Bluesky decentralized?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#what-i-think-you-should-do&quot;&gt;What I think you should do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#bridgy-fed&quot;&gt;Bridgy Fed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#on-starter-packs&quot;&gt;Starter Packs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bluesky-emotions&quot;&gt;Bluesky Emotions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bluesky is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293920/bluesky-700000-new-users-week-x-threads&quot;&gt;popping off&lt;/a&gt;, people are leaving X en-masse it seems, and there are some who are also leaving Threads and Mastodon to ‚Äúlive‚Äù there too. So you have those on Bluesky cheering that they‚Äôve ‚Äúwon‚Äù, or that they‚Äôve &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/hailey.at/post/3lasky252dc2i&quot;&gt;reached the top of the charts&lt;/a&gt; (on the Apple App Store) and you have those on the fled networks (namely Mastodon) bemoaning that anyone would leave as Bluesky is yet another corpo-owned, &lt;a href=&quot;#vc-backed&quot;&gt;VC-backed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#is-bluesky-decentralized&quot;&gt;centralized&lt;/a&gt; network, &lt;a href=&quot;#longevity-of-bluesky&quot;&gt;doomed&lt;/a&gt; to the same enshittified/billionaire-owned future as the rest of them. &lt;em&gt;Phew&lt;/em&gt;! That‚Äôs a lot of emotions ‚Äì&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davxy/113480586904963235&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@securingdev/113481633335287189&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@eric_capuano/113478260587581071&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://esq.social/@andrew/113477122438980886&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@yorush/post/DCR0qvBOOdw&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://swecyb.com/@nopatience/113482488715466008&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hachyderm.io/@davidculley/113474658103543325&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://universeodon.com/@cryptadamist/113472115447080382&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackers.town/@CyberpunkLibrarian/113483028690175386&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://syzito.xyz/@Black_Flag/113486698746459772&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@timb_machine/113487227663724826&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; and so many more‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the networks, yes, even ‚ÄúX‚Äù have their pros and cons - depending on what you want and who you are. The ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://fedi.tips/what-is-mastodon-what-is-the-fediverse/&quot;&gt;Fediverse&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù, being &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; decentralized, and not owned or funded by VC/corporations means it has &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/11/16/hark-threaders-the-fediverse-is-good-for-you&quot;&gt;certain qualities&lt;/a&gt; that many of us value. It also means it lacks certain things that are present in centralized, or better-funded operations such as &lt;a href=&quot;#threads&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;#bluesky&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you‚Äôre interested in joining Bluesky. Should you try it out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;do-it&quot;&gt;Do it.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href=&quot;#bluesky&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; is where the action is. If it‚Äôs where your friends are. If it‚Äôs where the accounts you want to follow are. If it‚Äôs where your audience is. Then &lt;strong&gt;go there&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Be there&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; it would meet the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/11/23019836/elon-musk-twitter-board-of-directors-news-updates&quot;&gt;same fate as Twitter&lt;/a&gt; ultimately did, would you not ride that ride for 15 years? For all of Twitter‚Äôs faults, even pre-Musk, people &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; it. Twitter helped birth and incubate countless relationships, communities, businesses and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/c/23972308/twitter-x-death-tweets-history-elon-musk&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, and it wasn‚Äôt forever. But it was great for so many, and for a non-trivial amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bluesky &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be this too, for as long as capitalism allows. For many, maybe for most, it would be worth spending 10-15 years there only to meet the same calamitous end rather than homesteading in Fedi-land where yeah, they may achieve true social longevity outside of corporate control but would also sacrifice all they may be able to build in what could amount to a true ‚ÄúTwitter 2.0‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm Fedi-first. I like it here. I &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/11/16/hark-threaders-the-fediverse-is-good-for-you&quot;&gt;qualities&lt;/a&gt; of the Fediverse that no other platform offers. I like that I can own my own instance. I like that I can‚Äôt be deplatformed. I like that I don‚Äôt see ads. I like that it can‚Äôt be taken down by a billionaire or a single government. I like a lot of things about it. I‚Äôve also put the time and effort in to build a community here, to curate a very lively and fulfilling feed. I don‚Äôt fault anyone for going to Bluesky. If you like it there, great! I hope I get to see you through &lt;a href=&quot;#bridgy-fed&quot;&gt;the bridge&lt;/a&gt;. If you don‚Äôt end up liking it there. Well maybe you‚Äôll come back to the Fediverse ‚ÅÇ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems others too are optimistic, even if mildly cautious, about the future of Bluesky. So go ahead, try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://werd.io/2024/bluesky-the-fediverse-and-the-future-of-social-media&quot;&gt;Bluesky, the Fediverse, and the future of social media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mmasnick.bsky.social/post/3lawnzaqaqs2c&quot;&gt;Protocols, Not Platforms‚Ä¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;longevity-of-bluesky&quot;&gt;Longevity of Bluesky&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us telling people to steer clear from Bluesky usually have one or more of the following things to say‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It was founded by &lt;a href=&quot;#jack-dorsey&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;yuck!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;#vc-backed&quot;&gt;VC-backed&lt;/a&gt; (and doesn‚Äôt have a long-term funding strategy)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs a &lt;a href=&quot;#is-bluesky-decentralized&quot;&gt;centralized&lt;/a&gt; platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;jack-dorsey&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Jack Dorsey topic, go listen to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.flipboard.com/fediverse/jay-graber/&quot;&gt;Dot Social podcast episode&lt;/a&gt; with Bluesky‚Äôs founder and CEO &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team&quot;&gt;Jay Graber&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, Dorsey did help fund Bluesky &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106&quot;&gt;in the beginning&lt;/a&gt;. But has since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/07/jack-dorsey-quits-bluesky-board-urges-users-stay-elon-musk-x-twitter&quot;&gt;cut ties&lt;/a&gt;, left their board and gone on to twiddle away with &lt;a href=&quot;https://nostr.com&quot;&gt;Nostr&lt;/a&gt; and tell people to stay on X ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. So is his early involvement alone enough to curse the Bluesky project for eternity? I personally don‚Äôt think so. But &lt;em&gt;you do you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;vc-backed&quot;&gt;VC-Backed&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;. Bluesky did recently receive 15 million dollars in a Series A funding round, the majority of that money coming from the VC firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blockchaincapital.com/blog/bluesky-13m-users-and-growing-our-investment-in-blueskys-re-imagined-social-network&quot;&gt;Blockchain Capital&lt;/a&gt; (BCAP). What does this mean? &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a&quot;&gt;Bluesky will tell you&lt;/a&gt; that their new benefactor ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;shares our philosophy&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù and that neither the Bluesky app, nor underlying &lt;a href=&quot;https://atproto.com&quot;&gt;AT Protocol&lt;/a&gt; uses blockchains and/or cryptocurrency. That is all well and good. &lt;em&gt;For now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm no expert on how venture capital works, so excuse me if I say anything incorrect or naive, but my understanding is these firms don‚Äôt just &lt;em&gt;give money away&lt;/em&gt;. They expect high-growth, and they expect a &lt;strong&gt;return&lt;/strong&gt; on their investment. Even if they have no intention of somehow influencing Bluesky to incorporate any blockchain and/or cryptocurrency related technologies into the platform, they do at minimum expect Bluesky to make money, and a lot of it. So how will Bluesky do that? Right now they‚Äôre early stage. So it‚Äôs fine if they don‚Äôt have a monetization strategy that can yield the type of growth that BCAP expects. So far, all we know about how they plan to continue funding is &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah, selling domain names isn‚Äôt going to be enough. Maybe they have some ideas up their sleeves. Or maybe they don‚Äôt now, but they will later. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mmasnick.bsky.social/post/3lauwsf4eic27&quot;&gt;Who knows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at how other similar platforms have made their returns and you start to see the issues. We‚Äôve got selling ads, selling user data, ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278666/bluesky-working-on-premium-subscription&quot;&gt;premium&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù subscriptions and worse. Best case scenario (from my perspective), their dream of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#is-bluesky-decentralized&quot;&gt;decentralization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; will be realized and the costs of running the network will transition to smaller, indepedent entities, thus alleviating the funding burden to a degree. But how will those entities, in turn fund their operations? By the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification&quot;&gt;enshitty&lt;/a&gt; means? Or through crowd-sourced user donations (similar to the Fediverse model)? On this, I‚Äôd love to see them thread the needle, and succeed where no other network has yet to. But I (and others) remain skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/02/ulysses-pact/#tie-yourself-to-a-federated-mast&quot;&gt;Bluesky and enshittification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blahaj.zone/notes/a0mlkrgmas5i01j0&quot;&gt;Concern about Bluesky‚Äôs adjaceny to fascism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;is-bluesky-decentralized&quot;&gt;Is Bluesky ‚ÄúDecentralized‚Äù&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs dig into Bluesky‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.social/about/bluesky-and-the-at-protocol-usable-decentralized-social-media-martin-kleppmann.pdf&quot;&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; of being ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù. To start, I‚Äôll say that Bluesky is in no meaningful way decentralized &lt;strong&gt;at the moment&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Sure&lt;/em&gt;, they‚Äôve open sourced &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; stuff to allow you to, in theory, stand up (&lt;a href=&quot;https://alice.bsky.sh/post/3laega7icmi2q&quot;&gt;most of&lt;/a&gt;) the infra to have a decentralized node on the network, but no meaningful amount of accounts live outside of the main centralized Bluesky corp-owned stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; Bluesky &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; decentralized? This is up for debate it seems. There are two parts of this story to me. The &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;. On whether it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be decentralized, you‚Äôre welcome to peruse the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atproto.com&quot;&gt;AT Protocol&lt;/a&gt; documentation and decide for yourself. Others, smarter and more determined than myself have done this and came away rather, &lt;em&gt;unconvinced&lt;/em&gt; (read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rys.io/en/167.html&quot;&gt;BlueSky is cosplaying decentralization&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://destructured.net/bluesky-structure&quot;&gt;The structure of the Bluesky network&lt;/a&gt;). Again, maybe it‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; possible to have truly decentralized stacks that can operate independently (though again, there‚Äôs that pesky &lt;a href=&quot;https://alice.bsky.sh/post/3laega7icmi2q&quot;&gt;AppView&lt;/a&gt; issue right now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs just &lt;em&gt;assume&lt;/em&gt; that it is possible. So the question then becomes, &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; people actually do this? Will &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; people stand up fully-functioning, isolated but connected instances of the entire Bluesky tech stack? This is the more meaningful question I think. As we have seen with the ‚ÄúFediverse‚Äù, decentralization can be messy. It requires people understand the technology and be able to correctly build and maintain the necessary infrastructure. It requires folks to then &lt;em&gt;fund&lt;/em&gt; that infrastructure. &lt;strong&gt;Not easy&lt;/strong&gt;. In the Bluesky universe, who‚Äôs going to do this? Individuals? Communities? Other corporations? What is the incentive? In so many ways, the people who have gravitated &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; Bluesky and other centralized platforms is for no other reason than that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; centralized. That &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the benefit. If Bluesky achieves any meaningful level of decentralization, and that‚Äôs a big IF, they will then have the same issues that have plagued the Fediverse, i.e. instance-to-instance incompatibility, fiefdoms, instance closure (due to funding-issues among other things), annoyance around what instance to join, etc‚Ä¶ Sure, Bluesky has solved for some of this with their admittedly great version of portable identity on the network, but I still think any decentralized future for Bluesky will introduce issues, most importantly, issues that prevent Bluesky from ever reaching &lt;em&gt;meaningful&lt;/em&gt; levels of decentrality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-think-you-should-do&quot;&gt;What I Think You Should Do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so you‚Äôre joining &lt;a href=&quot;#bluesky&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, or maybe you‚Äôre &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; about it being your primary social platform. Here‚Äôs what I would suggest. &lt;a href=&quot;#do-it&quot;&gt;Do it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Check it out&lt;/em&gt;! Or let it be your main social point of presence. It‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;. If you like it, then that‚Äôs great. But here‚Äôs some things you might consider doing in tandem‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bridgy-fed&quot;&gt;Bridgy Fed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fed.brid.gy&quot;&gt;Bridgy Fed&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome service that among other things, can bridge accounts from the Fediverse to Bluesky and in reverse from Bluesky to the Fediverse. From the Bridgy Fed website, ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;You can use it to make your profile on one visible in another, follow people, see their posts, and reply and like and repost them. Interactions work in both directions as much as possible&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù. It‚Äôs easy to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a fediverse account? Bridge it to Bluesky by following &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.brid.gy/bsky.brid.gy&quot;&gt;@bsky.brid.gy@bsky.brid.gy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a Bluesky account? Bridge it to the fediverse by following &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/ap.brid.gy&quot;&gt;@ap.brid.gy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means you can live blissfully wherever you like but still participate in and connect with those who are on the other network. It‚Äôs easy to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-a-blog&quot;&gt;Start a blog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm an &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/indieweb&quot;&gt;IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt; enthusiast and &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/you-should-blog&quot;&gt;big proponent&lt;/a&gt; of everyone having their own website/blog. But what does that have to do with my choice of social media platform? It boils down to this. Social platforms rise and fall, and when they fall, so too does your account which has likely served as your identity for and on the web. By having a website (or a ‚Äúblog‚Äù), you can anchor your identity to your &lt;em&gt;domain name&lt;/em&gt; rather than some @twitter.com or @bsky.social or @whatever handle. Bluesky has actually realized this as something that is important and you are able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky&quot;&gt;register a domain name as your actual handle&lt;/a&gt; on the service. &lt;em&gt;Nice!&lt;/em&gt; But this only &lt;em&gt;kinda&lt;/em&gt; helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, people might now &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; me now as ‚Äúshellsharks.com‚Äù on Bluesky, but if I had no blog, and Bluesky were to go &lt;a href=&quot;#longevity-of-bluesky&quot;&gt;belly up&lt;/a&gt;, people wouldn‚Äôt be able to find me as I wouldn‚Äôt exist anywhere except on Bluesky. But since I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a website, people can continue to find me, connect with me, see what I have to say, etc‚Ä¶ by going to my domain. So sure. Use Bluesky if you want as your main social network. But go buy a domain, register it as your handle on Bluesky and then put &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; on that domain that resolves in a browser so people can find you now and into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xposting&quot;&gt;XPosting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of people suggest cross-posting to those who are thinking of ‚Äúmoving‚Äù to Bluesky. They‚Äôll say, ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Hey! instead of just posting to Bluesky, why don‚Äôt you post both places?&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù. I personally don‚Äôt like this. What I mean is that I think cross-posting comes with a lot of compromises, that for me, and I assume for so many others, doesn‚Äôt make it worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-posting requires using an app built with this functionality, the ability to sign into multiple platforms. This may just not be the app someone wants to use. Though I will say there are some good options, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openvibe.social&quot;&gt;Openvibe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://croissantapp.com&quot;&gt;Croissant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mszpro.com/sorasns/&quot;&gt;SoraSNS&lt;/a&gt;, etc‚Ä¶ Second, in my experience audiences are just, &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; on the different platforms. What you might say on one isn‚Äôt necessarily what you would say on the other. So just posting the exact same thing word-for-word across both might not really &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;. It can also be somewhat &lt;em&gt;impersonal&lt;/em&gt;. So now there is the mental overhead of tweaking posts across each or deciding when you want to x-post or not. Posting across multiple networks also means fielding replies across both. Again, more work. We all arguably spend too much time already on social media, just on one platform, much less trying to juggle communities and relationships across both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, maybe cross posting is something you can do, or would like to do. But I certainly wouldn‚Äôt fault you for not doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-starter-packs&quot;&gt;On Starter Packs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; popular feature of Bluesky is their &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs&quot;&gt;Starter Pack&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs basically a list of accounts you can give a name and people can peruse those lists, following individual accounts or clicking ‚ÄúFollow All‚Äù to follow everyone in the pack. It‚Äôs extremely easy to use, easy to create and at first glance, a great way to build your network and improve discoverability. Or so I thought‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past 72 hours I‚Äôve gone from like 200 followers to ~1.2k followers. I‚Äôm almost &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; this is because of my placement in a popular starter pack or two. &lt;em&gt;Awesome right&lt;/em&gt;? More people will see what I post and might respond to me. But has it worked out that way? Hard to say, and engagement is a tricky thing to scientifically evaluate, but I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs having that effect. What I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; is happening, and what I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I‚Äôve personally done, is just blindly follow everyone in a given pack with no real evaluation. I think this has a devaluing effect on my feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I‚Äôm just used to the highly curated aspect of my Fedi feed. But damnit if that feed on Mastodon isn‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; high fidelity. It should be right? I‚Äôve hand selected every account I follow through somewhat rigorous means. Not just willy-nilly following 80 people in one fell swoop. What happens is this, for lack of a better word, junks up the feed. I‚Äôm someone who likes to read through my timeline, see what everyone has said. But on Bluesky, thanks to the fact that timeline position, when refreshed, sends you to the top, and the effects of these starter packs, I find that my feed is just an unruly mess that I can‚Äôt stay on top of and as a result find less interesting. Then, frustrated with my ‚ÄúFollowing‚Äù feed, I‚Äôll check out the default algorithmic ‚ÄúDiscover‚Äù feed, which tends to just be memes and ‚Äúbig accounts‚Äù - &lt;em&gt;yawn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another set of pitfalls I see with starter packs is ongoing management and redundancies. In just a few short days I‚Äôve seen quite a few ‚ÄúInfosec‚Äù starter packs pop up. If you‚Äôre an infosec person, and you want to be featured in the pack, which do you choose? Which will be the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù ones? Who created the pack? Will they keep it up-to-date? Do you feel comfortable pinging someone asking to be included in a pack? Will it become a popularity contest? I don‚Äôt know how to answer or really analyze much of this at this point, but I just see potential issues. That said, I still think it‚Äôs a great idea and does make following a lot of accounts a lot easier. Generic packs like ‚Äúinfosec‚Äù might be hard to maintain and be extremely unruly (100‚Äôs of people) but smaller, more focused packs, e.g. writers at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/start/did:plc:cjfcz3t36f6nrprarkhkycxo/3laojwpjit62a&quot;&gt;404 Media&lt;/a&gt; are perfect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;threads&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre going to talk social media, it‚Äôs hard to ignore &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/introducing-threads-new-app-text-sharing/&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt;. Afterall, Threads still boasts over 200 million users and has 10‚Äôs of millions of daily active users (&lt;a href=&quot;https://explodingtopics.com/blog/threads-users&quot;&gt;src&lt;/a&gt;). Contrast that with &lt;a href=&quot;#bluesky&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; or Mastodon‚Äôs relatively paltry sub-20m total users each. But Threads is flagging. People are unhappy with the choices the leadership/development teams have continued to make around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266096/instagram-threads-moderation-account-post-deleted-limited&quot;&gt;algorithmic choices&lt;/a&gt; and more. I don‚Äôt use Threads much. I feel the same about Threads as I do Bluesky for the most part. If you like it there, and its where your ‚Äúpeople‚Äù are, then &lt;a href=&quot;#do-it&quot;&gt;be there&lt;/a&gt;. It has some of the same, and some different risks as Bluesky, but whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; wrinkle with Threads is the ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/21/networking-traffic/threads-has-entered-the-fediverse/&quot;&gt;implementation of ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, Threads users who decide to opt in to the ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.instagram.com/760878905943039&quot;&gt;Fediverse sharing&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù beta can enjoy a very half-baked, but not entirely useless form of federation that allows users on the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù fediverse to see and even reply to posts you make natively on Threads. Actually &lt;em&gt;kinda cool&lt;/em&gt;. You can‚Äôt yet follow native Fediverse users from Threads, but in theory that is coming in the not too distant future. I think if this ever does materialize, and does so in a non-compromising way, it will be a feature that gives those on Threads a real benefit over those on Bluesky. Afterally, the &lt;a href=&quot;#bridgy-fed&quot;&gt;Bridgy Fed&lt;/a&gt;, Bluesky &amp;lt;‚Äì&amp;gt; Fedi bridge is cool, but comes with plenty of compromises as it would compare to true Federation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The Future&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt see the future. Who knows what will happen. But there is a non-zero chance that &lt;a href=&quot;#bluesky&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; fails to truly &lt;a href=&quot;#is-bluesky-decentralized&quot;&gt;decentralize&lt;/a&gt;, and the main/centralized instance of the platform is forced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/&quot;&gt;enshittify&lt;/a&gt; in some disastrous way. Simultaneously, (in this same timeline) &lt;a href=&quot;#threads&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; has continued to decline in user experience thanks to an increasingly heavy-handed algorithm, inability to moderate spam accounts and overpopulation of corporate or advertising-related posts/accounts. Where do people go? Will they stay on those centralized platforms, accepting the compromises for what they are and muddle through? Will a new shiny platform pop up and people go there? What will it take for the ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://fediverse.info&quot;&gt;Fediverse&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù to get real traction? What features do we need? What cultural shift needs to happen? What big ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù accounts would need to set up shop here? I can‚Äôt say. I think improving discoverability by copying some of Bluesky‚Äôs popular features, namely &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.bsky.app/docs/starter-templates/custom-feeds&quot;&gt;custom feeds&lt;/a&gt; (opt-in algos) and &lt;a href=&quot;#on-starter-packs&quot;&gt;starter packs&lt;/a&gt; could really help. I also think improving the identity model, also similar to how Bluesky has done it by being &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial&quot;&gt;domain backed&lt;/a&gt;, could also help. Beyond that, moderation improvements and instance choice/onboarding could use a freshen-up to help people feel less intimidated by joining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exciting time to be sure!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>36 things</title>
        <shark:summary><p>A list of <strong>36</strong> assorted things‚Ä¶<sup>1</sup></p>
</shark:summary>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A list of &lt;strong&gt;36&lt;/strong&gt; assorted things‚Ä¶&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All sushi rolls taste the same to me. All good though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NBA Playoffs are the best professional sports playoffs format.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pokemon Crystal was the best pokemon game. Nintendo should have stopped making new Pokemon after Gen 2 and put effort into making better games, not more creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work + Going to the gym + Being a father + Podcasting + Blogging + Doing infosec training is HARD to pull off simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scrubs is the best comedy TV show of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm glad I steered my blogging topics into more personal things and not just professional / infosec writing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going from two kids to three kids changes A LOT logistically. I‚Äôm finding it harder to understand how people manage it. How do you fit them into a normal car? Now I need a bigger house. How do you put three kids to bed? The list goes on‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAI‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to work out. At least not the way AI proponents think. It isn‚Äôt going to be the revolution they think it will be. It just doesn‚Äôt work universally for all things the way they want it to. I‚Äôm not saying it doesn‚Äôt do &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; things very well, just that those usecases are more edgecases - things that the general population do not get value from.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm 36. The retirement age in the US is 67. I‚Äôve got 31 years left to work. That‚Äôs a loooong time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love to play basketball. Not sure how much longer I can continue to play competitive pick-up but I‚Äôm going to keep doing it until I can‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing on ‚ÄúAI‚Äù. I really dislike that ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù is in the name. There‚Äôs nothing intelligent (as it relates to human intelligence) about it. Look at the art it produces, the prose it generates - cold and artificial. Look at the mistakes it makes, its confabulations, inhuman and wholly unintelligent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not a hat person. Kinda wish I was.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Putting on weight, specifically muscle-weight is kinda hard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving off of Gmail takes a lot of effort. So much is tied to your email account over the years/decades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Masters diploma lives in a tube. Not sure what I should do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really quite liked season 1 of the Rings of Power TV show. Looking forward to season 2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish I had started a blog long before 2019. But I‚Äôm glad I got goin‚Äô with it when I did instead of putting it off even further.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started drinking coffee during the pandemic. I never &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; coffee before and was proud of that fact. Now I fear I‚Äôve developed an addiction I do not want to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I need to go hiking more. I look forward to the future when I can reliably bring my kids out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I started working out about a year and a half ago I‚Äôve drank A LOT less beer. I don‚Äôt miss it, and it‚Äôs had an impact on my wallet too!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any money I‚Äôve saved by drinking less alochol has been blown up by the amount of yogurt, milk, almond butter, frozen fruit, bananas and protein powder I‚Äôve consumed in my daily smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trackpad &amp;gt; Mouse&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know how people can sleep not on their back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of people lament the fall of Twitter. I think the death of Twitter has been an amazing catalyst for the open web and it is joyous.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have an old iMac that doesn‚Äôt support the latest versions of MacOS. Need to figure out something to do with it‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Saw my first Cybertruck the other day. Truly bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going to try to teach my son how to swim this summer. He‚Äôs 3. Will be fun!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder how long this 2019 Mac Pro will last me. I wonder how long Apple will support it with updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;11 days left in &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/04/30/weblogpomo-2024&quot;&gt;weblogpomo2024&lt;/a&gt;. Now it gets tough‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHVkLOmBWU8&quot;&gt;Golgotha Compendium: Fifth Temple&lt;/a&gt; is a great song.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seattle is my favorite US city I‚Äôve been to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advice: Get in shape before you‚Äôre in your 30‚Äôs and have kids / responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get a rice cooker. Game changer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go buy yourself a domain if you don‚Äôt have one. &lt;em&gt;Do it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I need to set up my Stream Deck (again).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impostor syndrome is unshakeable. So stop shaking, you‚Äôre in good company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://niclake.me/35/&quot;&gt;nic lake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/11/03/super-mario-wonder&quot;&gt;previous note&lt;/a&gt;, I grumped a bit about how low-stakes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://supermariobroswonder.nintendo.com/&quot;&gt;Super Mario Wonder&lt;/a&gt; plot is, specifically, how much of a nothing-burger Bowser‚Äôs actions were. So I decided to go back through the history of Mario games and list Bowser‚Äôs various crimes (attempted and successful) below‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Bros&lt;/strong&gt; - Invades Mushroom Kingdom, Kidnaps Princess Toadstool, transfigures the Toads&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Bros 2&lt;/strong&gt; - N/A. No mention of Bowser&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Land&lt;/strong&gt; - N/A. No mention of Bowser&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Bros 3&lt;/strong&gt; - Seeks to conquer Mushroom World, steals magical wands, transfigures toad kings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario World&lt;/strong&gt; - Invasion (of Dinosaur Land), kidnapping (Princess Toadstool of course)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario RPG&lt;/strong&gt; - Kidnaps Princess Peach (but redeems himself by joining forces with Mario to defeat Smithy &amp;amp; gang)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/strong&gt; - Kidnaps Peach, steals Power Stars&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Sunshine&lt;/strong&gt; - Lying (Bowser told Bowser Jr. that Peach is his mother so Bowser Jr. does crimes‚Ä¶)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Super Mario Bros&lt;/strong&gt; - N/A (only Bowser Jr. seems to appear)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/strong&gt; - Attacking with airships, stealing Power Stars, kidnapping Peach, wrecklessly creating unstable galaxies that seek to destroy Mario‚Äôs reality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Galaxy 2&lt;/strong&gt; - More attacking of the Peach‚Äôs castle, kidnapping Peach, Power Star theft, attacking spaceships&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario 3D Land&lt;/strong&gt; - Kidnaps Peach, steals Super Leaves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Super Mario Bros U&lt;/strong&gt; - Imprisons Peach, invasion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario 3D World&lt;/strong&gt; - Kidnaps Sprixie princesses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/strong&gt; - Kidnaps peach, attempts a forced marriage, destroys Marios hat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Wonder&lt;/strong&gt; - Partying too hard? (I guess he also steals the Wonder Flower and imprisons some flower people)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of kidnapping, turning people into things, theft, trying to conquer everything and of course general assault/battery. But with Wonder? I‚Äôm still not sure what he did. Bowser just trying to get his groove on‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Responding to &lt;a href=&quot;https://flamedfury.com/posts/nostalgia-music/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://flamedfury.com&quot;&gt;Flamed Fury&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to write about music that I found nostalgic or that I associate with certain memories. I‚Äôll attempt to write these in a chronological fashion as best as my memory will allow‚Ä¶ (&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;All music links are to Apple Music listings.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somewhere within my childhood&lt;/em&gt;: I have a lot of memory fragments of assorted music from my childhood, most of it stuff my dad really liked. e.g. Driving at night in the car listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/zombie/1440735255?i=1440735264&quot;&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-cranberries/122615&quot;&gt;The Cranberries&lt;/a&gt; or hearing my dad sing &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/photograph/1440902935?i=1440902940&quot;&gt;Photograph&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/def-leppard/117554&quot;&gt;Def Leppard&lt;/a&gt; and a number of songs by &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-goo-goo-dolls/147559&quot;&gt;The Goo Goo Dolls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;~&lt;strong&gt;1997&lt;/strong&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;2000&lt;/strong&gt;: I can‚Äôt pin down the exact year, but I remember listening to A LOT of &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/c%C3%A9line-dion/63729&quot;&gt;Celine Dion&lt;/a&gt; courtesy of my sister and the drives we had when she would drop me off at school when we lived in Jacksonville, FL. I remember she was in High School at the time. Specifically, I remember listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/its-all-coming-back-to-me-now/1473319237?i=1473319246&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs All Coming Back to Me Now&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/thats-the-way-it-is/479204871?i=479204974&quot;&gt;That‚Äôs The Way It Is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. Like, every single morning a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2000&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/hybrid-theory/528436018&quot;&gt;Hybrid Theory&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/linkin-park/148662&quot;&gt;Linkin Park&lt;/a&gt; is one of those rare albums where &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; song is good and I will listen to the entire album without skipping any of ‚Äòem. It has also stayed in my regular listening rotation for nearly 25 years now. When this album came out, it was &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; I listened to. If you had asked me what kinda music I liked back then, I would have just shown you the Hybrid Theory CD case. I honestly don‚Äôt think I really cared about music before this album came out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2000&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/infest/1450006102&quot;&gt;Infest&lt;/a&gt; album from &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/papa-roach/3445763&quot;&gt;Papa Roach&lt;/a&gt; is also a big one from my early music-listening days. I sang each of these songs endlessly. I remember convincing my grandma to buy it for me at some flea market in South Carolina and she being very concerned about the parental advisory warning üòÇ.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2001&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/blurry/1450664881?i=1450664888&quot;&gt;Blurry&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/puddle-of-mudd/109754&quot;&gt;Puddle of Mudd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/crawling-in-the-dark/1597017127?i=1597017128&quot;&gt;Crawling in the Dark&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hoobastank/415242&quot;&gt;Hoobastank&lt;/a&gt; were both mini-obsessions built on top of my love for Linkin Park.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2001&lt;/strong&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;2002&lt;/strong&gt;: My sister was &lt;em&gt;constantly&lt;/em&gt; singing both &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/complicated/315025768?i=315025823&quot;&gt;Complicated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/avril-lavigne/459885&quot;&gt;Avril&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/everywhere/301027659?i=301027748&quot;&gt;Everywhere&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/michelle-branch/1054040&quot;&gt;Michelle Branch&lt;/a&gt; when they came out. It‚Äôll always remind me of my parents house in Stafford and how it looked at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;~&lt;strong&gt;2002&lt;/strong&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;2004&lt;/strong&gt;: I can‚Äôt pin down exactly &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;, but I vividly remember the first time I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/stairway-to-heaven/580708175?i=580708180&quot;&gt;Stairway to Heaven&lt;/a&gt;. I was going through my dad‚Äôs collection of vinyl records and playing them on a turntable I had set up under my bunk bed. I must have replayed the song 5 or 6 times (maybe more) after that first listen. It was I think the exact moment where I pivoted into classic rock as a core musical preference.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;~&lt;strong&gt;2003&lt;/strong&gt;: In highschool I went through a BIG &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/afi/3447440&quot;&gt;AFI&lt;/a&gt; phase, and really loved the &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/sing-the-sorrow/1440796793&quot;&gt;Sing the Sorrow&lt;/a&gt; album that came out around my freshman year. (I also really enjoyed &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-art-of-drowning/1440942604&quot;&gt;The Art of Drowning&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/black-sails-in-the-sunset/1440940023&quot;&gt;Black Sails in the Sunset&lt;/a&gt;). It‚Äôll always make me think of that time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2003&lt;/strong&gt;: There were a few months that I think I &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; listened to the album &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/year-of-the-spider/1488013267&quot;&gt;Year Of The Spider&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cold/435825401&quot;&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, the songs &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/cure-my-tragedy/1488013267?i=1488013294&quot;&gt;Cure My Tragedy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/wasted-years/1488013267?i=1488013570&quot;&gt;Wasted Years&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-day-seattle-died/1488013267?i=1488013584&quot;&gt;The Day Seattle Died&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/black-sunday/1488013267?i=1488013586&quot;&gt;Black Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. Peaky teen angst type-uh stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2003&lt;/strong&gt;: A rendition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-favor-house-atlantic/365400149?i=365401285&quot;&gt;A Favor House Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; by a friend at lunch in high school introduced me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/coheed-and-cambria/15031628&quot;&gt;Coheed &amp;amp; Cambria&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/good-apollo-im-burning-star-iv-vol-1-from-fear-through/307654866&quot;&gt;Good Apollo I‚Äôm Burning Star IV&lt;/a&gt; came out 2 years later, I remember some friends playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/welcome-home/307654866?i=307654871&quot;&gt;Welcome Home&lt;/a&gt; on my stereo in the basement and was blown away. Will never forget. Still one of my favorite artists of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;~&lt;strong&gt;2003&lt;/strong&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;2006&lt;/strong&gt;: At some point in High School I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4OU6BUKo-A&quot;&gt;this YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; featuring &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/metallica/3996865&quot;&gt;Metallica‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; song &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/no-leaf-clover-live-with-the-sfso/579377398?i=579377477&quot;&gt;No Leaf Clover&lt;/a&gt;. I loved DBZ at the time and this song was just insanely good. I‚Äôll always associate the two.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;~&lt;strong&gt;2005&lt;/strong&gt;: I remember filming a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; silly cover of &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/soul-survivor-feat-akon/1440743075?i=1440743758&quot;&gt;Jeezy‚Äôs Soul Survivor&lt;/a&gt;, I dubbed it ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Bacon &amp;amp; Young Cheesy&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù where I was ‚ÄúBacon‚Äù and my brother was ‚ÄúYoung Cheesy‚Äù. I held a package of bacon in my hand while my brother waved around a frozen Stouffers Mac ‚Äòn cheese. It‚Äôs a shame I don‚Äôt remember the lyrics we came up with. &lt;em&gt;Silly silly stuff&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;~&lt;strong&gt;2005&lt;/strong&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;2006&lt;/strong&gt;: One summer in high school I worked at Kings Dominion. For some reason I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-beatles/136975&quot;&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt; album &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/abbey-road-remastered/1441164426&quot;&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/a&gt; every morning during that commute.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;~&lt;strong&gt;2006&lt;/strong&gt;+: I had not one, but &lt;em&gt;TWO&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/elvenking/80081895&quot;&gt;Elvenking&lt;/a&gt; CDs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-scythe/942655487&quot;&gt;The Scythe&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/heathenreel/943344490&quot;&gt;Heathenreel&lt;/a&gt;) I had burned in my Kia Sephia that I would listen to all the time. Whenever I would drive my friends anywhere they would joke that I was &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; listening to Elvenking. They expected me to play it too anytime they were in the car. I didn‚Äôt disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;~&lt;strong&gt;2006&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/into-the-ocean/1440778800?i=1440779255&quot;&gt;Into the Ocean&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/blue-october/559128&quot;&gt;Blue October&lt;/a&gt; always reminds me of an internship I had in DC where I commuted in with my dad. It was a frequent play on the radio during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;~&lt;strong&gt;2011&lt;/strong&gt;: The song &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/we-found-love-feat-calvin-harris/1440758930?i=1440758945&quot;&gt;We Found Love&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/rihanna/63346553&quot;&gt;Rihanna&lt;/a&gt; will always remind me of the first time I went to Mardi Gras. Though admittedly a lot of those memories are quite &lt;span style=&quot;color:#912A7E;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;hazy&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/closer-feat-halsey/1170699510?i=1170699703&quot;&gt;Closer&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-chainsmokers/580391756&quot;&gt;Chainsmokers&lt;/a&gt; always reminds me of my wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2019&lt;/strong&gt;: When me and my wife were in Prague, we heard a beautiful rendition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/many-shades-of-black/1552871264?i=1552871537&quot;&gt;Many Shades of Black&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-raconteurs/129477464&quot;&gt;The Raconteurs&lt;/a&gt;. I wish I had a recording.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2020&lt;/strong&gt;+: &lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt;. So in 2020 my son was born and as new parents we didn‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; have everything figured out. Putting this kid to sleep was of notable difficulty. In one such event, I was trying to get my son to sleep and walked him upstairs to the bathroom where my wife was showering. She was listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/34-35/1537486662?i=1537486672&quot;&gt;34+35&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ariana-grande/412778295&quot;&gt;Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;. Upon hearing the song, my son immediately calmed down. Desperate, I took that as a sign that he loved Ariana Grande. Turns out, I think I was onto something. From then on, we played the album (&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/album/positions/1537486662&quot;&gt;Positions&lt;/a&gt;) for him at every nap time and &lt;em&gt;magically&lt;/em&gt;, it really did put him to sleep or otherwise had a very calming effect. As a result, it will &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt; be in my top songs ever played because I had to listen to this full album 3x+ times a day for, and I am not kidding here, &lt;em&gt;YEARS&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I found an old note in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplenote.com&quot;&gt;Simplenote&lt;/a&gt; archive (&lt;em&gt;circa August 2020&lt;/em&gt;) titled ‚ÄúFavorite Songs‚Äù.

        <title>Crystal Six</title>
        <shark:summary><p>Though the original Pokemon (Blue/Red) game will forever hold a particularly special place in my heart, I think of Pokemon <strong><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok√©mon_Crystal_Version">Crystal</a></strong> as both my favorite and the <em>best</em> of the entire Pokemon series.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those follow poke-fans out there, you may notice that I still have a bit of a preference for Gen I, with 5 of the 6 having base forms that are from the original games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Ode to Lost Friends</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;They say time heals all, but time is also a void that severs and decays the bonds of friendship. With fondness and regret, I look back at a life dotted with friendships made, and those forgotten‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vzqk50.com/whoami/&quot;&gt;Apis Necros&lt;/a&gt; for inspiring me with their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vzqk50.com/blog/an-ode-to-lost-friends/&quot;&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt; on this subject.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;ph ph-butterfly&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;veronica&quot;&gt;‚ÄúVeronica‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In elementary school (I forget which grade exactly), we used to play kickball before class. One day, I got pegged in the face with the ball. It knocked the glasses off my face into the dirt and my nose bled. I cried and the kids laughed. ‚ÄúVeronica‚Äù (Her name definitely started with a ‚ÄúV‚Äù, but it could have been something else) instead picked up my glasses and asked me if I was OK. We weren‚Äôt ever friends, either before or after that day, but I‚Äôll always remember how she was nice to me in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-boys-in-black&quot;&gt;The ‚ÄúBoys in Black‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Way back in 4th/5th grade there was a group of maybe 3 of us who called ourselves the ‚ÄúBoys in Black‚Äù, i.e. ‚ÄúBiB‚Äù (inspired by the ‚ÄúMen in Black‚Äù movie). I don‚Äôt remember how we came up with this, or to what extent any one of us loved that movie so much that we‚Äôd name our group after it, but yeah. It‚Äôs funny too because thinking back, wearing black was not part of what we did at all. We would hold (daily?) meetings in class to discuss &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, but mostly we spent our time doodling ‚Äúbases‚Äù and fantastical weaponry / vehicles-of-war (e.g. jeeps, tanks, etc‚Ä¶). I suppose we liked (as many young boys/children probably do) the idea of having a secret base filled with cool gadgets and lasers. In that group, was another kid whos name I don‚Äôt remember, but I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; recall that his birthday was the day &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; mine. We used to observe that my birthday was the final day of Winter and his the first of Spring. That meant something to us. To the BiB!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leanna&quot;&gt;Leanna&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family and hers were incredibly close growing up, even into the later years of our childhood (i.e. highschool). We went on family trips, went camping, I even went to some highschool dances with her. Our parents would joke about us dating but we were always just friends. I still have vague memories of going to her family‚Äôs townhouse (in Lakeridge?) and hanging out in the basement with their dog Zelda and her two sisters (Victoria and Alexandra). In what is somewhat of a small-world-style twist, she ended up getting married to another past friend of mine from a separate circle (James, who I knew from Boy Scouts). I still think about the two of them and her family from time to time. I could probably reach out, but I never do. I hope they‚Äôre all doing great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amy&quot;&gt;Amy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy was, for a time, my best friend. In the days before the Internet took off, or cell phones were a thing, we would talk for HOURS on the phone, about anything, about whatever teenage kids in the 00‚Äôs had to talk about. One day, it just faded away and we stopped talking. I still don‚Äôt know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galileo&quot;&gt;Galileo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zak, Aaron, Johnson, Sean, my fellow 7th floor Galileo engineers at VT. For the better part of 4 years they were my friends, classmates and those I spent my days with. We had some good times and I suppose some not as good times. I sadly don‚Äôt talk to them anymore. I‚Äôve seen some occasional things on LinkedIn, in the days I bothered to go on LinkedIn and see what they were up to. It would be cool to catch up one day, see where their lives had taken them, meet their families, their kids. Ya never know‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kenny&quot;&gt;Kenny&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For nearly 5 years me and Kenny sat next to each other and did our best to stay busy. We worked at a large, well-known defense contractor. We were work friends and even had the rare meetup outside of work. Most memorable to me though is the weeks we spent painting/coloring/decorating these little troll figurines to look like various Marvel/DC super heros. Silly times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;destiny-1-raid-crew&quot;&gt;Destiny 1, Raid Crew&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh man did I love playing Destiny back in the day. I was a big time Halo addict back in the Halo 2/3 days and Destiny was no different. I played a lot of PVP via matchmaking but I also did a lot of raids (VoG anyone?) with a specific crew. We got along great and I remember they thought I was pretty funny. One day I just stopped playing and that was the end of an era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;destiny-2-stadia--the-salvations-clan&quot;&gt;Destiny 2, Stadia &amp;amp; the Salvations Clan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years after D1, Destiny 2 came to Stadia and I got really into the franchise once more. I played on ‚ÄúStadia‚Äù, Google‚Äôs game streaming platform and it was a really great experience, and also a very small (relatively speaking) community. We all seemed to generally know each other and get along, chatting amongst ourselves across a few Discord servers and Reddit subs. Eventually I joined the ‚ÄúSalvations‚Äù clan with my brother, someone who went by ‚ÄúPolitics‚Äù (who was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good) and a number of others. I also played with someone named ‚ÄúTime‚Äù who was very good with the bow. My ‚ÄúArbalest‚Äù skills were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDJBsc9SRvc&quot;&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; amongst the Stadia crew and boy did I have fun playing. Eventually life, family and other priorities became too much for me to afford the time needed to keep up with the game though. So much like what happened with D1, I pretty much vanished one day (and eventually Stadia too met its end.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pickup-ballers&quot;&gt;Pickup Ballers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I‚Äôve ran pickup bball with a number of different groups of guys. In each era, I‚Äôd play several times a week, for several hours each day. We came to know each other by name and we knew each others style of play. When I moved, or switched gyms, there were never any goodbyes. I just stopped going one day. In rare cases I would run into someone at wherever my new place that I would play, but generally, I just never saw them again. Another example, in a long string of examples of very situational friendships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoutout to the Courtland Towers crew - Paul, Leo, Eric, Steve K, Steve J, Derek and others whos names escape me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;ph ph-infinity&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stories aren‚Äôt particularly unique. Everyone has similar tales of friendships made and lost. It is just the nature of our shared experience as humans. I will admit that I am particularly bad at keeping in touch and surely what could have been longer-lasting relationships have suffered because of it. I also have a notoriously bad memory in terms of remembering anything from more than like 5 years ago, so there are likely countless other meaningful friendships that have been completely lost, even in memory. For those in my past, mentioned or not mentioned here that ever wanted to reach out, do it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ranking fry cuts</title>
        <shark:summary><p>French fries are great. <em>Duh!</em>. But how they are <em>cut</em> makes a big difference in how <em>great</em> they can be. Here‚Äôs how I would rank different fry cuts <em>1-10</em>:</p>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;French fries are great. &lt;em&gt;Duh!&lt;/em&gt;. But how they are &lt;em&gt;cut&lt;/em&gt; makes a big difference in how &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; they can be. Here‚Äôs how I would rank different fry cuts &lt;em&gt;1-10&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Waffle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Curly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tornado&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wedge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Steak&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shoestring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cottage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crinkle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Standard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;No matter the cut, a regular potato fry is vastly superior to a sweet potato fry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/01/29/thoughts-on-chips&quot;&gt;thoughts on chips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not a big April Fools person but in the spirit of silliness, here is a thought experiment / game to play‚Ä¶ 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My wife was listening to a podcast* which asked, ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;If you could (magically) make each finger on one hand produce a liquid, what 5 liquids would you choose&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù. My current list (and briefly why I chose it) below‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The five liquids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water&lt;/strong&gt; - the obvious one. life sustaining and versatile&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gold&lt;/strong&gt; - Printing $$ pretty much yeah?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein Smoothie&lt;/strong&gt; - Has just about everything in it I need. My smoothies consist of milk, greek yogurt, fruit, vegetables (&lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt;), almond butter &amp;amp; protein powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lava&lt;/strong&gt; - Self-defense. You wouldn‚Äôt mess with someone with a &lt;em&gt;lava finger&lt;/em&gt; would you?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gasoline&lt;/strong&gt; - Could be used for generator, fueling a &lt;a href=&quot;https://earthroamer.com&quot;&gt;sweet RV&lt;/a&gt;, tons of stuff‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering changing one to beer though‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: (not sure what the podcast was)&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stefanbohacek.online/@stefan&quot;&gt;@stefan&lt;/a&gt; Oh man, the ‚ÄúNothing to put there‚Äù crowd hits home. That and the much-related (but not listed here) ‚Äúno one will care what I have to say / no one will read‚Äù crowd. To anyone who matches these descriptions or has these feelings, know that you‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. absolutely have something to say, and a blog is a great place to say it, and..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. The Internet is a huge place. People &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; find your site and read it, no matter how niche it is, or how poorly designed, or how seemingly poorly written. There‚Äôs no thought you could have that couldn‚Äôt educate someone else out there and nothing you could write about that there isn‚Äôt some community out there that would have similar thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the other reasons folks don‚Äôt have a site‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; (and some other platforms) is 100% free (so if expense is an issue then it doesn‚Äôt need to be)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/indieweb#hosting&quot;&gt;more hosting providers&lt;/a&gt; than ever these days, many of which make it dead simple to get started, so don‚Äôt let complexity be a stopping point. You can always start real simple and get more complex as you go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time may be the biggest hurdle. I would just say that a blog isn‚Äôt something you need to maintain or publish regularly. Just put something up and post when you have time. Posts can be short, they can be sloppy, they can be whatever, Since you own the site, you can always edit something poorly written later too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For everything else, you could check out my post about ‚ÄúWhy I Blog. You Should Too!‚Äù for other advice/inspiration. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to üåô Shark after Dark üåô ‚Äì&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.social/@afterdark&quot;&gt;@afterdark@shellsharks.social&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This account features less-than-stellar and likely reality-detached toots, e.g. infosec meta-commentary, technology rants, life quibbles, w/e.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It serves as an (experimental) alt account for &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@shellsharks&quot;&gt;@shellsharks&lt;/a&gt; as part of my ‚Äúsocial horcrux‚Äù lifestyle. If you follow me over there, this account should be familiar, albeit slightly more unhinged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want a li‚Äôl more Shellsharks in your feed, sub away! ü¶à ü¶à&lt;/p&gt;

        <shark:summary><p>The site has gone through some notably major visual/aesthetic revisions since it was first established in 2019.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Jumping in on the chips thought-train &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lynnandtonicblog.com/2024/01/25/my-quick-thoughts-on-chips/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://snook.ca/archives/personal/quicker-thoughts-on-chips&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmullen.com/posts/more-quick-thoughts-on-chips/&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: Hot takes ahead‚Ä¶)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tortilla chips are top tier when served with a spicy salsa or &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; queso. Eating them plain is acceptable if you don‚Äôt have anything proper to dip them into. Unranked list of top brands include &lt;em&gt;Xochitl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tostitos&lt;/em&gt; and those thick kinda oily tortilla chips you find in unbranded paper bags at Whole Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Potato chips should be kettle-cooked &lt;em&gt;above all else&lt;/em&gt;. Those awful varieties of thin flimsy potato chip should be discarded. This &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; include Pringles, which are hardly even chips tbh. (&lt;em&gt;More on this further down.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Potato chip top-5 flavor rankings:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Jalape√±o&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Barbeque&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Plain&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sour cream &amp;amp; onion&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Salt &amp;amp; vinegar
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First couple Doritos taste good, beyond that you realize they are a trash food.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sour cream and onion dip should be enjoyed with thick, wavy (plain) potato chips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúClassic‚Äù Lay‚Äôs Potato Chips are awful. &lt;em&gt;Please don‚Äôt eat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven‚Äôt eaten a ‚Äúcorn chip‚Äù of any kind since I was a child. This seems appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of my childhood it was impossible for me &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to eat an entire bag of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andycapps.com&quot;&gt;Andy Capp‚Äôs Hot Fries&lt;/a&gt; in one sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Of course pretzels, Cheetos and other varieties of cheese puffs are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; chips. But if you‚Äôre going to eat a pretzel, it should probably just be chocolate or yogurt-dipped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>On supporting 404 Media and what&apos;s important</title>
        <shark:summary><p>I‚Äôve been following <a href="https://mastodon.social/@404mediaco">@404mediaco</a> since they went live last year and this most <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jasonkoebler/111823811997186188">recent post</a> from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jasonkoebler/111823811997186188">@jasonkoebler</a> and the team there <em>really got me thinking</em>. (That toot links to <a href="https://www.404media.co/why-404-media-needs-your-email-address/">https://www.404media.co/why-404-media-needs-your-email-address/</a>).</p>
</shark:summary>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been following &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@404mediaco&quot;&gt;@404mediaco&lt;/a&gt; since they went live last year and this most &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@jasonkoebler/111823811997186188&quot;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@jasonkoebler/111823811997186188&quot;&gt;@jasonkoebler&lt;/a&gt; and the team there &lt;em&gt;really got me thinking&lt;/em&gt;. (That toot links to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/why-404-media-needs-your-email-address/&quot;&gt;https://www.404media.co/why-404-media-needs-your-email-address/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They‚Äôve had some incredible stories and scoops over the last couple months. I see all the headlines come through Mastodon or RSS and I say ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs crazy‚Äù, or ‚Äúdang, I never knew that‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt always translate into me fully reading the post. Maybe I don‚Äôt have time to read it, maybe I mean to but then forget, in other cases I think the story is interesting but doesn‚Äôt necessarily impact me specifically. But these stories are meant to be read, they &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be read, maybe not by me all the time, but by someone‚Ä¶ in reality, A LOT of someones if you ask me. Everything they call out in terms of rampaging AI theft, social network decay, traditional journalism in freefall, etc‚Ä¶ is no joke. I‚Äôm seeing it happen each day and it is in fact quite troubling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôve always relied on the free-ness of stuff on the web and as a result have been somewhat reluctant to choose creators/publications to support. But given the state of the web, HELL, the state of the &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt;, I really can‚Äôt justify that any more. I want to see more of what 404 produces, and to help ensure that, I plan to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/faq/&quot;&gt;support that end&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôve also been working on a list of other causes, publications, etc‚Ä¶ to support as this I feel is an ever precarious point in time. (If you have any suggestions I would be interested in hearing what you believe could use the support - comment or DM me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what‚Äôs my point? I suppose it‚Äôs support what you like, what‚Äôs impactful, what‚Äôs important to not just you but to everyone, otherwise it may vanish. The world has changed and I need to as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welp!&lt;/em&gt; That‚Äôs a wrap on &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/11/01/nablopomo-2023&quot;&gt;NaBloPoMo 2023&lt;/a&gt;. To sum it all up, the experience was certainly challenging but also a great way for me to write about a variety of different topics. Here‚Äô some other mini-takeaways from the past 30 days‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I definitely lost some steam towards the end of the month. Blame writing fatigue, the holidays, busier family schedule, or whatever - it was evident I just didn‚Äôt have the energy towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were a few residual topics I had planned to write about that I never got around to. These will make for great posts in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For NaBloPoMo 2024, I need to be prepared to get ahead of my writing in the earlier days of the month to mitigate fatigue experienced later in the month as well as having less time due to the start of the holiday season (i.e. Thanksgiving).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt come close to the &lt;em&gt;50k&lt;/em&gt; word goal, even falling short of &lt;em&gt;20k&lt;/em&gt;. I also didn‚Äôt quite get to a post-a-day. But I‚Äôm happy with what I was able to produce and look forward to next year!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to anyone who took the time to read any of this months stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to spend my time off</title>
        <shark:summary><p>I‚Äôve got ~4 months of leave coming up and am mentally lining up how I would like to spend it and what (if anything) I could attempt to <em>accomplish</em> given I have the time. Here‚Äôs what I got‚Ä¶</p>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve got ~4 months of leave coming up and am mentally lining up how I would like to spend it and what (if anything) I could attempt to &lt;em&gt;accomplish&lt;/em&gt; given I have the time. Here‚Äôs what I got‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bonding with my daughter (&lt;em&gt;this is of course the primary objective for parental leave&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Podcast reboot - &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/podcast&quot;&gt;The Shellsharks Podcast&lt;/a&gt; is coming back! Thinking of how I want to structure this next season.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cooking - There‚Äôs a few things I would like to learn to cook‚Ä¶
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Home-made pasta sauce &amp;amp; pasta (noodles)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Some sort of delicous bean soup&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tweak my chili recipe
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blog/Site upgrades - I have a number of things &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/roadmap&quot;&gt;I‚Äôd like to add&lt;/a&gt; to the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWork 2.0‚Äù - Basically, I want to put some thought into a bunch of things related to my career and money-making in general. How can I monetize my side projects (i.e. podcast, blog, etc‚Ä¶), what do I want to do work-wise in the next 1, 3, 5, even 10 years? This sort of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gaming - I have recently started to get back into gaming a bit. Here‚Äôs some things I‚Äôm thinking about playing over the break‚Ä¶
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/11/22/retro-gaming-with-delta#title&quot;&gt;the ‚Äúclassics‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. some NES / SNES / N64 titles that I love&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;(old-school) Ultima Online (&lt;em&gt;w/ friends&lt;/em&gt;)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basketball - I plan on taking my talents to a different gym to play bball now that Lifetime has gone ‚Äúfull pickleball‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weight-lifting - &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/11/11/fitness-quest&quot;&gt;I‚Äôve been lifting since October&lt;/a&gt; of last year and want to keep up the pace!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cleaning the house - My wife &lt;em&gt;insisted&lt;/em&gt; I put this on the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Retro gaming with Delta</title>
        <shark:summary><div class="containbox">Update: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">Delta</a> is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/17/riley-testut-launches-delta-game-emulator-on-app-store-for-everyone-altstore-marketplace-for-eu/">now available</a> natively on iOS/iPadOS!</div>
<p><br /></p>
</shark:summary>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;containbox&quot;&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688&quot;&gt;Delta&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/17/riley-testut-launches-delta-game-emulator-on-app-store-for-everyone-altstore-marketplace-for-eu/&quot;&gt;now available&lt;/a&gt; natively on iOS/iPadOS!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always considered myself a ‚Äúgamer‚Äù. But I like to think there are (&lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt;) two types of ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù gamers - those that play alot but only a few titles and those that like to play alot and play &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. I‚Äôm more the &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt;. I grew up in the 90‚Äôs, so my love for gaming is shaped by consoles like the classic Nintendo, Super Nintendo, N64 and GameCube (I was &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; a Nintendo kid). I‚Äôve documented some of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2011/07/07/favorite-nintendo-games&quot;&gt;favorite titles here&lt;/a&gt;. In those days, I actually played quite a few different games. Starting with the GameCube, I became much more of a mono-player, in other words, I really just played one game on whatever was the latest console. With the GameCube I literally &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; played Super Smash, on Xbox it was Halo, with Xbox 360 more Halo and on Xbox One it was Destiny. (Somewhere in there I played a fair bit of Star Wars: Battlefront). As much as I miss the early days of Halo, LAN parties and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Noob_Combo&quot;&gt;plasma pistol + battle rifle combo&lt;/a&gt;, nothing comes quite as close to the ‚Äúgolden days‚Äù of gaming nostalgia as playing those NES/SNES/N64 games. Though I will never be able to recapture what it felt like to be a kid with no other responsibilities playing games with my brother early on a weekend morning, I still love to play these old games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have kept the consoles and games from my youth and &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; actually played them pretty recently (especially during the early days of the pandemic) and they‚Äôve worked great! One issue with that experience is that playing classic games on modern high-definition TVs makes for a bit of an eye sore. It also isn‚Äôt the most portable experience. Enter emulators. I‚Äôve played retro games on emulators for a long time now but there‚Äôs never been a great option for iOS outside of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Jailbreak&quot;&gt;jailbreak&lt;/a&gt; scene. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://deltaemulatorapp.com&quot;&gt;Delta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an emulator from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rileytestut&quot;&gt;Riley Testut&lt;/a&gt; (of former &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gba4iosapp.com&quot;&gt;GBA4iOS&lt;/a&gt; fame) that I‚Äôve recently installed on my iPad so that I can once again enjoy these classic titles! Installing it is &lt;em&gt;fairly&lt;/em&gt; straight forward and a really quick operation. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://faq.altstore.io&quot;&gt;instructions can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. It requires sideloading the app through an alternative app store, &lt;a href=&quot;https://altstore.io&quot;&gt;AltStore&lt;/a&gt;. AltStore has some other interesting apps that I will be interested in checking out in the future. Also interesting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Building_a_Trusted_Ecosystem_for_Millions_of_Apps_A_Threat_Analysis_of_Sideloading.pdf&quot;&gt;given Apples historical stance&lt;/a&gt;, is recent news around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/12/23957560/sideloading-and-other-changes-are-coming-to-ios-in-the-eu-soon&quot;&gt;Apple allowing sideloading&lt;/a&gt; in a near-future iOS release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once installed, Delta is easy enough to navigate - mostly, you just need to import your roms. There is some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/10/in-defense-of-roms-a-solution-to-dying-games-and-broken-copyright-laws/&quot;&gt;nuanced legality&lt;/a&gt; to how you acquire these roms and though there is not much history of enforcement, you should be conscious of how/what you are downloading. Also be careful of rom sites as they have been known to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vintageisthenewold.com/game-pedia/can-game-roms-have-virus&quot;&gt;distribute compromised files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing games is a great experience on iPad. Resizable window(s) (&lt;em&gt;using stage manager&lt;/em&gt;), external controller support, save states, game library, etc‚Ä¶ All right on your iPad. &lt;em&gt;Amazing&lt;/em&gt;! So far, I‚Äôve done a full 100% play through of Super Mario World (the GOAT Mario game) and have started a replay of Super Mario RPG (which Nintendo just dropped the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-mario-rpg-switch/&quot;&gt;redux&lt;/a&gt; of). I think for now I‚Äôll finish another playthrough of the classic and then pick up the new version sometime in the future, especially if they add a hard mode or new gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you‚Äôre looking to do some retro gaming, check out Delta for iOS/iPadOS!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Though I consider myself &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;, I also am relatively active on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt;. One thing I see quite often are people with quick takes on how Mastodon ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@guillecummings/post/CzIIcSLLhxE/&quot;&gt;sucks&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù and no one cares about ‚Äúfederation‚Äù.

&lt;h1 id=&quot;activitypub-the-fediverse-and-why-you-should-care&quot;&gt;ActivityPub, the Fediverse and Why You Should Care&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://activitypub.rocks&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; (‚ÄúAP‚Äù) support is coming to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/CuRtcYTNY3J/&quot;&gt;said by the head of Instagram himself&lt;/a&gt;. With AP in place, Threads can then become part of the ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse&quot;&gt;Fediverse&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù, which can be thought of as the larger network of interconnected platforms that can communicate with one another using AP as the underlying protocol. So how does Threads and its users benefit from joining the Fediverse? I‚Äôll explain by desribing the &lt;em&gt;interoperability&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;portability&lt;/em&gt; benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoperability&lt;/strong&gt;: All other platforms that are on the Fediverse can interact with each other using AP. Mastodon has traditionally been the largest AP-enabled platform but what else is part of the Fediverse? Here‚Äôs a &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/c/software/&quot;&gt;list of AP-enabled platforms&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, this list is mostly represented by small projects but more recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; has brought their &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/&quot;&gt;AP plugin&lt;/a&gt; online which allows WordPress sites to federate and therefore be followable by any other account on the Fediverse. This is &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; as WordPress makes up &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/go/website-building/wordpress-turns-18-and-powers-over-40-of-the-web/&quot;&gt;~40+% of the entire Internet&lt;/a&gt;. Now you can follow &lt;em&gt;websites&lt;/em&gt; directly from your Threads account and/or use your WordPress site as an identity/account for social media, also within the Fediverse. &lt;em&gt;Amazing&lt;/em&gt;! Now imagine other large platforms (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/21/tumblr-to-add-support-for-activitypub-the-social-protocol-powering-mastodon-and-other-apps/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/28/flipboard-joins-the-fediverse-with-a-mastodon-integration-and-community-plans-for-activitypub/&quot;&gt;Flipboard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.medium.com/medium-embraces-mastodon-19dcb873eb11&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-social-mastodon-private-beta-announcement/&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;) implementing AP support and what that could mean for you as a Threads user and for the Internet as a whole? Imagine instead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@quillmatiq/post/Cx_OCt0v0B7/&quot;&gt;sharing a screenshot&lt;/a&gt; or link to a website or other social media platform post you could natively share it directly on whatever platform you were on!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portability&lt;/strong&gt;: When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/x-twitter-rebrand-dead/&quot;&gt;Twitter crumbled&lt;/a&gt;, people were at a loss. Stay, despite the descension into a hellsite? Or leave, abandoning your followers and having no real place to set up shop next? A number of other platforms gained traction at that time, Threads, Mastodon, BlueSky, etc‚Ä¶ but for each of them you now had the task of rebuilding your following and making a new network. For some, having an existing Instagram graph helped bootstrap their Threads following, but for many, they were at 0 once again. With AP support, you would in theory be able to pick up your account from Threads and port it over to another platform completely (like Mastodon), your followers would come with you keeping your graph and identity intact. This adds a resilience not accessible with traditional centralized platforms and helps mitigate other issues like deplatforming.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Threads adopting ActivityPub and amassing the larget user-base of the Fediverse could cement them as the eternal dominant player in the social space. That said, if the platform were to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/23/01/the-enshittification-lifecycle-of-online-platforms&quot;&gt;enshittify&lt;/a&gt; for all the reasons these services typically do, users would not be stranded. &lt;em&gt;Great&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are probably the two biggest features AP offers to Threads users, but other benefits exist too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-mastodon--fediverse-is-good&quot;&gt;Why Mastodon / Fediverse is good&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me address the other comment I‚Äôve seen on Threads quite a bit - that Mastodon ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@guillecummings/post/CzIIcSLLhxE/&quot;&gt;sucks&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù or is just for weird anarchists, furries or techies. The uncorporate and privacy-concious qualities of Mastodon &lt;em&gt;DO&lt;/em&gt; make it a nice place for these communities, but these same characteristics and other benefits &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; make it a nice place for really &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a list of benefits of an open and decentralized network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow-fueled, chronological timeline. Tired of seeing certain types of content thrust into your feed? Worry no more! Mastodon does not rely on an algorithmic timeline. You see only what you follow and what your follows boost. If your interested in an algorithmic feed, some Mastodon clients are starting to build this functionaity into their apps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mastodon has no ads and there is no one trying to monetize your existence and use of the platform.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The anti-viral nature of an algorithm-less timeline means no (&lt;em&gt;or less&lt;/em&gt;) rage/engagement-baiting for the sake of driving platform engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Similarly, the lack of an algorithm driving what appears in the timeline means no opportunity for algorithmic-downranking of posts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did I mention that you aren‚Äôt monetized? You are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the product.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No influencers or brands clogging up your timeline. That said, you‚Äôre free to follow either if you choose!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything from your Mastodon instance (server) to the client you use is customizable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are third-party apps/clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are so inclined, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/own-my-social&quot;&gt;self-host&lt;/a&gt; your own Mastodon instance! This is a great way to prove the authenticity of your account, to improve ‚Äúbranding‚Äù and a great vanity piece.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have more control over data ownership.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs open source! The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/glitch-soc&quot;&gt;glitch-soc&lt;/a&gt; fork offers a number of improvements to the out-of-the-box Mastodon experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mastodon is by nature, ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù. This adds resilience and more to the network.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contextual, community-run moderation. On Threads, you rely on Facebook‚Äôs one-size-fits-all moderation approach. With Mastodon, each instance performs their own moderation so you get a much more custom, tailored approach to moderation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deplatforming/censorship resistance. Since you can move accounts and host your own federated instance, you can make yourself extremely resilient in the face of possible deplatforming/censorship.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Fediverse has by far the most interoperability with other networks. You can interface with the entire universe of AP-compatible networks while also engaging with those on Bluesky, Threads, Nostr and more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mastodon isn‚Äôt owned by Facebook*, a billionaire or any one person‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mastodon-isnt-perfect&quot;&gt;Mastodon isn‚Äôt perfect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve really enjoyed my time on Mastodon thus far, but it isn‚Äôt without some downsides‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mastodon is a network of disparate hosted instances. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedipact.veganism.social&quot;&gt;Drama&lt;/a&gt; often descends upon the Mastodon meta and instance admins are faced with decisions on whether to defederate from other instances.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Account migration exists but needs a tune up. It‚Äôs not entirely intuitive and does not port follows or historical posts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For users on smaller instances, reachability has technical challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discoverability is hard &lt;em&gt;at first&lt;/em&gt;. With no algorithm to speed along finding interesting accounts, some word is required to find who you want to follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you choose Mastodon or Threads shouldn‚Äôt matter much in a future world where both leverage AP, just choose whichever you feel comfortable with. If you‚Äôre on Threads and you love it that‚Äôs great! As a Threads user, you should be excited about an AP-enabled Threads future and should continue to advocate to Threads devs to implement this. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been over a year since I began a more committed fitness ‚Äújourney‚Äù. Here I reflect and share some thoughts on &lt;a href=&quot;#my-background&quot;&gt;where I started&lt;/a&gt;, what &lt;a href=&quot;#my-plan&quot;&gt;my plan&lt;/a&gt; has been, &lt;a href=&quot;#how-its-going&quot;&gt;how it‚Äôs been going&lt;/a&gt; and what my ultimate &lt;a href=&quot;#my-goals&quot;&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt; are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-background&quot;&gt;My Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always been pretty lean, at certain points some might even say ‚Äúscrawny‚Äù. In highschool I was 6‚Äô2‚Äù and around 140 pounds. When I set off for college I was closer to 160 and after 4 long years (of ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;intense studying&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù üòú) I began my post-university life at around 180. For years (like‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;10 years&lt;/em&gt;) I stayed in the 180-190 range, and then‚Ä¶ the pandemic hit. I stopped going to the gym (where I played &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of basketball) and my diet went from bad to worse. Things definitely started to get away from me and I did virtually nothing to backfill the activity I had lost. I knew I was getting out of shape but having never weighed myself or really tried to do much intense physical activity, it was hard to tell how bad it had gotten. It wasn‚Äôt until I was at my grandmas house one day, she had a scale and I weighed myself and I realized something needed to change. I clocked in at &lt;strong&gt;210 pounds&lt;/strong&gt; (some 20-30 lbs heavier than usual), the first time I had ever been over 200 and obviously the heaviest I had ever been, &lt;em&gt;and I felt it&lt;/em&gt;. This was the turning point for me. It wasn‚Äôt long after that that I signed up for the gym again and not only restarted playing basketball but also committed to lifting weights for the first time in my life. I had &lt;a href=&quot;#my-plan&quot;&gt;a plan&lt;/a&gt;, or something that resembled a plan and I was serious about losing weight and more importantly, getting stronger and in better shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-plan&quot;&gt;My Plan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what was the plan? Pretty simple actually, albeit somewhat unspecific - eat better, lift weights at the gym 5-6 times a week, add in supplemental home workouts/exercises when appropriate and get back to playing basketball. The problem? I knew nothing about lifting weights and hadn‚Äôt a clue about how and what to eat to both lose weight while putting on muscle. Some learning and research was required‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about gym equipment and how to put together workout sets, I signed up for a personal trainer at my gym (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lifetime.life&quot;&gt;Lifetime Fitness&lt;/a&gt;). I did a few sessions and learned the basics - proper form, how to use the machines, how to work different muscle groups, monitoring my heart rate and more! After that, I started putting together my own &lt;a href=&quot;#training-splits&quot;&gt;training splits&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoyed working with the trainer and wouldn‚Äôt mind continuing, but it &lt;em&gt;is expensive&lt;/em&gt; and for me, I think I can put together my own plan after learning the basics. If I find in the future I am plateau-ing or otherwise looking to accelerate my progression, I may grab a few more sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For diet, I learned (both from my trainer and through some online research) that I needed to hit a certain protein threshold to gain muscle - approximately 1g of protein per pound based on my &lt;em&gt;goal&lt;/em&gt; weight. Beyond that, I needed to simply monitor calories - calorie deficit to lose weight and surplus to put on weight. My trainer suggested I use a protein powder supplement (namely, Lifetime brand &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.lifetime.life/collagen-peptides&quot;&gt;collagen peptides&lt;/a&gt;) to hit my daily protein number. I hadn‚Äôt heard of and wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what ‚Äúcollagen peptides‚Äù were but I‚Äôve been using it for over a year now and love it. The vanilla flavor tastes great in smoothies, is less heavy than traditional whey, and has good benefits for digestion, hair, skin, etc‚Ä¶ To help me more accurately hit my macro numbers (protein but also general calories) each day I use a calorie tracker app on my phone. At first I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myfitnesspal.com&quot;&gt;MyFitnessPal&lt;/a&gt; and even paid for the subscription. The paid version gives you access to the barcode scanning feature which is important for quick adds to the app. More recently, I discovered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foodnoms.com&quot;&gt;FoodNoms&lt;/a&gt; app which is very similar to MyFitnessPal and has the barcode scanning feature in the free tier. I canceled MyFitnessPal and now use FoodNoms. FoodNoms has a more attractive interface in my opinion but its catalog of foods is poor compared to MyFitnessPal. Fortunately, I can supplement FoodNoms lack of catalog with MyFitnessPal‚Äôs as it is offered for free. I am off and on with diligently tracking macros/calories. I think a calorie tracker is indispensible in the early days of a fitness journey as you need to learn more about what foods have what in them, how much to eat, etc‚Ä¶ Later, once you‚Äôre in more of a routine and have a decent idea of what you‚Äôre putting into your body you can lay off more diligent tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started my personal training sessions and actually lifting weights I was over 200 pounds (202 to be exact-ish) and at just over 20% body fat. So &lt;a href=&quot;#how-its-going&quot;&gt;how‚Äôs it been going&lt;/a&gt; since then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-its-going&quot;&gt;How it‚Äôs going&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been just over a year since I first started lifting weights and eating better, my ‚Äúfitness journey‚Äù if you will. Overall, it‚Äôs going great! Some minor setbacks here and there but for the most part, I have been sticking with it and seeing results. Due to my current family life and work situation, I tend to go to the gym late, like 8pm+. I don‚Äôt mind this as I am usually up late anyways, tend to have a good amount of energy, even at that time, and being there late gives me the ability to take my time with the workout versus an early morning or lunch-time workout where I would feel rushed to get back to work. The gym tends to be less crowded at this time too which is a plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until recently, when at the gym I had my pick between lifting weights or playing pickup basketball and many a night, doing both. This was until Lifetime made the horrific decision to close &lt;em&gt;BOTH&lt;/em&gt; of their basketball courts in favor of installing pickleball courts (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mocoshow.com/2022/08/17/life-time-gaithersburg-to-convert-one-basketball-court-to-pickleball-courts/&quot;&gt;one such example&lt;/a&gt;). My rage at this decision can not be described using words of human tongue, &lt;em&gt;so I won‚Äôt try&lt;/em&gt;. I‚Äôll just say, &lt;em&gt;I don‚Äôt get it&lt;/em&gt;, and I‚Äôm sad that I can no longer play basketball at the gym and now need to find a new place to play, which means likely having to find a new gym altogether. It‚Äôs been a few weeks since I‚Äôve played basketball and not only can I feel the effects, I just miss playing. The cardio is important for my fitness but I also get an emotional release from playing so I need to find that again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My day-to-day &lt;a href=&quot;#training-splits&quot;&gt;training splits&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/08/08/current-training-splits&quot;&gt;evolved over time&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôve added, subbed and removed exercises to build a mildly efficient but seemingly effective workout routine to help me net the gains I am looking for. I‚Äôm still no expert by any means and am always looking to learn and tweak the regimen. I actually get a lot of ideas for what to add to my routine through fitness ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of ‚Äúgetting in shape‚Äù, or losing weight is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; lifting weights/working out, it‚Äôs not even achieving the consistency of exercising every day. The hardest part is eating right. For me (and many others) exercise is &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;! There is a chemical release associated with exercise and a primal satisfaction from using your body, the muscles, to do &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt;. What &lt;em&gt;isn‚Äôt&lt;/em&gt; fun is eating healthy - &lt;em&gt;hah&lt;/em&gt;! Eating right means focusing on healthier foods which means less sugar, less carbs and less fats (&lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; generally speaking). Thus, eating healthier means sacrificing at times, related to eating foods you may prefer taste-wise. What makes eating right a lot of work is the planning and prepping, plus the constant vigilance in not straying too far from the plan week in and week out. I‚Äôve &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; really eaten healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always been lean, always &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; active and my metabolism is maybe just good or something. Whatever this combination has been, it has let me compensate for the fact that I have never had a particularly healthy diet. To my credit, there are certain things I was always good at staying away from (i.e. soda), but I ate a lot of sweets, fried foods, drank a lot of beer, etc‚Ä¶ Well once the pandemic came through, my diet stayed the same (or even got worse) but my exercise fell off a cliff. During this period of time where I‚Äôve been looking to get in better shape I haven‚Äôt done a crazy amount of meal planning. There have been some weeks where I looked up ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù or otherwise protein-heavy meals and made them but for the most part I‚Äôve stuck with a few reliable dishes, making them again and again. Notably, a gym rat‚Äôs go-to, chicken + rice + vegetables of some kind. Outside of chicken and rice, I tend to just focus on meals that are high-protein, even if they aren‚Äôt particularly low calorie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I‚Äôve been more focused on putting on muscle rather than dropping pounds. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever tried to go through a ‚Äúbulking‚Äù phase, but rather just not caring whether I gain or lose weight at this point. That said, with my beach trip coming up I know I‚Äôm going to want to go through a cut just to lose as much of the unwanted belly fat as I can. This is a problem for future Mike at this point =). Steak is one thing I &lt;em&gt;haven‚Äôt&lt;/em&gt; had much of in the last year or so but that I have been planning on adding as a (probably weekly) part of my diet. It‚Äôs delicious and of course high protein. Though it‚Äôd be great if I had a bunch of diverse, delicious, healthy, protein-packed recipes/meals at my disposal, I‚Äôm happy with the fact that I can eat the same thing every day and not really get sick of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what challenges have I faced? Despite the fact that I‚Äôve had a second baby in this time, I‚Äôve been fortunate to have the time (and energy/motivation) to continue going to the gym at night. I‚Äôve seen decent results, even if not the most accelerated gains and this has helped continue to motivate me with respect to &lt;em&gt;consistently&lt;/em&gt; going. The biggest set backs have been illness (which I will admit isn‚Äôt overly frequent, but &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; unavoidable thanks to having one kid in daycare) and diet flubs (i.e. sweets, alcohol, etc‚Ä¶). Look, I don‚Äôt police myself too hard on diet and I allow myself to have the things that I like, but I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; feel guilty when I have a beer these days. It‚Äôs just not something I really crave any more and I set myself back unnecessarily by having the lapse in discipline. When I go out with friends or to a restaurant with my wife, I like to have a drink, but do I really need one when just at the house? I need to master saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to myself. My forthcoming challenge? Holiday season. This means delicious treats, cold weather keeping me inside and my favorite kinds of beers (i.e. heavier, sweeter stouts and the like). This combination of ‚Äúunhealthier‚Äù foods coupled with not wanting to go outside to get my normal daily cardio might be a source of setback so I need to be vigilant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;measuring-progress&quot;&gt;Measuring Progress&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can I measure progress? I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve done a great job tracking this and I really wish I had done some more measurements or even a picture of myself when I first started the ‚Äújourney‚Äù. I do have some rough numbers to go by in terms of measuring my progress though and more qualitatively I can see physical/visual changes in my appearance. Let‚Äôs look at a few numbers I‚Äôve captured&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that when I first started going to the gym in October-ish of 2022 I was 202 pounds and over 20% body fat. I measured myself again 2 months later in December and clocked in at 203 pounds but only 16% body fat. A pretty big drop! A steadfast commitment to my diet and playing a lot of basketball at the time probably had a lot to do with it. I measured myself again in September of this year (2023) and came in at 200 pounds (so pretty much the same weight) but now 12% body fat. &lt;em&gt;Amazing!&lt;/em&gt; I don‚Äôt really have a body fat % &lt;a href=&quot;#my-goals&quot;&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; but I‚Äôm happy to see that I‚Äôm maintaining weight while dropping fat. This means I‚Äôm replacing the fat with muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only other measurement I really have to help determine progress is to look at how much weight I‚Äôm lifting for different exercises. I‚Äôm not going to list every exercise I do, the weight I was lifting when I started and the weight I lift now, but I will provide some examples. Chest is a big focus of mine. I‚Äôve (clearly) never really had much in the way of chest muscles and it showed. I had some trouble even with the bar (45 lbs) when I first started, though I remember putting 20-50 extra lbs on there for &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; reps when I was in my early training sessions. Now, I‚Äôve hist 155-ish on bench press and 140 for dumbbells. Not bad! For arms, I was probably doing 25‚Äôs for my curls and do 40‚Äôs now. Similarly, I was probably doing 25‚Äôs for dumbbell military presses (shoulders) and do 55‚Äôs now. For leg day (which I actually enjoy) I went from squatting 115 maybe to doing well over two plates (so 225+ lbs). Anyways, I don‚Äôt know if this comes off as braggy or anything, hopefully it does not. As I‚Äôve said before, I‚Äôve &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; lifted weights. 34 years of my life came and went and I had never actually went to the gym and lifted. What this says to me and I hope says to others is that with a little commitment and discipline you can see some decent progression in a relative short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok awesome! Things have been going pretty good I think, but what are &lt;a href=&quot;#my-goals&quot;&gt;my goals&lt;/a&gt;? Where do I want to be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-goals&quot;&gt;My goals&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs hard to describe in any sort of exact way what my ‚Äúgoals‚Äù are. I have an idea of how I want to look but I don‚Äôt have any overtly specific strength goals or body fat % goals. I have two young kids so keeping up with them both from a stamina and picking-them-up-and-playing-with-them perspective is key. Aesthetically, losing the gut and boosting upper body muscle (chest + arms) is a goal. I‚Äôd like to stay in the 200-210 pound range while maintaining some amount of lean-ness. For my height (6‚Äô2‚Äù) this requires putting on a fair bit of muscle I think. I‚Äôm not looking to be ‚Äúshredded‚Äù or anything, I just want to maintain an athletic build that is in fact athletic (i.e. I can run, play sports, keep up with my kids, etc‚Ä¶)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More tactically, my goal isn‚Äôt to just reach a certain physique, but to reach it and then maintain it. This means building better habits around exercise and diet. To do so, I need to have consistency and efficiency in how I go about it. In the last year, I‚Äôve spent MORE time trying to right the (health) ship then I would like to once I hit maintenance mode. Not that I don‚Äôt enjoy working out, but I have other responsibilities and time is one currency that is hard to claw back. I want eating right to be second nature and I want to have an exercise program that allows me to maintain a certain strength/physique without me having to spend more hours than I need to at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt have any grand summary. I think I‚Äôve said it all in the ramblings above. I‚Äôm glad I recognized the unhealthy path I was on at an ‚Äúearly‚Äù stage and sought to correct it. I‚Äôm fortunate to have the time, resources and support from my family to allow me to work towards it. For any one else out there like me who sees themselves in progressively worse shape and wants to turn it around but knows nearly &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; about doing it, maybe my story can be helpful. Sit down, make a plan for exercise and diet and then execute on it. It‚Äôs not &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;, but I promise it can be fun &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; rewarding in relative short order. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The best of NoVA</title>
        <shark:summary><p>I‚Äôve lived in Northern Virginia (<strong>NoVA</strong>) for nearly 25 years. It‚Äôs a great place to live <em>if you can afford it</em>. Proximity to the beach, mountains and other states (WV, MD, DE, DC, NC, PA, NY, NJ), reliable job market and more! I wanted to capture a list of places/things I enjoy most around here so I can share it with others and reference it for myself in the future!</p>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve lived in Northern Virginia (&lt;strong&gt;NoVA&lt;/strong&gt;) for nearly 25 years. It‚Äôs a great place to live &lt;em&gt;if you can afford it&lt;/em&gt;. Proximity to the beach, mountains and other states (WV, MD, DE, DC, NC, PA, NY, NJ), reliable job market and more! I wanted to capture a list of places/things I enjoy most around here so I can share it with others and reference it for myself in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hiking &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/virginia/old-rag-mountain-loop-trail&quot;&gt;Old Rag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - This is by far the best hike in the area. But there are lots of other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alltrails.com/parks/us/virginia/shenandoah-national-park&quot;&gt;great hikes in Shenandoah&lt;/a&gt; too!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appalachian Moutains&lt;/strong&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;Shenandoah National Park&lt;/strong&gt; - Lots to see and do and in my opinion, one of the most beautiful places in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/sky-meadows&quot;&gt;Sky Meadows State Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Great hikes and an easy drive from most of NoVA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;NoVA wine/beer region&lt;/strong&gt; is incredible. Here are some of my favorite spots‚Ä¶
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hillsboroughwine.com/home&quot;&gt;Hillsborough Winery/Brewery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Great views, extremely fresh and tasty beer.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oldbusthead.com&quot;&gt;Old Bust Head Brewing Co.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Home of some great beers including the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oldbusthead.com/buckland-mill-milk-stout&quot;&gt;milk stout&lt;/a&gt; in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wheatlandspring.com&quot;&gt;Wheatland Spring Farm + Brewery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Small-batch beers that are delicious.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bluemontvineyard.com&quot;&gt;Bluemont Vineyard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Best views in the region. Good wine too.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don‚Äôt have a lot of &lt;em&gt;go-to&lt;/em&gt; restaurants but a few places I do adore are‚Ä¶
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rusticorestaurant.com/ballston&quot;&gt;Rustico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Huge selection of hard-to-find craft beers. Good food too.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deliriumcafe.us&quot;&gt;Cafe Delirium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; belgian beer. This place‚Äôs got it.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tuskies.com&quot;&gt;The Barn Yard ‚ÄúAu Jus‚Äù sandwich at Tuscarora Mill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - The best sandwich that I‚Äôve ever eaten.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://downtownleesburgva.org&quot;&gt;Downtown Leesburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - A lot of great restaurants to be found.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Where I find the time</title>
        <shark:summary><p>I‚Äôm <em>pretty busy</em>. I‚Äôm a father, a husband and have a full-time job (in Cybersecurity fwiw). I have this blog that I frequently update, a podcast (that desperately needs my attention) and a ton of in-progress or neglected side projects. On top of all that, I spend a lot of time learning on the side, go the gym pretty much every day and like to travel. So where do I find the time?</p>
</shark:summary>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm &lt;em&gt;pretty busy&lt;/em&gt;. I‚Äôm a father, a husband and have a full-time job (in Cybersecurity fwiw). I have this blog that I frequently update, a podcast (that desperately needs my attention) and a ton of in-progress or neglected side projects. On top of all that, I spend a lot of time learning on the side, go the gym pretty much every day and like to travel. So where do I find the time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to &lt;em&gt;make time&lt;/em&gt; in the day, here are some strategies I employ (in no particular order)‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep less&lt;/strong&gt;: Some might argue this isn‚Äôt the &lt;em&gt;healthiest&lt;/em&gt; strategy and they‚Äôre probably right. I am however one of those people who can get by on less sleep than maybe an average person (&lt;em&gt;5-6 hours usually&lt;/em&gt;). Maybe it‚Äôs not something you make a habit of, or maybe you learn you can live on less sleep than you are used to getting. Either way, this is a simple technique for making extra time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give things up&lt;/strong&gt;: We all have time-wasting activities, some that are likely pretty chronic. Gaming, watching TV, scrolling social media, whatever it is - try to cut these things out completely to shore up time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut back&lt;/strong&gt;: If giving things up &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; isn‚Äôt an option, try instead to just cut back on something. Used to gaming an hour a day? Maybe try an hour every &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobility&lt;/strong&gt;: Having a mobile workstation, i.e. laptop, tablet, etc‚Ä¶, can give you the ability to do work anywhere in the house or on the go, including in the small windows of time you might otherwise not have been doing anything. As an example, when my son is busy with solo play or TV, I could use that as an opportunity to do a few quick tasks on my iPad!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-task&lt;/strong&gt;: Doing more than one thing at a time can help you claw some time back. Can you take a meeting while you eat/make lunch? Life is full of waiting for things, is it possible to get some work done in one of the many waiting times you have in a day?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side-project selectivity&lt;/strong&gt;: I‚Äôm a person who always keeps busy, always has ideas and always comes up with little side-projects. Over the years, this has led to a lot of half-finished/abandoned projects which amounted to little more than time wasted. I‚Äôve had the luxury of being able to afford wasting time throwing things at the wall and seeing what stuck, but these days, with time at more of a premium, I need to be more selective with what I choose to embark upon. So scrap the projects you know are going nowhere, focus on the ones with real finishing power and only pick up new ones that are truly important to you or that you know you can finish.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize&lt;/strong&gt;: Leverage some classic prioritization tools like to-do lists and calendar apps. Put all the meaningful things you need to do in your to-do app. Separate them into categories for home, work, side-project, etc‚Ä¶ Give yourself due dates and look at / prioritize your list &lt;strong&gt;daily&lt;/strong&gt; (this is among the first things I do each morning). Use a calendar app too to keep track of events you have for the day/week/month. Plan around your events and cancel things you don‚Äôt need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;: Goals are very important in terms of how you spend your time. If you‚Äôre doing something that doesn‚Äôt progress you to achieving one or more of your goals, than you could probably cut it. Goals could be family, fitness, career, or other-related.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Efficient&lt;/strong&gt;: In doing anything, try to be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; efficient at it. If doing task A would normally take you 30 minutes, find a way to do it in 20. Be better prepared, automate, know when things are ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù and find other process improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a constant motor, i.e. maximizing your time by constantly achieving things that progress to one of your goals takes discipline, but it also takes understanding what your goals are and what subtasks comprise those goals. There will be times throughout the day where you only have 1 minute, 5 minutes, 30 minutes or whatever to do something and you need to know how to fill that time with something productive. If I have a very short window, maybe I use that to do a quick workout (e.g. pushups, ab exercises, dumbbell curls) or I triage email or I write out a few quick thoughts for a blog post I‚Äôm working on. Keeping &lt;strong&gt;momentum&lt;/strong&gt; is key here. Keeping the &lt;strong&gt;goal&lt;/strong&gt; in mind is also crucial. It‚Äôs easy to slack off, get side-tracked or feel lazy and no matter how good you are, you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; likely fall prey to this to some extent. But get yourself back on track by visualizing your goal and then get started again on the tasks that help you achieve it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, you can‚Äôt do it all, so do what‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt;. Remember to set aside time for yourself, &lt;em&gt;though ideally that time would be goal-driven&lt;/em&gt;. Know your limitations and don‚Äôt burn yourself out!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is my &lt;strong&gt;‚Äútech‚Äù EDC&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Every-Day-Carry&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/notes/2023/TechEDC.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;TechEDC&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;iPhone 15 Pro Max (&lt;em&gt;White, 512GB&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Airpods Max (&lt;em&gt;Sky Blue&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Airpods Pro (&lt;em&gt;2nd generation&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apple Watch charging cable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;USB-A to Lightning cable (&lt;em&gt;1m&lt;/em&gt;), w/ wall adapter&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Technically&lt;/em&gt; I don‚Äôt have much of an ‚ÄúEDC‚Äù since I work from home and when I do leave my house, it‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;typically&lt;/em&gt; not to a place where I plan on doing any work so I likely don‚Äôt even have my backpack with me. But if/when I do go somewhere where I want to do a little work, this is what I‚Äôll have with me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I like to consider myself a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/about?about=travel&quot;&gt;fairly well-traveled&lt;/a&gt; person and someone who just generally loves travel. Last I counted I had been to 25 countries and 28 US states. One fun way to visualize where I‚Äôve been has been these colorful where-i‚Äôve-traveled maps from &lt;a href=&quot;https://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2022/10/us-level-0.html&quot;&gt;Google Maps Mania&lt;/a&gt; which have been making the rounds on social media lately. I decided to figure out my own US Level and Europe Level scores and share them with you here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;us-level&quot;&gt;US Level&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/notes/2023/USLevel.png&quot; alt=&quot;US Level&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;eu-level&quot;&gt;EU Level&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/notes/2023/EuropeLevel.png&quot; alt=&quot;EU Level&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These definitely make me want to get out there and travel more! Figure out your score and let me know about it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@shellsharks/111369273328967499&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@mk3s/post/CzWGY8cOflh&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, here‚Äôs ten of my favorite things I‚Äôve done throughout my travels (in no particular order).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going on safari in Kruger national park (&lt;em&gt;South Africa&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything in Bruge - the eating, the drinking, the picturesque town (&lt;em&gt;Belgium&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Driving through the mountains in Triglav national park (&lt;em&gt;Slovenia&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mountain climbing in the Faroe Islands (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alltrails.com/trail/faroe-islands/eysturoy/villingardalsfjall&quot;&gt;Villingardalsfjall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taking a history tour in Mostar (&lt;em&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walking the ramparts in the old city of Dubrovnik (&lt;em&gt;Croatia&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going to the beach and swimming in the Algarve (&lt;em&gt;Portugal&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enjoying the winter and winter markets of Budapest (&lt;em&gt;Hungary&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sightseeing the city of Prague (&lt;em&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drinking fresh draft Pilsner Urquell in Czech Republic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>NaBloPoMo</title>
        <shark:summary><p>November is here, and for bloggers that means <strong><a href="https://emkennedy.net/blog/2006/10/nablopomo.html">National Blog Posting Month</a></strong> (or <em>#NaBloPoMo</em>) is upon us!

        <description>&lt;p&gt;November is here, and for bloggers that means &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://emkennedy.net/blog/2006/10/nablopomo.html&quot;&gt;National Blog Posting Month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;#NaBloPoMo&lt;/em&gt;) is upon us! To be honest, this is not something I had heard of before but thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://social.design.systems/@Amy_Hupe/111334801635052328&quot;&gt;this post from Amy Hupe&lt;/a&gt;, I am now aware. The NaBloPoMo challenge? Post each day of the month of November, so 30 posts in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve spent some time &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; compiling a little over 30 ideas for things I can write about so I‚Äôm off to a decent start. I have a wide range of topics (and micro-topics) planned, everything from Apple to gaming to techie stuff im up to and even some other general stuff goin‚Äô on in my life. Most of these daily writings will be published out through my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notebook&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; feed but some may also be published as full-fledged blog posts. Day one will simply be this starter post, but I‚Äôll spend some time today getting ahead of future days as well. Given the pace in which these need to be turned around, I suspect they will be rather short-form and a little rougher around the edges in general, but the idea here is as Amy put it, to break away from blogging perfectionism and just get your thoughts, ideas and work out into the world, so that is what I‚Äôll be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Off to it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;nablopomo-2023-archive&quot;&gt;NaBloPoMo 2023 Archive&lt;/h1&gt;

        <title>Where we live on</title>
        <shark:summary><p>I recently shared a <a href="/notes/2023/08/16/your-website-your-identity">note</a> about why having a domain as your identity is so important these days thanks in large part to the enshittification of the large social platforms. But I extend this warning to those who have placed their trust in <em>any</em> platform, even something like Mastodon. See what has happend with <a href="http://outdoors.lgbt">outdoors.lgbt</a> (i.e. catastrophic backup failure), <a href="https://honeytree.social/@jeff/110955710330098067">newsie.social</a> (i.e. server upkeep costs), or what is <em>currently</em> happening with <a href="https://m6n.io/@fuzzychef/110936040096524936">fosstodon</a> and you will see that even good intentioned server admins are still prone to failure. These failures can result in total loss of your online identity/account. So put your faith in yourself. Buy a domain, host your stuff there, syndicate it out where you please, <strong>live on</strong>.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@shellsharks/110945885233382137&quot;&gt;I‚Äôll add to this&lt;/a&gt;. Even here @ &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/&quot;&gt;infosec.exchange&lt;/a&gt; this rings true. You can‚Äôt ask for a better server admin than &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@jerry&quot;&gt;@jerry&lt;/a&gt; . Even-handed, extremely technically-proficient, community-oriented, you name it. But a day will inevitably come when Jerry has to hang it up one way or another, whether that be to pass admin-ship onto new worthy ownership or w/e. With any luck, that new era of infosec.exchange will inherit the same awesome stability we will have enjoyed up to that point, but if not, better to have your own stable point on the web (i.e. your domain) that you can always fall back and point people to. Happy webbin‚Äô!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Your website, your identity</title>
        <shark:summary><p>I previously wrote about <a href="/you-should-blog">why you should start a blog</a>. That piece is filled with solid reasons I still stand by today. But since that time, I‚Äôve come to understand a more meaningful reason to have a website and as part of that site, some form of syndicated content (i.e. a blog). For most, ‚Äúidentity‚Äù on the web is tied to one, or fractured across a few, social media platform(s). Recent history has revealed the pitfalls of this approach. Enshittification, terrible management, or even platform collapse can result in catastrophic loss of your connections, communities, business income and more. So many refuse to leave Twitter (<em>er‚Ä¶</em> ‚ÄúX‚Äù) because their too invested, to leave would be to sacrifice one or more of these things. Why do we continue to feed these platforms that always fail, that always betray us, that violate our privacy, that never represent who we truly are? Having a website, a place that is yours, that you can design to your specification, share anything you want, how you want and make <em>easily</em> available to all is such an obvious solution and it really isn‚Äôt that much harder than creating a (pick your social media platform of choice) account. There are a TON of services these days that make it dead simple to get up and running with a customizable site and start publishing. The beauty of this (blogging), is that you can syndicate however you‚Äôd like from there. So go ahead, share on Mastodon, or Threads, or wherever, but remember to link back to the true canonical representation on your site.</p>

        <title>Split social personalities</title>
        <shark:summary><p>I‚Äôve always tried to maintain two(ish) personas online, personal and professional (infosec). Over time these lines definitely have blurred but I still tend to have two separately maintained identities, e.g. LinkedIn vs Facebook (which I haven‚Äôt really used in years), two Twitter accounts, two Mastodon accounts, etc‚Ä¶ For my ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù social media usage, honestly I could go anywhere - Mastodon, Threads, BlueSky, w/e.</p>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always tried to maintain two(ish) personas online, personal and professional (infosec). Over time these lines definitely have blurred but I still tend to have two separately maintained identities, e.g. LinkedIn vs Facebook (which I haven‚Äôt really used in years), two Twitter accounts, two Mastodon accounts, etc‚Ä¶ For my ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù social media usage, honestly I could go anywhere - Mastodon, Threads, BlueSky, w/e.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For #infosec, I want to be where other infosec people are, and I need the ability to have a curated (just who I follow) feed, which is what Mastodon gives me. I came over to infosec.exchange/Mastodon in earnest in late 2022 during one of the larger Twitter exoduses as did many other infosec folks. I really hope people keep at least their infosec selves here and continue to engage/contribute but with all these new entrants (BlueSky, Threads, Spill, w/e) and other drama with fedipact fracturing, I‚Äôm a little worried the infosec-specific timeline and engagement could dry up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FWIW, I am committed to #Mastodon and the larger #Fediverse as my professional/tech-chat home for the long term and hope to see (at least) this specific community continue to grow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little more on this‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always felt the need to maintain two identities not because I was worried about those in my professional sphere being exposed to my personal sphere/chatter (or vice versa) but because I always appreciated those that I followed that kept their personal chatter to a minimum. Now I understand maintaining two identities like this is tough and certainly don‚Äôt fault anyone for posting non-work things on their social accounts (i.e. maintaining a single all-encompassing identity), but I wanted to at least try to be that for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if #Mastodon fades into relative obscurity and ceases to be a place where I can get breaking infosec news and conversations about infosec going, I feel good in my backup strategy of leveraging my comprehensive infosec #RSS &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/infosec-blogs&quot;&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; for read-only news and the #threadiverse /similar platforms for conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@keefer Honestly, even for me I can tolerate a good ratio of personal : professional stuff coming from most people‚Äôs feeds. But there are those who post like 10x+/day every day and &amp;lt;1% is anything infosec/tech-adjacent. These accounts are typically ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù types who have managed to cobble together a large following which seems to go their head a bit =P. I‚Äôm probably on the more extreme end of follow-pruning and I don‚Äôt mind the personal stuff - easy enough to scroll by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Twitter‚Äôs many faults over the years, I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get some professional/infosec use out of it thanks to some high-fidelity feeds from cyber personalities and researchers. I aimed to be that while I was there, but never really found a niche posting anything out onto Twitter, so mostly I just lurked. I‚Äôve found on Mastodon that I have felt far more comfortable posting, engaging and things just seem very authentic. Because of this, the lines between the pure-infosec-professional persona and the ‚Äúeverything else‚Äù persona have blurred quite a bit. I‚Äôll probably continue to keep things separate to some degree but would actually encourage you and most people to just feel comfortable sharing non-infosec or non-professional stuff on the same account as everything else. Unless you‚Äôre one of those super high volume posters I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll run the risk of annoying anyone or losing followers or w/e. If anything, you‚Äôre more likely to build better, stronger connections - like, ‚Äúhey! that person who also works in infosec loves hiking and thinks alligators are cool! same as me!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

</shark:summary>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My socialization summary (based on a weeks usage from my iPhone‚Äôs Screen Time app).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mastodon ‚Äî&amp;gt; Infosec, general news (50%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instagram ‚Äî&amp;gt; Posting travel pics, following gym-fluencers (18%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reddit ‚Äî&amp;gt; Infosec, Apple, personal finance, other hobbies (10%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slack ‚Äî&amp;gt; Work, other professional communities (6%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iMessage &amp;amp; Google Voice ‚Äî&amp;gt; Most 1-1 communication (4%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linkedin ‚Äî&amp;gt; Lurk, Job searching (3%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bluesky ‚Äî&amp;gt; TBD (3%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discord ‚Äî&amp;gt; Infosec, gaming (2%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blind ‚Äî&amp;gt; TC or GTFO‚Äôing (2%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Twitter ‚Äî&amp;gt; Still have my username but don‚Äôt really use (1%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nostr ‚Äî&amp;gt; Barely use (&amp;lt;1%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Signal ‚Äî&amp;gt; Chat with specific people (&amp;lt;1%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Matrix ‚Äî&amp;gt; Barely use (&amp;lt;1%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My takeaways‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I main Mastodon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I need to delete Instagram&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slack % doesn‚Äôt include work so that is skewed‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discord is low. I need to game more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At over a day (24h) of collective screen time, in a week‚Äôs span, I need to re-prioritize some things in my life haha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <shark:summary><blockquote>
  <p>Calm. Kindness, kinship. Love. I‚Äôve given up all chance at inner peace, I‚Äôve made my mind a sunless space. I share my dreams with ghosts. I wake up every day to an equation I wrote 15 years ago from which there‚Äôs only one conclusion: I‚Äôm damned for what I do. My anger, my ego, my unwillingness to yield, my eagerness to fight, they‚Äôve set me on a path from which there is no escape. I yearned to be a savior against injustice without contemplating the cost, and by the time I looked down, there was no longer any ground beneath my feet.</p>

  <p>What is‚Ä¶ what is my sacrifice? I‚Äôm condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them. I burn my decency for someone else‚Äôs future. I burn my life, to make a sunrise that I know I‚Äôll never see. No, the ego that started this fight will never have a mirror, or an audience, or the light of gratitude. So what do I sacrifice?</p>

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#expanded-fediverse&quot;&gt;Expanded Fediverse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-take-on-mastodon-so-far&quot;&gt;My Take On Mastodon So Far&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;#mastodon&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href=&quot;#expanded-fediverse&quot;&gt;Fediverse&lt;/a&gt;) that I have yet to learn, but what I do know is that &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; has (pretty much) already surpassed what Twitter was to me in both personal and professional contexts. I had a Twitter account for years, and try as I might, I never felt quite &lt;em&gt;comfortable&lt;/em&gt; being anything more than a passive consumer - a lurker of those in the #infosectwitter community who had big followings. Though there was of course a decent amount of discussion/engagement within the infosec Twitter world, it often seemed to me very clique-ey, reserved only to those with big followerships or with well-known personas and established circles. I also always had the sense that trying to cultivate a following on Twitter was, &lt;em&gt;sorta cringey&lt;/em&gt;. People there seemed more interested in boosting their follower counts or their follower-to-following ratio than expanding their true community. This feeling was ever-perpetuated by the constant deluge of tweets sounding off about how many followers they had, or how close they were to a certain follower threshold, etc‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, &lt;em&gt;I get it&lt;/em&gt; - I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/podcast&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, I understand why people &lt;em&gt;crave&lt;/em&gt; followers. It‚Äôs the &lt;em&gt;engagement&lt;/em&gt; I am after though, not so much just having my tweets/toots/posts/&lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; show up in a lot of people‚Äôs timelines. I genuinely enjoy sharing my thoughts/ideas, and even moreso hearing/learning from others. Naturally, a good way to create this engagement is to network, follow a lot of people and of course, have others ‚Äúfollow‚Äù me. I never had a big following on Twitter (~190ish as of the last time I looked), and I never got much engagement there (partially because I rarely posted). I‚Äôve been on Mastodon for nearly 2 weeks and already I‚Äôve seen &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better engagement (and I am not alone). Maybe it‚Äôs the novelty factor, or maybe it‚Äôs because it hasn‚Äôt had time to turn into a toxic stew, it could be because I am more actively engaging. I‚Äôm not really sure yet, but what I do know is the &lt;strong&gt;vibe&lt;/strong&gt; is different. That sense of community is definitely there and I am looking to make the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alright&lt;/em&gt;, so I have a few other thoughts/takes on my Mastodon experience so far, and as I am want to do, I will share via a list!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As others have pointed out, two reasons why Twitter always felt a bit, &lt;em&gt;icky&lt;/em&gt;, was because of forced ads in your timeline and the bedeviling algorithm which fed not what &lt;em&gt;YOU&lt;/em&gt; wanted into your timeline, but what Twitter thought would yield maximum engagement, which typically meant trying to fill you with rage. Mastodon is a breath of fresh air in comparison.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I joined the &lt;a href=&quot;#infosecexchange&quot;&gt;infosec.exchange&lt;/a&gt; instance, which is relatively quite large (~24k and growing) and have &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.social/@shellsharks/following&quot;&gt;followed&lt;/a&gt; nearly 400 people so far. What I‚Äôve seen across my home feed and the local timeline has been really great! No ads, literally just what I‚Äôve signed up for. I‚Äôve been consuming/scrolling most of it so far and have encountered a lot of new people and genuinely look forward to (most) of what they have to share.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mastodon is a series of unique, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;networked&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://instances.social&quot;&gt;instances&lt;/a&gt;. When folks from other instances are &lt;em&gt;boosted&lt;/em&gt; into my timeline, there is a sense of excitement, of exploration. For example, if I see someone with the handle &lt;em&gt;@hax@supercyber.pizza&lt;/em&gt;, I think ‚Äúwow! I‚Äôm happy to have discovered this indvidual in the wide Fediverse, and look forward to what they post/boost into my timeline‚Äù. That hunger to follow, to connect moreso than ‚Äúget followers‚Äù is really great. I have this desire to collect as many cool instances and awesome people as I can into my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.social/@shellsharks/following&quot;&gt;following list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want people to follow you, or engage with you, I highly recommend spending some time to tell people what you‚Äôre all about in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.social/@shellsharks/&quot;&gt;account profile&lt;/a&gt;. Also, toss a picture of some kind in there. Anything will do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each instance will likely have its own culture, traditions and of course rules. Spend some time trying to figure out what those are, and leverage the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#cw&quot;&gt;content warning&lt;/a&gt; (CW) feature to try and be a little less offensive. &lt;em&gt;It‚Äôs not hard to do&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being on an instance which has a population that best shares your personal/professional interests will give you a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/timelines/&quot;&gt;local timeline&lt;/a&gt; that will help you find people to follow and consume your posts. This is true. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt;! With a little effort, you can, regardless of what instance you are on, curate a following of people &lt;em&gt;across&lt;/em&gt; instances, building a home timeline that is perfect for you, void of ads or algorithmic influences. This feed/timeline will continue to grow and mature thanks to the boosts and discussions of those you follow and engage with. So spend less time trying to find the perfect instance, and more time building that list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is any drawback to Mastodon so far that I have seen, it is the lack of full-text search (for privacy reasons). This makes some of the intel-gathering I used to do on Twitter a bit more difficult (I‚Äôm not the only one with this sentiment). One frequent use-case was to search for info on CVEs (e.g. PoCs, research, etc‚Ä¶). To address this concern, the &lt;a href=&quot;#infosec-community&quot;&gt;infosec community&lt;/a&gt; on Mastodon has been putting their heads together on how best to use hashtags to make intel-gathering possible on Mastodon. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@shellsharks/109312621380439732&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@_mattata/109344401551654192&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosstodon.org/@mttaggart/109349346996034218&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;mastodon&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro-to-mastodon&quot;&gt;Intro to Mastodon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid writing a regurgitated ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;how to get started w/ Mastodon&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù section, I‚Äôm going to first just link to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; article on this - &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-started-use-mastodon/&quot;&gt;How to Get Started on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, I want to emphasize - try not to stress too much on what ‚Äúinstance‚Äù you choose. This should only really affect your ‚Äúlocal‚Äù timeline, not your ability to follow those anywhere, on any instance (unless you wish to follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.secjuice.com/mastodon-child-porn-pedophiles/&quot;&gt;dregs&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;#expanded-fediverse&quot;&gt;Fediverse&lt;/a&gt; that tend to get de-&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jwz.org/blog/2022/11/mastodon-and-federation/&quot;&gt;federated&lt;/a&gt; from the upstanding servers). Alternatively, for those that are adventurous, have some free time and are relatively tech savvy, &lt;a href=&quot;#hosting-a-mastodon-instance&quot;&gt;hosting your own instance&lt;/a&gt; on a vanity domain is another option! If you don‚Äôt end up liking an instance you‚Äôve landed on, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/06/how-to-migrate-from-one-server-to-another/&quot;&gt;how to migrate from one server to another&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt;, that out of the way, here‚Äôs a list of other Mastodon stuff‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick (I promise) rundown of Mastodon verbiage/mechanics‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Posts&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;del&gt;are&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/mastodon-toot-retired-twitter-tweet-equivalent-1849786221&quot;&gt;were&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;Toots&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù, now they‚Äôre just ‚Äúposts‚Äù. Ask your instance admin to &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.disroot.org/badrihippo/tootify&quot;&gt;tootify&lt;/a&gt; the server if you miss tootin‚Äô (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosstodon.org/@benjaminhollon/109355527163671306&quot;&gt;@benjaminhollon@fosstodon.org&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A re-post (or re-tweet) is a ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;Boost&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/99662106175542726&quot;&gt;There is no quote-boost&lt;/a&gt;, so don‚Äôt ask. Boosting helps propagate stuff you like to all your followers and to your local timeline. This helps get stuff out to other instances. &lt;em&gt;Boosts are good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;Star&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù simply communicates to the OP, ‚ÄúI like that‚Äù. It has no effect on anything else. So &lt;em&gt;star star star&lt;/em&gt; away!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lists&lt;/strong&gt; exist.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unlike Twitter, Mastodon has no full-text search. It instead relies on &lt;strong&gt;hashtags&lt;/strong&gt;. So use those liberally where applicable. You can also follow hashtags. (per &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@tinker/109330871957962166&quot;&gt;@tinker@infosec.exchange&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The consensus seems to be that the first-party Mastodon client is bad. Try some of these other apps instead‚Ä¶
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metatext/id1523996615&quot;&gt;Metatext&lt;/a&gt; for iOS&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.fedilab.android&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=DE&amp;amp;pli=1&quot;&gt;Fedilab&lt;/a&gt; for Android&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git.shadowfacts.net/shadowfacts/Tusker&quot;&gt;Tusker&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@jxhn/109337746209475152&quot;&gt;@jxhn@infosec.exchange&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One cool thing you can do via Mastodon is retrieve a &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@SteveD3/109345603084458028&quot;&gt;.rss feed of an account‚Äôs posts&lt;/a&gt; per &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@SteveD3&quot;&gt;@SteveD3@infosec.exchange&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now get out there and &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@tinker/109321493379634906&quot;&gt;toot to your hearts content&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;verification&quot;&gt;Verification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/#verification&quot;&gt;Mastodon has a verification capability&lt;/a&gt;, though it differs from what Twitter traditionally offered. Essentially, you can establish a ‚Äúverified‚Äù relationship between your Mastodon account and other third-party endpoints, such as a website. What this can prove is that, for example, the identity/person behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.social/@shellsharks&quot;&gt;@shellsharks@sehllsharks.social&lt;/a&gt; Mastodon account is the same person who runs &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/&quot;&gt;shellsharks.com&lt;/a&gt;. Some other verification related resources are provided below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;security--privacy&quot;&gt;Security &amp;amp; Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is &lt;a href=&quot;#mastodon&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; secure? Is my data private? Is it more secure than Twitter? (these days, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html&quot;&gt;almost assuredly&lt;/a&gt;). How can I best lock down my Mastodon account(s)? All great questions. I‚Äôll share a list of articles that best answer these questions but first, some basic security/privacy hygiene advice. &lt;strong&gt;Use a strong/unique password&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/contacts/#account&quot;&gt;enable 2FA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, understand that your instance admin has access to your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;infosec-community&quot;&gt;Infosec Community&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used Twitter for years, as there was a relatively vibrant &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/tags/infosec&quot;&gt;#infosec&lt;/a&gt; community that shared research, articles, etc‚Ä¶ With the &lt;a href=&quot;#twitter-migration&quot;&gt;meltdown of Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, it seems the infosec-Twitter diaspora has gone full-force and we (as a community) now primarily exist across a &lt;a href=&quot;#infosec-instances&quot;&gt;variety of Mastodon instances&lt;/a&gt;. The community that has developed, and the speed at which it has developed, has been truly astounding to behold. For my part, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.social/@shellsharks&quot;&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; joined &lt;a href=&quot;#infosecexchange&quot;&gt;infosec.exchange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre looking to find others in the infosec world on Mastodon‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gsheet with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t13k5_cNhP9_TgoUmqDZk2ROkWkF6Bg3O5269vKIqWw/htmlview&quot;&gt;mapping of Twitter‚Äì&amp;gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; accounts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tisiphone.net/2022/11/10/infosec-mastodon-lists/&quot;&gt;Infosec Mastodon Lists!&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tisiphone.net/&quot;&gt;tisiphone.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Or join an open &lt;a href=&quot;#infosec-instances&quot;&gt;infosec instance&lt;/a&gt; and just start following people! &lt;strong&gt;Pro tip&lt;/strong&gt;: you can (for open instances) view the local timeline for any instance, whether you are a member or not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve written up a quite note - a ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/10/20/infosec-mastodon-starter-pack&quot;&gt;starter pack&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù - for those new to Mastodon. It includes some bonus info for &lt;em&gt;infosec&lt;/em&gt; folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;infosecexchange&quot;&gt;infosec.exchange&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;infosec.exchange&quot;&gt;infosec.exchange&lt;/a&gt; is described as ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;a Mastodon instance for info/cyber security-minded people.&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù No better way to describe it! It was stood up and is admin‚Äôed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@jerry&quot;&gt;Jerry Bell&lt;/a&gt; (host of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://defensivesecurity.org&quot;&gt;Defensive Security Podcast&lt;/a&gt; and seemingly trustworthy infosec fella.) So far, the experience as a member of this server has been great. The community is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; infosec-ey, friendly and growing quickly. Some other cool tidbits on infosec.exchange have been provided below‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.infosec.exchange&quot;&gt;infosec.exchange wiki&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Currently, infosec.exchange supports &lt;strong&gt;11k word&lt;/strong&gt; posts. ELEVEN THOUSAND! Plenty of elbow room&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#hosting-a-mastodon-instance&quot;&gt;Running a Mastodon instance&lt;/a&gt;, and doing it as well as Jerry has takes time, expertise, patience and money. To help out, consider contributing via &lt;a href=&quot;https://liberapay.com/Infosec.exchange/&quot;&gt;liberapay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anecdotally (and from multiple accounts I have seen from infosec.exchange members so far), engagement on posts/polls/replies has been outstanding - easily outpacing what others saw on Twitter, even with much more massive follower counts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;infosec.exchange &lt;em&gt;very quickly&lt;/em&gt; ramped from ~300 to over 20k (24k at the time of this post) in a matter of weeks. So donate and consider configuring post auto-delete (per &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/@spapjh/109325460580938968&quot;&gt;@spapjh@infosec.exchange&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of great, open &lt;a href=&quot;https://instances.social&quot;&gt;instances to join&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in &lt;a href=&quot;#mastodon&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;. But if you‚Äôre interested in hosting your own server, that too is possible! In fact, I plan on trying this out at some point. For anyone interested, and for reference myself when the time comes, here are some resources/discussions I have collected‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;twitter-migration&quot;&gt;Twitter Migration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not particularly interested in analyzing or writing much about what‚Äôs going on w/ Twitter. What I will say is that I‚Äôve pretty much left (my account &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shellsharks&quot;&gt;still exists&lt;/a&gt; but I am no longer looking at my feed and haven‚Äôt signed in since I joined &lt;a href=&quot;#mastodon&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;), and generally speaking, the &lt;a href=&quot;#infosec-community&quot;&gt;infosec community&lt;/a&gt; seems to have almost fully disowned the platform. From what I have read and seen, it does seem to have turned into a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitterisgoinggreat.com&quot;&gt;dumpster fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I know not what the future holds for Twitter, but for many reasons &lt;a href=&quot;#my-take-on-mastodon-so-far&quot;&gt;I am happy with where I have landed&lt;/a&gt; and look forward to making Mastodon my long-term home, regardless of Twitter‚Äôs ultimate fate. That said, if you are interested in moving yourself or reading more about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://infosec.exchange/tags/twittermigration&quot;&gt;#twittermigration&lt;/a&gt;, check out the resources below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@sass&quot;&gt;I joined Mastodon in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but never really made much of it at the time. I rejoined in earnest in November (2022) so I am obviously not a &lt;a href=&quot;#mastodon&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; pro nor particularly experienced/knowledgeable about the wider ‚ÄúFediverse‚Äù. So I won‚Äôt pretend to be. Instead, here is some stuff that you may be interested in, and that I will continue to dig into as I have time‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIf you find yourself alone, riding in green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled. For you are on Mastodon, and not on Twitter!‚Äù - &lt;em&gt;Mastodonius Decimus Meridius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#Gladiator is the best movie of all time. I can‚Äôt be convinced otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;practical-mechanics&quot;&gt;Practical Mechanics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/inbox-zero#title&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; on Inbox Zero, I introduce a number of concepts and steps for &lt;em&gt;zeroing out&lt;/em&gt; an inbox, but notably absent are some of the specifics on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I actually do it. In this section, I cover the tooling, procedures and other variables I use to churn through my email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sections below, I cover a variety of techniques, specifics and examples for steps &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Take Action&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Save For Later&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Archive&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Delete&lt;/em&gt;) of my previously detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/inbox-zero#lets-zero-it-out&quot;&gt;zeroing-out methodology&lt;/a&gt;. Steps &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Unsubscribe&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Consume&lt;/em&gt;) are pretty simple so I really don‚Äôt have anything else of substance to add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;taking-action&quot;&gt;Taking Action&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To succeed with Inbox Zero, it is crucial to attack emails with a very action-oriented mindset. Email can not be allowed to live rent-free in your inbox or in your head. If we‚Äôre not unsubscribing, easily-consuming, archiving or deleting email right away it‚Äôs important to ask ourselves, ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;what needs to be done to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;complete&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;this email&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù. Some techniques I employ are described below‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Augment your inbox with a to-do system&lt;/strong&gt;: Riding side-saddle to my inbox, I rely on my trusty &lt;a href=&quot;https://todoist.com/&quot;&gt;to-do app&lt;/a&gt; to help me remember and prioritize items. Email apps are &lt;strong&gt;very ineffective&lt;/strong&gt; to-do apps &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and thus shouldn‚Äôt be used as one, but your inbox &lt;em&gt;does generate&lt;/em&gt; a lot of to-do‚Äôs! Naturally then, it makes sense to &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; a ‚Äúto-do‚Äù for respective items in your inbox. By doing this, you can move an email out of your main inbox and into an appropriate folder, whether that be the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/inbox-zero#lets-zero-it-out&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or somewhere else. With a stub for that email now in your to-do app, you can safely have it out of your inbox and take care of it based on your own to-do methodology (more on this later &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As an example, let‚Äôs say you get an email from your dentist, reminding you to schedule your six-month cleaning. Rather than leaving it in the inbox, I would create an item in my to-do app with a subject such as ‚Äúschedule 6-month dentist appointment‚Äù, then I‚Äôd &lt;em&gt;delete&lt;/em&gt; the email! If there is information in the email I need to help schedule the appointment, I could &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; move the email to the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder rather than deleting it. Once I‚Äôve completed the task, I could then go back into that folder and delete it for good.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I personally take this approach to a particular extreme. For emails that require a substantive task to be completed (i.e. not just consuming information), I will &lt;em&gt;often&lt;/em&gt; create a to-do, even if I can complete it right away! The very act of creating the to-do and then marking it as complete has a &lt;a href=&quot;#psychology&quot;&gt;psychologically-positive&lt;/a&gt; effect. Checking things off, no matter how small, can help build productive momentum &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Just be sure to not overdo it here as creating endless tiny to-dos would certainly introduce counter-productive overhead when done at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stars and flags&lt;/strong&gt;: Email systems usually have the concept of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/mail/answer/5904&quot;&gt;starring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/guide/mail/flag-emails-mlhlp1052/mac&quot;&gt;flagging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; an email as a way to denote its relative importance. If you follow the guidance from the previous bullet (creating to-do‚Äôs associated with emails and tackling them that way) then you &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; don‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to utilize stars/flags as you would be taking things &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of email and prioritizing them in your to-do system instead. With that said, I still star things in my email app as it does add that extra bit of emphasis and urgency for certain emails that I know I need to get to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The power of delegation&lt;/strong&gt;: Delegation is an under-utilized action in the world of people‚Äôs personal email (and to-do methodologies in general). There is plenty of email I receive that in order to fully ‚Äútake action‚Äù on it, there is a dependency on someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As an example, I may get an email about picking something up from the store but need to coordinate with my wife on when to go. In this case, the dependency is getting a response from my wife about it. Here I could forward the email to my wife (or text her), suggesting a time for me to go pick it up. Now I can move this email to ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù as it doesn‚Äôt require any additional action from me. Further, I can create a task in my to-do with a subject such as ‚Äúpick up the thing from the store‚Äù. Here I took decisive action on the email, I progressed the task and most importantly, I got one email closer to Inbox Zero!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inbox checking frequency&lt;/strong&gt;: This is entirely up to you and really just depends on your own philosophy around ‚Äúdisconnecting‚Äù. With that said, depending on the volume of email you receive, I recommend checking it &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; frequently in order to be able to process it in smaller chunks. (&lt;a href=&quot;#psychology&quot;&gt;More on this later&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;saving-for-later&quot;&gt;Saving for Later&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt;, so as we have seen in the &lt;a href=&quot;#taking-action&quot;&gt;previous section&lt;/a&gt;, a lot of what ‚Äútaking action‚Äù means in reality is in fact &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; taking &lt;em&gt;immediate&lt;/em&gt; action but rather storing the respective item for action at a later date. There are a few techniques &lt;em&gt;I use&lt;/em&gt; for this. You can use one or more of these simultaneously to help stay on top of what you need to do while also keeping that inbox shiny and clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The enigmatic ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder&lt;/strong&gt;: I put a fair amount of things in my &lt;em&gt;notorious&lt;/em&gt; ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/inbox-zero#lets-zero-it-out&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - and for a &lt;em&gt;variety&lt;/em&gt; of reasons. One could argue, ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;why is having a bunch of stuff in a separate For Later folder better than just keeping it in your inbox?‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; I‚Äôll cover the &lt;a href=&quot;#psychology&quot;&gt;psychological benefits&lt;/a&gt; of this concept later, but let me start with explaining the more mechanical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs undeniable that there is &lt;em&gt;some amount&lt;/em&gt; of time required to mentally process/initially-triage emails within your inbox. As you work through your inbox - deleting, archiving, consuming, &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt; - you spend some time on each. By leaving an email in your inbox (rather than taking an action that would remove it from your inbox), you open yourself up to having to mentally re-assess that item as it now lies adjacent to a new (or otherwise un-processed) email that &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; requires fresh review. Rather than forcing yourself to reassess these emails each and every time you check your inbox, simply move them to the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder and then review &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; folder at a less-frequent cadence (more on this interval below!)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder checking frequency&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt;, so let‚Äôs say we are moving things into the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder - how often should we then consult this folder? Ultimately, I believe this would vary from person to person and it in some ways depends on the frequency in which someone generally checks their inbox. I check my inbox multiple times daily, but I only check ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù every couple of days &lt;em&gt;at most&lt;/em&gt;. Here you can immediately see the time savings as I am not needing to review these each and every time I check my inbox! The idea here is to check it at a &lt;em&gt;much less&lt;/em&gt; frequent interval. If you find yourself checking it often and generally taking no actions, you can probably check it &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; frequently! With all this said, there‚Äôs an even better way to deal with most ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù items. (&lt;em&gt;Check out the next bullet&lt;/em&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Later triggers&lt;/strong&gt;: Once we start sticking lots of things in ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù rather than keeping them in the inbox, we could really benefit from a system that helps us remember to review those items while also not necessitating needless checking of each email in that folder when no action is yet needed. So how do we achieve this? Well, in a few ways!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;We previously covered creating corresponding to-do tasks for emails in the &lt;a href=&quot;#taking-action&quot;&gt;taking action&lt;/a&gt; section. If you are leveraging this technique, you can close out ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù email items at the same time you close out to-do items based on your chosen to-do methodology. &lt;em&gt;Sweet!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;As another example, let‚Äôs say you have a ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù email for a delivery you are expecting that you want to make sure you receive. In this case, I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://deliveries.app/en.html&quot;&gt;delivery tracking app&lt;/a&gt; that monitors the progress of my delivery. Once I receive it, I can archive/delete that email in my ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù box.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Essentially&lt;/em&gt;, the idea behind the &lt;em&gt;majority&lt;/em&gt; of ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù items is that there should be an external trigger that fires, reminding you to consult the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù box and ‚Äúclose out‚Äù or make progress towards closure, of the email item.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to take substantive action&lt;/strong&gt;: How do I decide whether to take substantive action vs setting it aside &lt;em&gt;for later&lt;/em&gt;? I don‚Äôt think there is a real amount-of-time threshold for how I decide when to deal with things (the ‚ÄúTwo Minute Rule‚Äù &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; we will &lt;a href=&quot;#psychology&quot;&gt;discuss later&lt;/a&gt; pegs the threshold at, you guessed it! - &lt;em&gt;2 minutes&lt;/em&gt;). For me, this is more of a, &lt;em&gt;what do I feel like doing right now&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;what do I have time to do right now&lt;/em&gt; question. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don‚Äôt leave things in your inbox you will never get to&lt;/strong&gt;! This is a simple axiom. Just get rid of it! (or archive somewhere)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What actually ends up in the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder?&lt;/strong&gt;: This will vary person to person, but for me it‚Äôs things like tracking number emails, online order confirmations, future travel artifacts/events (e.g. flight/excursion confirmations), assorted to-do‚Äôs (that of course have corresponding records in my to-do app), and really any other item that I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I want to get to eventually but don‚Äôt really care when.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When do I leave things in the inbox?&lt;/strong&gt;: In some cases, I leave things in my inbox rather than moving to the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder after triaging. &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt;?? Isn‚Äôt that contrary to what I suggested earlier? &lt;em&gt;Kinda&lt;/em&gt;, but let me explain‚Ä¶ I detailed earlier how items that make their way into the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder are typically tied to a to-do or some other external trigger. Well if there is an item that &lt;em&gt;doesn‚Äôt&lt;/em&gt; have a trigger, or a to-do, and needs to be addressed in relatively short-order, I will sometimes decide to just leave it in my inbox. Alternatively, for items that I want to constantly remind myself of, I leave it in the inbox as my eyes will continually be drawn to it each and every time I check my email.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snoozing&lt;/strong&gt;: One feature that a lot of email providers have adopted is ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7622010&quot;&gt;Snooze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù. This is a very easy way to move an item &lt;em&gt;for later&lt;/em&gt; based on a chosen time-delay. I use this in cases where I know I need to check in on something at a particular date and don‚Äôt want to create a to-do for it instead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;archival-vs-deletion&quot;&gt;Archival vs Deletion&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to provide a quick (list driven, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt;) process flow related to steps &lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt; from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/inbox-zero#lets-zero-it-out&quot;&gt;high-level zero-out playbook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you‚Äôve taken all non-storage/deletion-related actions on an email, follow the following steps for processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you need this email&lt;/strong&gt;? &lt;em&gt;No?&lt;/em&gt; Delete. &lt;em&gt;Yes?&lt;/em&gt; Go to Step 2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I have an existing folder/label that I can archive this email into&lt;/strong&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;? Put email in that folder. &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;? Go to Step 3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it make sense to create a new folder for emails of this type&lt;/strong&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;? Create folder, archive email into the new folder. &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Generically&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6576&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; it rather than deleting it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the final flow of Step 3 is that we can archive things ‚Äúgenerically‚Äù so that we can search for and find things later. By doing so, we do not introduce unnecessary clutter into another folder/label nor will we necessitate the creation of a new folder/label that will never have much in it. &lt;em&gt;Nice&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;email-processing-flow&quot;&gt;Email Process(ing) Flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help illustrate the overall process flow of how I &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; my email, I‚Äôve developed the following diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;psychology&quot;&gt;Psychology&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alright&lt;/em&gt;, assuming you read the &lt;a href=&quot;#practical-mechanics&quot;&gt;previous section&lt;/a&gt;, you now know &lt;em&gt;WAY&lt;/em&gt; more about my e-mail processing workflow than any normal human should. Let‚Äôs now get into &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; managing your email in this way is good for you straight-up &lt;em&gt;emotionally&lt;/em&gt;. This section will introduce a variety of semi-isolated topics, associating well and independently researched scientific studies with the relevant qualities of ‚ÄúInbox Zero‚Äù. &lt;em&gt;Buckle up&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If a cluttered &lt;strike&gt;desk&lt;/strike&gt; inbox is a sign of cluttered mind, of what, then, is an organized &lt;strike&gt;desk&lt;/strike&gt; inbox a sign?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may be familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Kondo&quot;&gt;Marie Kondo&lt;/a&gt;‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://konmari.com/about-the-konmari-method/&quot;&gt;KonMari&lt;/a&gt; method for organization, the main principle being you keep only those things that ‚Äúspark joy‚Äù. I don‚Äôt recommend following this &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; in the context of your email (as there is plenty of email I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; that doesn‚Äôt quite &lt;em&gt;spark joy&lt;/em&gt;) but I think the underlying thought here makes sense. Keep only what you need (or of course, &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt;). For everything else, &lt;strong&gt;delete&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;unsubscribe&lt;/strong&gt;! In this way, you can transform and then live your (digital) life the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second tenant of the &lt;em&gt;KonMari&lt;/em&gt; method is to ensure everything has a place to go. In the context of your email, this means for things you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to keep, make sure they are filed away in an appropriate place. Essentially, this is digital house-keeping. Collectively, this methodology promotes mindfulness, introspection and an eye towards the future. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;2011 Princeton study&lt;/em&gt; titled ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3072218/&quot;&gt;Interactions of Top-Down and Bottom-Up Mechanisms in Human Visual Cortex&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  (&lt;em&gt;inhales&lt;/em&gt;) explains how clutter impairs focus, thus making it more difficult to complete tasks efficiently. I won‚Äôt regurgitate the rather complex science introduced by the research, but what I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say is that when applied to how one might review/process their email, it would follow that by actively reducing the amount of items in your inbox, you can maintain an environment (one with less overall emails) that is scientifically better suited for efficiency/productivity. In other words, even if you can‚Äôt achieve truly &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt; emails (effectively, &lt;em&gt;Inbox Zero&lt;/em&gt;), the sheer fact that you have very few emails in your inbox promotes a more effective working environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Dutch study from 2017&lt;/em&gt; titled ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327022122_Impact_of_cleanliness_on_the_productivity_of_employees&quot;&gt;Impact of cleanliness on the productivity of employees&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; investigates the correlation between cleanliness and productivity. Unsurprisingly, it was found that cleanliness significantly increased perceived productivity and general work satisfaction. This follows with the previously mentioned research &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - having a clean or otherwise organized &lt;em&gt;environment&lt;/em&gt; (whatever that may be) fosters productivity and efficiency! Traditional wisdom suggests that having an organized workstation helps promote productivity. Given our reliance on email as a primary means in which we collaborate and work, it makes sense for us to keep our inbox and other respective email folders clean and tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To wrap up the theme of &lt;strong&gt;organization &amp;amp; cleanliness&lt;/strong&gt; and how it applies to email, consider some of the following statistics on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simplyproductive.com/2012/03/time-management-statistics/&quot;&gt;Organizing &amp;amp; Time Management&lt;/a&gt; gathered by the author of the blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simplyproductive.com/&quot;&gt;Simply Productive&lt;/a&gt;. These stats lay bare the cost of clutter and disorganization.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;One stat describes the amount of time (~150 hours/year) wasted searching for lost information. The National Association of Professional Organizers (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.napo.net&quot;&gt;NAPO&lt;/a&gt;) even claims that on average, we spend one year of our lives looking for lost items. With a properly pruned and sorted email system, you can significantly reduce the time it takes to find things in your email!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Email is increasing in print volume by &lt;strong&gt;40%&lt;/strong&gt;! This is why ruthlessly &lt;em&gt;unsubscribing&lt;/em&gt; is one of the more powerful tools at your disposal.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Using proper organization tools can improve time management by almost 40%. &lt;em&gt;Inbox Zero&lt;/em&gt;, to-do lists, and all the other &lt;a href=&quot;#practical-mechanics&quot;&gt;tactics&lt;/a&gt; described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/tags?tag=inboxzero&quot;&gt;this series&lt;/a&gt; can be certainly be considered as some of these tools.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The benefits of &lt;em&gt;being organized&lt;/em&gt; don‚Äôt end with increased productivity though, there is also very compelling science which points to its stress-reduction qualities as well!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one study, titled ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19934011/&quot;&gt;No place like home: home tours correlate with daily patterns of mood and cortisol&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶‚Äù &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ( &lt;a href=&quot;http://repettilab.psych.ucla.edu/no%20place%20like%20home.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;ph ph-file-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ), the researchers identified a correlation between how individuals described their home, and the severity of depressed mood they experienced. In this experiment, even recounting the general cleanliness/organizational-state of their home proved to be stressful (when the individuals in fact had cluttered homes). What I take away is that people who strive to, and succeed in maintaining an acceptable level of organization/cleanliness will in turn be less stressed! This idea is enforced by a subsequent study, ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494416300159?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;The dark side of home: Assessing possession ‚Äòclutter‚Äô on subjective well-being&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which concludes that clutter has a negative impact on the psychological home and subjective well-being. This is due to our inherent need to identify self with our physical environment, of which a messy or cluttered one does not reflect well. Put it all together and one could surmise that messiness in general, whether it be in an inbox or in the home, can introduce unwanted stress.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saving time&lt;/strong&gt; - which can be achieved through improved &lt;em&gt;efficiency&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1080/01443410.2013.785065&quot;&gt;has been proven to reduce/prevent stress&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we now have the basis for how &lt;em&gt;organization&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;cleanliness&lt;/em&gt; can improve productivity, efficiency and even reduce stress. Let‚Äôs talk about how we apply the psychology of task management / &lt;a href=&quot;https://gettingthingsdone.com/&quot;&gt;GTD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the context of Inbox Zero‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs start with the ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.priorigami.com/blog/the-two-minute-rule&quot;&gt;Two Minute Rule&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, first introduced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_(author)&quot;&gt;David Allen&lt;/a&gt; in ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://gettingthingsdone.com/&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù. The rule simply states, ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;If you can complete a task in less than two minutes, you should just do it&lt;/em&gt;.‚Äù This is a core tenant of the Inbox Zero methodology. &lt;em&gt;Look&lt;/em&gt;, no one loves procrastinating more than me, but by just &lt;em&gt;doing it&lt;/em&gt;, you can clear things out of the inbox (reducing clutter) and start building productive momentum &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by completing the micro-tasks that these emails represent. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, an inbox is really just a list of things &lt;em&gt;to do&lt;/em&gt; (e.g. read, delete, archive, etc‚Ä¶). A lot of peoples inboxes are PACKED, with 10‚Äôs, 100‚Äôs, even &lt;a href=&quot;inbox-zero#title&quot;&gt;1000‚Äôs+&lt;/a&gt; of emails. This is naturally a bit overwhelming. Well David Allen is back with some really great advice on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gettingthingsdone.com/2021/06/are-you-overwhelmed-by-long-lists/&quot;&gt;how to leverage a GTD philosophy to mentally tackle a large list of to-dos&lt;/a&gt;. He condenses the complexities of every day task prioritization into three separate dynamics - &lt;strong&gt;limitations&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;adaptability&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;life purpose&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E.J. Masicampo, a Psychology professor at &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychology.wfu.edu/about-the-department/&quot;&gt;Wake Forest University&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;a href=&quot;http://psychology.wfu.edu/about-the-department/faculty-and-staff/e-j-masicampo/&quot;&gt;documented research&lt;/a&gt; examining the relationship between having too many ‚Äúgoals‚Äù activated within one‚Äôs environment and how that constrains mental faculties. In the context of email / lists in general, he &lt;em&gt;essentially&lt;/em&gt; postulates that by having too many visible to-dos (or things on your list) at one time you compromise your mental effectiveness. He goes on to say that attention can be freed by satisfying ‚Äúactive goals‚Äù, such as through &lt;em&gt;plan making&lt;/em&gt; or goal completion. One way in which to ‚Äúmake plans‚Äù in this context, and in the world of Inbox Zero, is to decompose a more complex task (originating in this case from an email) by creating a series of micro-tasks &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, thus devising a &lt;em&gt;plan&lt;/em&gt; to complete the overall task.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect&quot;&gt;Zeigarnik Effect&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù states that ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;people tend to remember unfinished or incomplete tasks better than completed tasks&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù. This model suggests a key to overcoming procrastination is to simply, &lt;em&gt;just get started&lt;/em&gt;. So by leveraging something like the &lt;strong&gt;Two Minute Rule&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, we can psychologically build productive momentum. Further, the Zeigarnik Effect suggests that mental health improvements can be achieved by &lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; having incomplete items languishing in your to-do list and relatedly, &lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; the sense of accomplishment you get by completing tasks. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, it‚Äôs well understood that when we humans &lt;em&gt;check things off&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://facilethings.com/blog/en/micro-tasks&quot;&gt;our brains release dopamine&lt;/a&gt; that in turn makes us feel, &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;. That satisfaction and sense of accomplishment can have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_effect&quot;&gt;snowball effect&lt;/a&gt;, motivating us to continue completing &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; tasks. By leveraging this simple psychology, we can overcome procrastination by starting small and working our way towards larger and larger tasks. Where a task may be too large and intimidating to begin, consider breaking it into smaller, more atomic micro-tasks, each of which is more easily individually digestable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A word of warning!&lt;/strong&gt;: While leveraging to-do lists and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gettingthingsdone.com/&quot;&gt;GTD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; methodologies has a lot of practical utility, be weary of over-generating to-dos in the name of micro-task-completing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#references&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the way towards developing an &lt;a href=&quot;https://iocdf.org/about-ocd/&quot;&gt;OCD complex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;outro&quot;&gt;Outro&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, how and what you do with your email is somewhat personal and what‚Äôs ‚Äúbest‚Äù for one person will not necessarily be the same for someone else. If you are drowning in email or like the idea of &lt;em&gt;Inbox Zero&lt;/em&gt;, consider this slightly tweaked approach!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ok&lt;/em&gt;, so I realize it‚Äôs less of a &lt;em&gt;logo&lt;/em&gt; and more of a complicated graphic I use as the ‚Äúsplash screen‚Äù of sorts for the site. I understand that logos, generally speaking, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/pro&quot;&gt;far simpler&lt;/a&gt; and this is anything but. &lt;em&gt;In any case&lt;/em&gt;‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs get into it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;inner-space&quot;&gt;Inner Space&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think of the logo in terms of two distinct &lt;em&gt;regions&lt;/em&gt;, the ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;#inner-space&quot;&gt;Inner Space&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù which houses the &lt;a href=&quot;#shellsharks-logo-symbology&quot;&gt;7 individual smaller circular symbols&lt;/a&gt; and the ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;#outer-space&quot;&gt;Outer Space&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù which is essentially the large red ring with the &lt;a href=&quot;#sharks&quot;&gt;3 sharks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#qr&quot;&gt;QR code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#cipher-challenge&quot;&gt;ring of binary characters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cyber-kill-chain&quot;&gt;The Cyber Kill Chain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary inspiration for the symbology in the &lt;a href=&quot;#inner-space&quot;&gt;Inner Space&lt;/a&gt; is Lockheed Martin‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.htm&quot;&gt;Cyber Kill Chain&lt;/a&gt;. Though I know this model has been somewhat deprecated in favor of newer frameworks such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://attack.mitre.org&quot;&gt;MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK&lt;/a&gt;, I still think the &lt;em&gt;Kill Chain&lt;/em&gt; has valuable (albeit more simplistic) applicability. Also, capturing &lt;em&gt;ATT&amp;amp;CK&lt;/em&gt; in a graphic similar to the existing one would be even more insanely complex!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shellsharks-logo-symbology&quot;&gt;Shellsharks Logo Symbology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs walkthrough the sequence of 7 symbols and how they visually represent each phase of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.htm&quot;&gt;Kill Chain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. (&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: You may need to zoom in on the individual icons as we go).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vtl&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;event&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 class=&quot;date&quot; id=&quot;reconnaissance&quot;&gt;Reconnaissance&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;Starting on the left, we see a variety of satellites, satellite dishes and cameras all pointing towards the &lt;a href=&quot;#actions-on-objectives&quot; class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;center circle&lt;/a&gt;. This represents &lt;i&gt;reconnaissance&lt;/i&gt; performed against the target which is, again represented by the center icon. Note how the reconnaissance logo is the first one the &lt;a href=&quot;#sharks&quot; class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;sharks&lt;/a&gt; on the left are swimming to, which is meant to signify that it is the first step for the attacker (i.e. the sharks).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/shellsharks-reconnaissance.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;event&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 class=&quot;date&quot; id=&quot;weaponization&quot;&gt;Weaponization&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;The second circle represents &lt;i&gt;weaponization&lt;/i&gt;. As such, I&apos;ve put a lot of weapon-related icons (e.g. swords, arrows) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Laurel_wreath&quot; class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;military-invoking visuals&lt;/a&gt; into the icon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/shellsharks-weaponization.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;event&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 class=&quot;date&quot; id=&quot;delivery&quot;&gt;Delivery&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;Here we can see a rocket launch, simply depicting payload &lt;i&gt;delivery&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/shellsharks-delivery.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;event&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 class=&quot;date&quot; id=&quot;exploitation&quot;&gt;Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;There is quite a bit of symbology going on in this icon. We have the &lt;i&gt;exploit&lt;/i&gt; &quot;chain&quot; (meant to look like 1&apos;s and 0&apos;s) going around the outside portion of the circle. There is a computer with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken&quot; class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; on it (meant to just be menacing). We are running our exploit (on a Unix-based machine presumably) via &lt;i&gt;./exploit&lt;/i&gt;. Finally, we have a soup of 1&apos;s and 0&apos;s interspersed and spilling out of the logo into the following phase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/shellsharks-exploitation.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;event&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 class=&quot;date&quot; id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;Here we see the stream of 1&apos;s and 0&apos;s from our exploitation phase being piped into the victim computer. The computer has a downward arrow to very plainly represent &lt;i&gt;installation&lt;/i&gt; of malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/shellsharks-installation.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;event&quot; id=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Command &amp;amp; Control (C2)&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;This icon depicts a terminal interacting with a seemingly remote installation (i.e. one on a distant planet). This particular icon I&apos;ve always really loved as it reminds me of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Endor_shield_generator_bunker&quot; class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;Endor shield generator dish&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/&quot; class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/shellsharks-c2.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;event&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3 class=&quot;date&quot; id=&quot;actions-on-objectives&quot;&gt;Actions on Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;txt&quot;&gt;Finally, we have the &quot;&lt;i&gt;Actions on Objectives&lt;/i&gt;&quot; icon. Here we see a road to a building that&apos;s meant to be &quot;Capitol-esque&quot; with fireworks and the letters &quot;DC01&quot; above it. The idea here is that the objective was to capture the DC (i.e. Domain Controller). &lt;i&gt;Basic, I know right&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/shellsharks-actions.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;outer-space&quot;&gt;Outer Space&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we blast into Outer Space (the area of the logo which contains the &lt;a href=&quot;#sharks&quot;&gt;sharks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#qr&quot;&gt;QR code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#cipher-challenge&quot;&gt;enciphered binary ring&lt;/a&gt;)‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;ph ph-rocket-launch lg&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sharks&quot;&gt;Sharks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Threat actors, hackers, red teamers, etc‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/sharks.png&quot; width=&quot;175px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;qr&quot;&gt;QR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scan it (&lt;em&gt;or click&lt;/em&gt;) and find out! Probably not malware‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/qr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/qr.PNG&quot; width=&quot;175px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cipher-challenge&quot;&gt;Cipher Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The binary stream encircling the logo is in fact ciphertext. Older variants of the logo contained clues for decryption. The current logo &lt;em&gt;doesn‚Äôt really&lt;/em&gt;. I should probably add some clues back‚Ä¶ To get ya started, I have provided the ciphertext below. &lt;em&gt;Good luck&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;primarycolor&quot; style=&quot;font-family: &apos;Courier New&apos;; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;01010111 00110110 01000101 01101111&lt;br /&gt;01010101 01101001 01110111 01001110&lt;br /&gt;01100111 01001110 00110111 01000001&lt;br /&gt;01001001 01010000 01010100 01111010&lt;br /&gt;01000100 01011010 01100001 01101100&lt;br /&gt;01110110 01110111 00111101 00111101&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behold&lt;/strong&gt;! The evolution of the logo‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think either of the first two were ever actually on the public site though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;box box1&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/logo-gen1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently re-thought the visuals and content-approach for my professional resume, the outcome of which you can find a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/resume&quot;&gt;digital version of on my site&lt;/a&gt;. The big difference between this &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; approach and the &lt;em&gt;traditional&lt;/em&gt; approach is I have not included the &lt;em&gt;list-of-each-job-in-chronological-order-with-what-I-did-at-each-place&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;stuff&lt;/strong&gt; that you typically see. Instead, I have summarized the projects and skills that best summarize my experience and included an alphabetical list of places I have worked. Let me explain why I don‚Äôt like the traditional approach‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find that the focus being on &lt;strong&gt;where you‚Äôve worked&lt;/strong&gt; as opposed to &lt;em&gt;what your achievements are&lt;/em&gt; is really just a means by which prospective hiring teams can discriminate against you or otherwise discount valuable experience you have because they don‚Äôt like or know the company that that experience was associated with. That‚Äôs not to say that 5 years of experience at Google is the same as 5 years experience at some small company, but in the end, I‚Äôve never been in an actual interview where it‚Äôs seemed like I‚Äôve gotten points based on where I‚Äôve worked in the past. Ultimately, I still needed to prove my knowledge in the interview and that can be done by anyone with the skills/confidence required, not just by those with the ‚Äúbest‚Äù companies listed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total years experience&lt;/strong&gt;. This &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;has always been&lt;/em&gt; a dreadful way of judging someone‚Äôs relative skill. There are &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of 10+ year pros who can‚Äôt do half of what some talented up-starts with 3 years experience can do. In a traditional resume, you have to list time and duration for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt;. This artificial handicap serves only to limit otherwise equally/more-talented younger professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of ‚Äútotal years experience‚Äù, what about having to &lt;strong&gt;include jobs you held 7+ or even 10+ years ago&lt;/strong&gt;? This is often expected / required on traditional resumes but does little to help bolster the way you market yourself. Companies should care about what relevant skills you have, not what you were up to &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; long ago. This serves only as a way for companies to potentially profile or judge you based on what you did in the past. For example, let‚Äôs say you served on a help desk 10 years ago, maybe a company will think negatively of that experience. Why share your entry-level experience when they are looking for what you have done at a more senior level?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project/job held duration&lt;/strong&gt;. This is one of my &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; favorite things that is expected on traditional resumes. The point here I guess is that companies want to know if you‚Äôre some sort of serial job hopper. But there are &lt;em&gt;LOTS&lt;/em&gt; of reasons to leave a job, many of which do not or &lt;em&gt;should not&lt;/em&gt; reflect poorly on a prospective candidate. But, despite this, I think most prospective hiring panels see short stints on a resume and think the worst, even in areas (DC metro anyone?) where short-term consulting gigs are not only common, but potentially the norm!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of having to conform to this exact resume format, why not market yourself how &lt;em&gt;YOU&lt;/em&gt; want to market yourself? Traditional resume formats are designed to put &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; at a disadvantage, revealing everything about yourself while the company has to reveal nothing about itself. Does the company you‚Äôre applying for have to reveal everyone it has fired and why? Does it have to reveal past or future lay-off plans? Though some companies are more transparent than others, all of them - and I mean 100% of them reveal less about themselves to a prospective employee as you must divulge to them. A background check is a good example of this, when‚Äôs the last time you ran a background check on a company? We, as a society of professionals need to change our mindset on resumes, and begin to collectively accept non-standard resume formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;ph ph-lightning lg&quot; style=&quot;color:yellow; margin: 0 auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;containbox&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update as of January 30, 2025:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Given the current state of things with Tesla, and more specifically, with its owner, I felt compelled to add a quick note here. I still love EVs, and I think... despite everything, that Teslas are \*still\* great cars. BUT! I wouldn&apos;t recommend you buy one, not anymore. I also want to emphatically state that what Elon has chosen to stand for, is anti- &lt;b&gt;everything&lt;/b&gt; I stand for.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;, that is a poem about a review about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;, I‚Äôm not ashamed of this. As you may be able to tell, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/about?about=tesla&quot;&gt;I‚Äôm a big fan of Tesla&lt;/a&gt;! I‚Äôve been a Tesla EVangelist for years and have answered many a question during that time. And though there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://theicct.org/publications/ev-update-us-cities-aug2020&quot;&gt;far more EV‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;especially Teslas&lt;/em&gt;) on the road now than there were 3 years ago when I took delivery of my Model 3, I still see a lot of the same questions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt&quot;&gt;FUD&lt;/a&gt; and unquenched curiosity. This piece is designed to address these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically though, this is a review of my (2018) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/model3&quot;&gt;Model 3&lt;/a&gt;, which I&apos;ve newly renamed &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color:yellow;&quot;&gt;Thundermage&lt;/span&gt;&quot; in honor of this review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first section, I will answer the most common questions I am asked about Tesla and EV‚Äôs in general. I‚Äôll also address some common misconceptions. For other information, check out Tesla‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/support/new-owner-frequently-asked-questions&quot;&gt;new owner FAQ&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-i-charge-it&quot;&gt;How do I charge it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla provides a relatively &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/charging&quot;&gt;comprehensive guide&lt;/a&gt; to charging on their site. In that guide, they discuss &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/home-charging&quot;&gt;home charging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/destination-charging&quot;&gt;destination charging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/supercharger&quot;&gt;supercharging&lt;/a&gt;. The bottom line is, you have &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of options when it comes to charging. I‚Äôll dive into these options below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;120v outlet&lt;/strong&gt; : &lt;em&gt;Yep&lt;/em&gt;! You can charge on a standard wall outlet, and many people go this route for their primary, every-day charging solution! &lt;a href=&quot;#how-fast-does-it-charge&quot;&gt;Charge times&lt;/a&gt; are a little slower but it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get the job done, especially if you have all night to juice up. This is great when you think about it because outlets such as these are pretty ubiquitous. Anywhere where you can charge your phone, you can charge your car! At your grandma‚Äôs house? Plug it in! At an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com&quot;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Plug it in&lt;/em&gt;! You can charge this thing anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, all Teslas come with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.tesla.com/product/gen-2-mobile-connector-bundle&quot;&gt;Mobile Connector Bundle&lt;/a&gt; which includes the 120v outlet adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla Wall Connector&lt;/strong&gt; : For home charging, Tesla‚Äôs (&lt;em&gt;and my&lt;/em&gt;) recommended method is the Tesla &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.tesla.com/product/wall-connector?tesref=true&quot;&gt;Wall Connector&lt;/a&gt;. At $500 it‚Äôs a little pricey, but if you‚Äôve purchased a $50,000 car that &lt;em&gt;relies on being charged&lt;/em&gt;, I think the investment is worth it. I also recommend getting the longer cable (18‚Äô) as it gives you a little additional versatility. For help installing the unit (and I strongly recommend getting professional help), Tesla has provided a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/support/find-electrician&quot;&gt;resource to find licensed electricians&lt;/a&gt; that can take on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;240v outlet&lt;/strong&gt; : If you want a little faster charging but don‚Äôt want to fully commit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.tesla.com/product/wall-connector?tesref=true&quot;&gt;Tesla‚Äôs Wall Connector&lt;/a&gt;, the 240v outlet is likely the way to go. Typically seen in garages for use with a refrigerator or laundry machine, this is a good EV-agnostic way to get faster charging speeds. In other words, the 240v outlet is a good option if you don‚Äôt want to spend the extra $$ on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.tesla.com/product/wall-connector?tesref=true&quot;&gt;Wall Connector&lt;/a&gt; or if you plan on having a non-Tesla EV.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Destination Charger&lt;/strong&gt; : So you won‚Äôt always be able to charge at home, so what are your options when out on the road? Well it turns out, there are a TON - and not just bumming small amounts of charge off of random 120v outlets either. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/destination-charging&quot;&gt;Destination Charging&lt;/a&gt; - from hotels to restaurants to resorts, destination charging is available at over 4500 sites (and counting). Destination charging is typically on par-with or close-to what you get out of a Tesla Wall Connector or standard 240 outlet. I‚Äôve even found plenty of destination charging that is offered completely for free. What‚Äôs better than free fuel!?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For other destination charging, Tesla themselves recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plugshare.com/&quot;&gt;Plughsare.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC Fast Charger&lt;/strong&gt; : Though I haven‚Äôt used one of these myself (thanks to Tesla‚Äôs Supercharger network being so robust), Teslas are also capable of utilizing third-party DC fast charging networks such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.electrifyamerica.com&quot;&gt;Electrify America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.evgo.com&quot;&gt;EVgo&lt;/a&gt;. All you‚Äôll need is the $400 &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.tesla.com/product/chademo-adapter.&quot;&gt;CHAdeMO Adapter&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;ouch!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla Supercharger&lt;/strong&gt; : Saving the best for last, there is Tesla‚Äôs incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/supercharger&quot;&gt;Supercharger&lt;/a&gt; network. This network represents the largest collection of fast-chargers in the world and they are designed and made available exclusively to Teslas (&lt;a href=&quot;tesla opening up superchargers&quot;&gt;for now&lt;/a&gt;). This is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; primary means for charging while on road trips. It‚Äôs fast, convenient and with 25000+ stalls world-wide, available pretty much no matter where you are. Superchargers are typically located in parking lots within shopping areas so you can grab food, use the restroom or stay somewhat entertained while you charge up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-fast-does-it-charge&quot;&gt;How fast does it charge?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charging speeds are typically separated into three categories, &lt;strong&gt;L1-L3&lt;/strong&gt;. These categories are described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L1&lt;/strong&gt; : This typically means the standard 120v outlets. You can expect anywhere from 3-5 miles/hour on average. For a car that needs 300 miles range, this means a charge time of 60-100 hours to charge from zero to full. A little slow but will work in many situations where you only need to get 50 miles or so with an overnight charge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L2&lt;/strong&gt; : Level 2 charging includes 240v outlets, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation/wall-connector&quot;&gt;Wall Connectors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/destination-charging&quot;&gt;Destination Charging&lt;/a&gt;. L2 will typically net you around 25-45 miles/hour. A zero-to-full charge session would thus take you anywhere from 7-12 hours. Perfect for overnight charging. &lt;em&gt;I should mention though that the top-end of L2 charging (approx. 44 miles/hour) is obtained by using the Tesla &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation/wall-connector&quot;&gt;Wall Connector&lt;/a&gt; with 48 amp output.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L3&lt;/strong&gt; : Finally, we have the top end charging, Level 3. For Teslas, this typically means &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/supercharger&quot;&gt;Superchargers&lt;/a&gt;, but would also include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chargepoint.com/blog/when-and-how-use-dc-fast-charging/&quot;&gt;DC Fast Chargers&lt;/a&gt;. To answer, ‚Äúhow fast does a Supercharger charge‚Äù though is a little trickier to answer. Current-gen, ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging&quot;&gt;V3&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù Superchargers can charge at speeds of up to 1000 miles/hour. Wow! But those speeds are only obtained at certain Superchargers and when the vehicle‚Äôs state-of-charge (SoC) is low. When actively charging, as the battery is closer to max capacity, charging speeds dip. Rather than give you numbers here, I can say that anecdotally, while on my road trips, I stop every 2 hours or so to stretch my legs or use the restroom and in that time I plug the car in. After 10-15 minutes, I return to the car with more than enough juice to get to the next stop. This is the recommended approach for road-tripping in a Tesla. &lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: Having never used a ‚ÄúDC Fast Charger‚Äù, I really can‚Äôt speak to it‚Äôs charging speeds. Sorry!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-does-it-cost-to-charge&quot;&gt;How much does it cost to charge?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This depends where you charge, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.electricchoice.com/electricity-prices-by-state/&quot;&gt;price of electricity&lt;/a&gt; during the time/region you are charging. But to give you an example, I pulled some numbers from my own home charging. Based on my last electric bill, I am on-average billed $.13/kWh. The Tesla Model 3‚Äôs battery pack is a 75 kWh pack (&lt;a href=&quot;https://electrek.co/2020/11/10/tesla-model-3-82-kwh-battery-pack-new-cells/&quot;&gt;newer packs have more kWh&lt;/a&gt;). This means it costs $9.75, or about $10, to charge the pack from zero to full. On that 75 kWh, my car gets about 300 miles. So let‚Äôs say 10$ will get you 300 miles range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let‚Äôs take a traditional &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine&quot;&gt;ICE&lt;/a&gt; car, like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toyota.com/corolla/&quot;&gt;Toyota Corolla&lt;/a&gt;. With a 13.2 gallon tank and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gasprices.aaa.com&quot;&gt;gas prices&lt;/a&gt; hovering around $3/gallon, it costs about $40 for a full tank. With approximately 400 miles range, we can take 75% of both the range and that cost and come up with a value of $30 to go an equivalent 300 miles in the Corolla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we end up with is a difference in price for home-charging the Tesla at &lt;strong&gt;1/3 the price of gas&lt;/strong&gt; as compared with the Corolla for the same amount of miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now many also ask about the price of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/supercharger&quot;&gt;Supercharging&lt;/a&gt;. The cost of Supercharging is about 2x the cost of home charging, typically around $.26-$.28/kWh (&lt;em&gt;compared to the $.13/kWH I was getting at home&lt;/em&gt;). Doubling the cost of electricity still leaves you with a final cost of &lt;strong&gt;2/3 the amount of gas&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will add that the numbers I used for home charging were based on &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; cost of electricity during a one month span. It is important to note that charging your car in off-peak hours will result in cheaper costs per kWh. So if you are home-charging in the dead of night, it will actually be even &lt;em&gt;cheaper&lt;/em&gt; than calculated to juice up the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-kind-of-range-does-it-have&quot;&gt;What kind of range does it have?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first took delivery of my car, it was rated at &lt;strong&gt;310 miles&lt;/strong&gt; of range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, three years into ownership and after a full charge, my car normally reports that I have about 290 miles range. This &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be due in part to &lt;a href=&quot;https://electrek.co/2020/06/06/tesla-battery-degradation-replacement/&quot;&gt;battery degradation&lt;/a&gt;, but I know from speaking with Tesla engineers that it is more likely due (in large part) to the way Tesla calculates range. Essentially, the car will determine range based off my normal efficiency, i.e. the way I typically drive. In other words, since I tend to drive somewhat, &lt;em&gt;spirited&lt;/em&gt;, the car adjusts my range calculation to take into account the lower efficiency. &lt;em&gt;Neat&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-i-get-into-or-out-of-the-car&quot;&gt;How do I get into or out of the car?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn‚Äôt a question I get, but it always seems to be a challenge for people when first learning how to get in and out of a Model 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icNLL8j4J_k&quot;&gt;Unlocking/Getting into a Model 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMzejxP_9x4&quot;&gt;Getting out of a Model 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-i-get-stuck&quot;&gt;Will I get stuck?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_anxiety&quot;&gt;Range anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and uncertainty around how and where to charge is by far the biggest fear amongst prospective EV purchasers. And though Teslas and similar EVs have really good range (250+ miles), driving long distances is, in reality, not as simple as just getting in your car and going. There is &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; level of planning that should go into your drive. In a Tesla, this can be calculated for you by the onboard computer. It will plan your route and give you all the places you should stop to charge. It bases this on a number of factors including distance, elevation gain, temperature and more. What‚Äôs important to take away is that you really need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/trips&quot;&gt;plan your route&lt;/a&gt; and understand where you would like to stop. When driving along major throughways, you can generally count on there being charging &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/findus?v=2&amp;amp;bounds=63.232619366399604%2C-40.511719937500004%2C5.176252916331986%2C-158.0214855625&amp;amp;zoom=4&amp;amp;filters=store%2Cservice%2Csupercharger%2Cdestination%20charger%2Cbodyshop&quot;&gt;every 50 miles or so&lt;/a&gt; though. In this case, less planning may be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evs-arent-any-more-green-than-gas-cars&quot;&gt;EVs aren‚Äôt any more green than gas cars.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common argument amongst EV-haters is that EVs are no more eco-friendly than gas cars because the way the electricity that is used to charge the car is sourced is not-in-fact ‚Äúgreen‚Äù. &lt;strong&gt;This is not accurate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Quick Study&lt;/strong&gt;: Using the EPA‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/egrid/power-profiler&quot;&gt;Power Profiler&lt;/a&gt; I can get an idea of my carbon emissions based on the number of kWh I consume in a year in my region (SRVC). Estimating 15000 miles of driving distance with my car that has about 300 miles range, that comes to about 50 complete zero-to-full fill-ups. With a 75 kWh battery pack, this means a total of 3750 kWh of electricity used for charging in a year or 312.50 kWh/month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the Power Profiler there is an Emissions Estimate function which can take a monthly kWh value and calculate an annual emissions rate based on your particular eGRID subregion (mine is SRVC - SERC Virginia/Carolina). With a usage of approx. 313 kWh/month, my annual estimated emissions is 2,928 pounds CO2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt;, so now let‚Äôs use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=4&quot;&gt;carbonfootprint.com calculator&lt;/a&gt; to determine the annual CO2 emissions for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toyota.com/corolla/&quot;&gt;Toyota Corolla&lt;/a&gt;. Using the calculator, I plug in 15k miles, the 2020 Toyota Corolla CVT 2WD (which according to this calculator has an efficiency score of 165.363) and I end up with an annual emissions value of 3.99 metric tons or about 8,000 pounds CO2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the Corolla produces about 2.66x more carbon emissions than the Tesla. &lt;em&gt;Not good&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;positives&quot;&gt;Positives&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I‚Äôve said, I love my Tesla, and there are &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many reasons why. I‚Äôve tried to compile these reasons here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#how-do-i-charge-it&quot;&gt;Charging at home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; : Never having to go to a gas station is really one of my favorite perks of the car. You get to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-ev-memes-win-skeptics-gas-crisis/&quot;&gt;laugh smugly&lt;/a&gt; as you drive past the sad folk putting stinky dinosaur juice into their cars. Plus, you‚Äôll always have a ‚Äúfull tank‚Äù, or as much juice as you need (as long as you remember to plug it in) thanks to the ability to charge at home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electricity is cheaper than gas&lt;/strong&gt; : Mile for mile, electricity is on average &lt;a href=&quot;#how-much-does-it-cost-to-charge&quot;&gt;much cheaper than gas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Oh&lt;/em&gt;, and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/destination-charging&quot;&gt;many places&lt;/a&gt; where you can charge completely for free - try getting free gas anywhere! Features like &lt;em&gt;scheduled departure&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;scheduled charging&lt;/em&gt; can help get the most cost-efficient home charging as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It‚Äôs fast&lt;/strong&gt; : My car (Model 3 Dual Motor) goes 0-60 in about 4 seconds. Even after three years, I still find that punch to be pretty exhilarating. That speed isn‚Äôt just for fun though, being able to quickly position yourself is a highly practical feature, especially when merging on highways.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very bright headlights&lt;/strong&gt; : I don‚Äôt like driving at night. The headlights on my car makes it a lot more bearable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The glass roof is cool&lt;/strong&gt; : The glass roof not only looks great but gives the inside of the car a very open feeling. I also love to watch planes as they fly overhead or look at the towering trees/buildings when I am in a wooded or city area. (&lt;em&gt;All of course while I‚Äôm not driving&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frunk space&lt;/strong&gt; : Where a gas car normally has an engine, a Tesla has a storage area known as the ‚ÄúFrunk‚Äù! Who wouldn‚Äôt appreciate having a little additional storage space?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handles wind well&lt;/strong&gt; : What I mean here is that even in heavy cross-winds, this car feels incredibly stable. The weight of the car, low center of gravity and the (short) height of the car are primary contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The display&lt;/strong&gt; : The 15‚Äù screen is not only hyper-versatile, it also looks really really cool. Navigation is huge, gaming and other entertainment looks great, it‚Äôs just a really nice experience. The screen takes the place of the traditional instrument cluster. What this means is that your speed gauge is on the screen which is to the right of you rather than directly behind the wheel. Some people fear that this will inhibit them from being able to see their speed as easily. I find that it is just as easy if not easier to see it in large print on the huge screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purchase experience&lt;/strong&gt; : &lt;em&gt;No contest here&lt;/em&gt;. Buying a car with a few clicks online is infinitely better than going into a dealership. You can even use &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/03/19/tesla-apple-pay-model-3-reservations/&quot;&gt;Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eco-friendly&lt;/strong&gt; : As discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;#evs-arent-any-more-green-than-gas-cars&quot;&gt;the section above&lt;/a&gt;, this car will produce less carbon emissions than a traditional ICE car. What‚Äôs not to like about that? Especially considering the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/07/14/western-heat-wave-rockies/&quot;&gt;insane heat wave&lt;/a&gt; the US has been experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#what-kind-of-range-does-it-have&quot;&gt;Range is superb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; : At 300+ miles, my car has more than enough range for any trip I have thrown at it. Sure, it‚Äôs not as much raw range as some equivalent gas cars, but I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; drive 300+ miles in one sitting, so getting to stop and charge up is always a nice respite from sitting in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supercharger network is great&lt;/strong&gt; : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/supercharger&quot;&gt;Superchargers&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/findus?v=2&amp;amp;bounds=63.232619366399604%2C-40.511719937500004%2C5.176252916331986%2C-158.0214855625&amp;amp;zoom=4&amp;amp;filters=store%2Cservice%2Csupercharger%2Cdestination%20charger%2Cbodyshop&quot;&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt;! They are typically found in shopping centers so you have access to food and more while charging. Supercharging is cheaper than gas and in my experience (driving on the East Coast), I have never had to wait for a spot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low maintenance&lt;/strong&gt; : Tesla‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/support/car-maintenance&quot;&gt;guidance on maintenance&lt;/a&gt; is very simple. From this guide, there really isn‚Äôt that much that goes into taking care of the car! In the three years I‚Äôve owned the car, I‚Äôve only taken it into the dealership once (a few days after taking delivery to fix a few small aesthetic things). What‚Äôs even better is that when you do have an issue with the car, it‚Äôs highly likely that Tesla will be able to send a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/support/mobile-service&quot;&gt;Mobile Service&lt;/a&gt; vehicle to you which can resolve your maintenance issue without you ever having to leave your house. &lt;em&gt;Awesome&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regenerative braking&lt;/strong&gt; : Arguably the biggest difference in driving an EV versus driving a traditional ICE car is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://driving.ca/column/how-it-works/how-it-works-regenerative-braking&quot;&gt;regenerative braking&lt;/a&gt;. Once you‚Äôre used to it though, I think it offers a superior and far less exhausting driving experience. Essentially, regen-braking allows you to never really have to take your foot completely off the accelerator and put it on your brake. Over the course of a long drive, your feet and legs are less tired without the constant moving and placing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very safe &amp;amp; secure vehicle&lt;/strong&gt; : All Teslas are extremely safe cars. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings&quot;&gt;NHTSA&lt;/a&gt; consistently scores Teslas at 5-stars across the board in their crash-safety tests. Tesla scores so well for a few reasons. First, Teslas are very hard to roll - their low center-of-gravity thanks to the very heavy battery pack in the floor of the car helps contribute to this. Second, with no gas motor, there is less risk of fire/explosion in the event of a crash, plus, the lack of the motor in the front allows the front to be a crumple zone. Finally, Teslas come with a lot of cool, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/support/car-safety-security-features&quot;&gt;advanced security features&lt;/a&gt; standard. Things like the Dashcam, cabin camera, security alarm, pin to drive, sentry mode, intrusion sensors, auto lane adjust, obstacle aware braking, etc‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onboard Dashcam&lt;/strong&gt; : Though i‚Äôve just mentioned the Dashcam, it‚Äôs worth mentioning again. Having a built in Dashcam which captures not only the view out of the front of the car but also the sides is really cool and very useful in the event of an accident. What‚Äôs better, you can view Dashcam footage right inside the car on the huge screen. &lt;em&gt;Amazing&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control with your phone&lt;/strong&gt; : Being able to control the car with my phone is great. I hate carrying keys and now I don‚Äôt have to! I can control climate, charging, trunk/frunk, windows, and even request service all from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tesla/id582007913&quot;&gt;Tesla app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make‚Äôs fart noises&lt;/strong&gt; : There‚Äôs a built-in &lt;a href=&quot;https://electrek.co/2021/01/19/how-to-make-your-tesla-fart/&quot;&gt;whoopie cushion&lt;/a&gt;. Hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt; : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/event/experience-tesla-arcade&quot;&gt;Tesla Arcade&lt;/a&gt; includes a number of games including Polytopia, Cat Quest, Fallout Shelter, Stardew Valley, CupHead, BeachBuggy Racing 2, backgammon, solitaire, chess and a bunch of Atari-classics including 2048, Asteroids, Centipede, Super Breakout, Lunar Lander, Missile Command, Millipede, Tempest and Gravitar. &lt;em&gt;Phew!&lt;/em&gt; These games are playable via the touch screen, the steering wheel and even via a classic game controller such as an Xbox or Playstation controller. &lt;em&gt;So fun&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entertainment&lt;/strong&gt; : As long as you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/support/connectivity&quot;&gt;Premium Connectivity&lt;/a&gt;, you can enjoy a number of other entertainment options in the car. Netflix, Twitch, Hulu and Youtube are some of the available options at this time. This isn‚Äôt a feature I use much, but when I do need it, it makes sitting in the car really great.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTA updates&lt;/strong&gt; : A lot of the software-enabled features I have mentioned in this section are things that the car did not originally ship with. Rather, they are features that have been added to the car, &lt;em&gt;all for free&lt;/em&gt;. This includes everything from Dashcam to Sentry Mode to Tesla Arcade to the entertainment features. My car has even had improved acceleration pushed to it via software based optimizations. Truly incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;negatives&quot;&gt;Negatives&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I love my car, it isn‚Äôt perfect. There are a number of things I wish we‚Äôre different or that are just bad. I‚Äôve listed these below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AC unit is a little weak&lt;/strong&gt; : I find that the onboard Tesla AC unit is a bit weak. It doesn‚Äôt ever seem to get as cold or as hot as I‚Äôd like it to and it doesn‚Äôt seem to cool or heat very quickly. Compared to my old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toyota.com/corolla/&quot;&gt;Toyota Corolla&lt;/a&gt;, it definitely falls short. You don‚Äôt really want to lose to a Toyota Corolla.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not a hatchback&lt;/strong&gt; : My biggest gripe with this car after 3 years is the trunk. It‚Äôs actually quite roomy but really, I wish it was a hatchback. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/modely&quot;&gt;Model Y&lt;/a&gt; has this feature and it‚Äôs much better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EV tax credit has expired&lt;/strong&gt; : The $7500 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxevb.shtml&quot;&gt;federal tax credit&lt;/a&gt; for EVs has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.taxwarriors.com/blog/electric-vehicle-tax-credit-explained-tesla-no-longer-eligible&quot;&gt;run out&lt;/a&gt; for Tesla. At the time I bought my car, I actually got the full amount. But for those looking to purchase a Tesla these days, you won‚Äôt get any help from the federal government. With that said, there are other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/support/incentives&quot;&gt;state/local incentives&lt;/a&gt; to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charging on 120v is slow&lt;/strong&gt; : Though charging on 120v is really cool and a very useful feature, it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it is &lt;a href=&quot;#how-fast-does-it-charge&quot;&gt;very slow&lt;/a&gt;. If you only have an over-night to charge or need to charge up quickly, you‚Äôre going to be disappointed relying on 120v.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-park does not come standard&lt;/strong&gt; : The self-parking feature is bundled with the exorbitantly expensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/autopilot&quot;&gt;FSD package&lt;/a&gt;. I think this is ridiculous. Self-parking has been a feature of far less advanced cars for a long time. I really wish this came standard or was bundled with some other sort of much cheaper premium upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horn is difficult to trigger&lt;/strong&gt; : Maybe i‚Äôm just too gentle with my car, but I always find when I try to honk I‚Äôm either not pressing the right spot, or I am not smashing the wheel hard enough. I wish there was just a button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engaging windshield wipers is not ideal&lt;/strong&gt; : A couple issues with the windshield wipers. First, the rain-sensing auto-wipers do not work very well. I find that they either don‚Äôt wipe fast enough, fail to wipe at all or wipe when it‚Äôs not really needed. Tesla is apparently attacking this problem with‚Ä¶ a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tesla-info.com/blog/tesla-deep-rain.php&quot;&gt;neural net solution&lt;/a&gt;? Second, engaging the wipers is a little clunky and non-ideal. You can click the button at the tip of the left wheel stalk to invoke a single wipe, at which point the modal for the wiper speed is brought up on-screen. From there, you must look down and press the speed you‚Äôd like the wipers to be at. This isn‚Äôt great since typically when you are needing the wipers, especially at a higher speed, it is raining and not the best time to take your eyes of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning radius isn‚Äôt great&lt;/strong&gt; : Compared to my old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toyota.com/corolla/&quot;&gt;Toyota Corolla&lt;/a&gt;, I find that the Model 3 has a really bad turning radius.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tires wear quickly&lt;/strong&gt; : You‚Äôll find that &lt;em&gt;spirited driving&lt;/em&gt; is a common occurrence with a Tesla. This tends to wear the tires down quicker. This means more $$ for new tires.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People will try to race you&lt;/strong&gt; : It could be that I‚Äôm just hyper-sensitive to people accelerating off the line, but I always get the sense that people want to race me. The good news is, I always win =).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premium connectivity costs extra&lt;/strong&gt; : If you want live traffic, video/music streaming or internet browsing capability, you‚Äôll need to subscribe to Tesla‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/support/connectivity&quot;&gt;Premium Connectivity&lt;/a&gt; at $9.99/month. This isn‚Äôt ideal, but i rarely use any of those features outside of live traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;other-neutral-stuff&quot;&gt;Other, Neutral Stuff&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the good and the bad, there are the things that just, &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;. I list these ‚Äúneutral‚Äù items below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warranty&lt;/strong&gt; : Tesla has what I consider to be a pretty good warranty. The warranty is described as follows‚Ä¶ Basic Vehicle - 4 years or 50,000 mi, whichever comes first + Battery &amp;amp; Drive Unit - 8 years or 120,000 mi, whichever comes first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap Up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs amazing to see Elon‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me&quot;&gt;master plan&lt;/a&gt; for Tesla come to life, I really do believe what he has created is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1068215834877685760&quot;&gt;most fun you could possibly have in a car&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alright!&lt;/em&gt; That‚Äôs the end of the ‚ÄúRevue‚Äù. I thank you for reading and I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback. Are you planning on ordering a Tesla? If so, please use my &lt;a href=&quot;https://ts.la/michael65140&quot;&gt;referral code&lt;/a&gt;! Agree or disagree with any of the points I made? &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/contact&quot;&gt;Let me know about it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I highly recommend you check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s&quot;&gt;this amazing comic/review&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoatmeal.com/&quot;&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;. It does a better job than I ever could of summing up the real magic of owning a Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why I Blog. You Should Too!</title>
        <shark:summary><p><strong>You should start a blog</strong>. If you disagree, I certainly understand the hesitancy. I was once like you! I‚Äôm here to convince you otherwise. I‚Äôll start with a short tale about the <a href="/blogging-from-ipad#title">inception of shellsharks</a> and the <a href="https://shellsharks.com/about?about=blog">unsuccessful blogging attempts</a> which preceded it.</p>
</shark:summary>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should start a blog&lt;/strong&gt;. If you disagree, I certainly understand the hesitancy. I was once like you! I‚Äôm here to convince you otherwise. I‚Äôll start with a short tale about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/blogging-from-ipad#title&quot;&gt;inception of shellsharks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/about?about=blog&quot;&gt;unsuccessful blogging attempts&lt;/a&gt; which preceded it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;historical-context&quot;&gt;Historical Context&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/&quot;&gt;shellsharks&lt;/a&gt; site in mid-2019. At that time, I had but two ideas for topics to write about - a ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/getting-into-information-security#title&quot;&gt;Getting Into Infosec&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù guide and an idea to catalog all of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/designer-vulnerabilities#title&quot;&gt;‚Äúnamed‚Äù vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartbleed.com&quot;&gt;Heartbleed&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù). Prior to 2019, I tried at least two other times to blog or otherwise ‚Äúwrite‚Äù, both of which fizzled out before I got to a second post. At the time, I blamed this on the &lt;a href=&quot;#what-not-to-worry-about&quot;&gt;usual reasons&lt;/a&gt; - not enough time, didn‚Äôt know what to write about, couldn‚Äôt find my ‚Äúniche‚Äù, etc‚Ä¶ What I failed to realize then are &lt;a href=&quot;#so-why-blog&quot;&gt;a number of things&lt;/a&gt; I fully appreciate today, and I‚Äôd like to share those with you. Let me start with what &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to worry about when starting a blog‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-not-to-worry-about&quot;&gt;What Not To Worry About&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section is a list of common concerns &amp;amp; fears people have when faced with the thought of starting a blog. Many of these slowed me down &lt;a href=&quot;#historical-context&quot;&gt;in the beginning&lt;/a&gt; but I am here to tell you, &lt;em&gt;don‚Äôt worry about it&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don‚Äôt know how to host a blog&lt;/strong&gt; : This is an easy fix and it is only a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/?q=how+to+host+a+blog&quot;&gt;Google search&lt;/a&gt; away! You have plenty of options too, with varying degrees of complexity. Sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; can make it easy to get started, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly popular and has plenty of advanced functionality as well as for-beginners templates and tutorials, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/blogging-from-ipad#hosting&quot;&gt;which I personally use&lt;/a&gt;) can help you host a blog directly out of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; account! There are countless other means too. The important takeaway is that it is &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; to start, you need only contend with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overchoice&quot;&gt;overchoice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don‚Äôt know which blog hosting provider is best&lt;/strong&gt; : This is a classic road block. You know you want to start a blog but get bogged down in picking the best hosting provider or the best of whatever else. Don‚Äôt sweat this too much. Do a little research and pick one that fits most of your needs. If you need to change to a different provider, it‚Äôs easy enough to do. Focus more on getting to the point where you can actually publish content. In the end, your content is mostly text and images, this can be ported anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No one will read my blog&lt;/strong&gt; : Will you become a well-known blogger? Statistically speaking, probably not. Will &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; read what you put on the Internet? Statistically speaking, &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt;! The Internet is vast, and even the most remote corners are accessed. But you don‚Äôt have to write for anyone else. &lt;em&gt;Write for you&lt;/em&gt;! Your experiences matter and documenting them for your own historical purpose is a good enough reason to start. I had similar concerns when I started my site but I have found, over time, that people &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; interested. People will &lt;em&gt;inevitably&lt;/em&gt; find and read what you have to say. People will even eventually comment or give you feedback! That feedback may also even be positive! Whether people read it or not is inconsequential. There are &lt;a href=&quot;#so-why-blog&quot;&gt;plenty of benefits&lt;/a&gt; regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don‚Äôt have anything to write about&lt;/strong&gt; - You write about what you are interested in, working on or generally doing. Unless you are interested in / working on / doing &lt;em&gt;NOTHING&lt;/em&gt;, you will always have material!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I publish will be bad or uninteresting&lt;/strong&gt; : This could only possibly be true if you write about something that no one else is interested in or that no one else is working on something related to. In a world with close to 5 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; Internet users, I doubt you are writing about anything that is &lt;em&gt;THAT&lt;/em&gt; niche. In other words, there are like-minded folks out there. They want to read what you have to say. If you‚Äôre worried you aren‚Äôt a strong writer, don‚Äôt worry, you can get better. Everyone starts somewhere. Say what you want to say in the way you say it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have nothing novel to contribute&lt;/strong&gt; : I write &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; about infosec topics. You know who else does that? Lots of people. Like, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/infosec-blogs#title&quot;&gt;so many people&lt;/a&gt;. It didn‚Äôt deter me, nor did it deter all of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; awesome creators. It shouldn‚Äôt deter you either. Even if it‚Äôs been said before, it hasn‚Äôt been said in the way you‚Äôre going to say it. People benefit from different perspectives on the same thing. People also benefit from the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; perspective on the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don‚Äôt have a niche&lt;/strong&gt; : You don‚Äôt need one! Write about whatever you want, as broadly as you want. &lt;em&gt;Sure&lt;/em&gt;, some may advise that by writing across a broad range of topics you run the risk of alienating some of your potential readership that would only be interested in your core topics. This &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be true, but the way I consume content from blogs is by &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/an-ode-to-rss#how-to-rss&quot;&gt;scrolling through a feed&lt;/a&gt; of blogs I follow - if the post looks interesting to me, I read it. Otherwise, I scroll past. In other words, unless I am absolutely &lt;em&gt;spammed&lt;/em&gt; with content unrelated to what I am interested in, I wouldn‚Äôt unsubscribe from a blog which had previously posted content I was interested in. I‚Äôll add that people in general have broad interests. If you write broadly, you will reach a larger audience. I for example write about &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/tags?tag=infosec&quot;&gt;infosec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/tags?tag=technology&quot;&gt;non-infosec-tech stuff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/tags?tag=life&quot;&gt;life in general&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I‚Äôm not an expert&lt;/strong&gt; : You don‚Äôt need to be. A lot of people aren‚Äôt ‚Äúexperts‚Äù. That perspective is not only valuable, it‚Äôs also more &lt;em&gt;relatable&lt;/em&gt;. You don‚Äôt need to pass yourself off as the authority on a subject. Simply explain who you are, what your experience is and then write about your topic from your perspective. You will likely find that people can learn more from someone who is in a similar situation as them then from some expert who might not understand how a non-expert thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I say something incorrect or it isn‚Äôt written perfectly?&lt;/strong&gt; : Perfection is the enemy of productivity. Don‚Äôt worry about being flawless, and don‚Äôt sweat the times you are incorrect. With any luck, someone will call you out on something you post that‚Äôs wrong and you will have a chance to learn from that mistake and you can update the post at that time! No one knows everything, not even the big names in your given industry or field. It‚Äôs ok to be wrong, and it‚Äôs also OK to change your mind, update/fix your content, etc‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don‚Äôt know if I can post regularly&lt;/strong&gt; :  You don‚Äôt have to post every week. You don‚Äôt have to post every month. Just post when you have something to write about. Which as I‚Äôve mentioned before should be somewhat regularly as you are likely doing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; or working on &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; that you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; write about! It‚Äôs also perfectly acceptable to post something that is a work-in-progress, and add to it in increments as you work on finishing the complete piece.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-why-blog&quot;&gt;So Why Blog?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so hopefully some of your &lt;a href=&quot;#what-not-to-worry-about&quot;&gt;common fears&lt;/a&gt; have been allayed. Now let‚Äôs get into the reasons why I, and the reasons why &lt;strong&gt;YOU&lt;/strong&gt; should start a blog. I should accentuate the fact that &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; of the items listed below I actively benefit from, and you can too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It gives meaning to the time you spend on things&lt;/strong&gt; : Too often, I work on things which seemingly have a very trivial or only an incremental effect on my life or on my job. These efforts typically go unnoticed, unappreciated and/or undocumented. Instead of losing it to time, why not document what you did, how you did it, what you learned, etc‚Ä¶? In this way, it can serve as a historical record to be shared, to be remembered, to be referenced and to serve as a testament to the valuable time you spent on it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can help you remember how you did something&lt;/strong&gt; : Let your blog be a reference for yourself. In my career, and in my life, I have forgotten &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of what I have learned. If I had taken the time to document these things, in my own way, with my own context, I‚Äôd have the best possible reference to go back and remember it all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documenting can help you retain it long-term&lt;/strong&gt; : Similar to the point above, the simple act of documenting/writing things will help you retain that knowledge long-term. Worst case scenario though, if you do end up forgetting, you have it documented!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can look good on a resume or as part of a professional portfolio&lt;/strong&gt; : Having a place where you document your research and other work can impress current or future employers. This will supplement your resume by speaking to the skills and experience you claim you possess.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can help you network&lt;/strong&gt; : Ultimately, when people do read your material, they may reach out to you. In those moments, you have an opportunity to make a meaningful connection either personally or professionally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your content can help someone&lt;/strong&gt; : If you‚Äôve learned something, chances are, you aren‚Äôt the only person in the world who didn‚Äôt know that thing. Which means, someone else out there can benefit from what you learned and how you learned it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can trigger other bursts of creativity and productivity&lt;/strong&gt; : As you write and as you create, you are likely to find new ideas, based on your previous or current ideas, will materialize. Good begets great, &lt;em&gt;inspire yourself&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will likely learn more by creating&lt;/strong&gt; : Some say the best way to learn is to teach. By teaching, or in this case, by documenting what you learn or what you are working on in such a way that it is consumable by others than yourself, you will in that process learn the material in a more robust way. In other words, for you to confidently teach something, you need to know it &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well. So learn to create, create to teach and then teach to learn!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can help create a social/professional identity tied to YOU rather than where you work&lt;/strong&gt; : What I mean here is, you can market yourself through your site rather than through something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/&quot;&gt;Linkedin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or (*&lt;em&gt;grumble&lt;/em&gt;*) your resume. Linkedin is focused on your job, this makes it hard to decouple your identity from your place of work. Twitter constrains you to short bursts of thought, limiting your range and depth.  Your resume is the worst offender! It boxes you in to just a few pages where you hope to explain your professional worth. A website you own and control allows you to fully document and share who you are, what you can do, what you have done, etc‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It‚Äôs fun!&lt;/strong&gt; : I‚Äôm not saying having a blog isn‚Äôt work, &lt;a href=&quot;#with-all-that-said&quot;&gt;it is&lt;/a&gt;. But work can be fun. Especially when it‚Äôs done at your own pace and leisure. I personally get a lot of enjoyment out of maintaining my site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can turn into something more&lt;/strong&gt; : Who knows, your innocent, low-volume, professional-_ish_ blog could turn into something more. Maybe it becomes popular, maybe you can monetize it, maybe it will yield business opportunities, there is a lot of potential. This potential remains untapped unless you try.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure your identity on the web&lt;/strong&gt; : Don‚Äôt rely on traditional social media to be your identity on the web. Tie your identity to your domain. Read more about why this is important &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/08/16/your-website-your-identity&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;with-all-that-said&quot;&gt;With All That Said&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that your &lt;a href=&quot;#what-not-to-worry-about&quot;&gt;fears are quelled&lt;/a&gt; and are now excited to reap &lt;a href=&quot;#so-why-blog&quot;&gt;the rewards&lt;/a&gt; of starting a blog, let me share a few ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It does take time&lt;/strong&gt; : No surprise here, &lt;em&gt;but yes&lt;/em&gt;, writing takes time. I personally feel the time it takes to document something is worth it though, given &lt;a href=&quot;#so-why-blog&quot;&gt;all the benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may get wrapped up in it&lt;/strong&gt; : What I mean is, you may end up spending more time than you had originally thought you would. This is both good and bad! I think it is a really productive and healthy outlet, but you need to be conscious of your other time commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should put care and diligence into what you post&lt;/strong&gt; : Though I have said that your material doesn‚Äôt need to be perfect, you still need to take care to post accurate and quality material. Ultimately, this will keep your brand in a healthy state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap-Up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that‚Äôs my pitch. Tons of people do it. You can do it. Your perspective is valuable. The benefits are immense. &lt;strong&gt;You should start a blog&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So are you convinced? I‚Äôd love to hear about it! &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/contact&quot;&gt;Let me know&lt;/a&gt; your blog idea or share your URL with me. If its an infosec-related blog, I‚Äôll even add it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/infosec-blogs#boutique-security-blogs&quot;&gt;my collection&lt;/a&gt;! Still not convinced? I‚Äôd like to hear about that too. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Email is ubiquitous. Email is a &lt;em&gt;deluge&lt;/em&gt;. Email is a &lt;strong&gt;mess&lt;/strong&gt;. But there is a way‚Ä¶ a way to quell the torrent of spam, subscriptions, notifications, alerts, reminders, social media updates, promotions, confirmations and whatever else seeks to wreak havoc on your inbox - &lt;strong&gt;Inbox Zero&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UjeTMb3Yk&quot;&gt;first introduced by Merlin Mann during a Google TechTalk&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. I‚Äôve never &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; watched this video nor do I remember when I was first introduced to the idea of ‚ÄúInbox Zero‚Äù but I‚Äôve been very successful in remaining true to &lt;em&gt;my idea of this concept&lt;/em&gt; for well over a decade and I‚Äôm here to say it has brought sanity and control to my digital life and it can for you too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mail.google.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;ph ph-envelope-simple lg&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you see below is madness‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/toomanyemails.png&quot; alt=&quot;toomanyemails&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7AinOjDiNQ&quot;&gt;‚Ä¶Madness? This. is. EMAIL!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lets-zero-it-out&quot;&gt;Let‚Äôs Zero It Out&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite it‚Äôs name, &lt;em&gt;Inbox Zero&lt;/em&gt; is not about having &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; in your inbox. Rather, it is about having a &lt;strong&gt;repeatable&lt;/strong&gt; process by which you can deal with each email you receive, which in turn gives you control over your inbox and reduces what remains to only the items that are either pending and/or actionable. Let‚Äôs walk through this process‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsubscribe&lt;/strong&gt;: I recommend a scorched-earth approach to unsubscribing to subscription-based emails. Unless you absolutely need something, click that ‚Äúunsubscribe‚Äù button and be rid of it. &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: If an email doesn‚Äôt have an ‚ÄúUnsubscribe‚Äù link, mark it as spam or even create a mail rule to auto-send it where it belongs - anywhere but your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consume&lt;/strong&gt;: A lot of email is simply informational. Anything in your inbox that matches this criteria can easily be archived (Step 5) or deleted (Step 6) once you have consumed the necessary information. If you find the information not-useful, perhaps consider Step 1.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take Action&lt;/strong&gt;: Does the email represent something that needs to be done? If so, do what needs to be done and then archive (Step 5) or delete (Step 6) the respective email. If it can‚Äôt be done right now due to a dependency, see Step 4. &lt;strong&gt;*If it CAN be done but you don‚Äôt have time for it, simply leave it in your inbox until you can get to it&lt;/strong&gt;. In this way, these emails will serve as constant reminders of things that need to and can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save For Later&lt;/strong&gt;: If an email represents something that needs to be done but can‚Äôt be done due to a dependency, move it to a separate folder (or label if your a Gmail person). I have a folder literally called ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù that these &lt;em&gt;to-do&lt;/em&gt; emails go to. All of these to-do emails should go to the same special ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder. &lt;strong&gt;*It is important to revisit this folder on a frequent basis to see if there is anything that no longer has dependencies and is thus actionable&lt;/strong&gt;. Here, you can do what needs to be done and then proceed to archive (Step 5) or delete (Step 6) the email.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Archive&lt;/strong&gt;: When you are through with an email but would like to keep it for later-reference, archive it or move it to a folder of your choosing. This will effectively remove it from your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trash&lt;/strong&gt;: For everything else, &lt;em&gt;trash it&lt;/em&gt;. You don‚Äôt need it. Get it out of your inbox. &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Be mindful of what you are trashing. Chances are, if you are trashing an email, it should have never been in your inbox to begin with. I recommend unsubscribing from as many of these would-be-trashed emails as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always fancied myself a &lt;strong&gt;minimalist&lt;/strong&gt;. This mindset helps me make ‚Äútough‚Äù decisions when it comes to unsubscribing, trashing or otherwise being ‚Äúreal‚Äù with myself about what I need or don‚Äôt need in my life. I‚Äôm also a particularly &lt;strong&gt;organized&lt;/strong&gt; individual, especially with respect to my &lt;em&gt;digital&lt;/em&gt; life. &lt;em&gt;Inbox Zero&lt;/em&gt; is a manifestation of these two virtues and is a philosophy that with some practice, can be exercised by anyone. With it, you too can reclaim your inbox, get things done and achieve digital zen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Herman Miller Logitech Embody Review</title>
        <shark:summary><p>Like many of us these days (in the pandemic-age), I spend a large portion of any given week <em>sitting</em> in my home-office at my desk.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Like many of us these days (in the pandemic-age), I spend a large portion of any given week &lt;em&gt;sitting&lt;/em&gt; in my home-office at my desk. For too long I had resigned myself to sitting in a chair that featured no customization, no back support and no particular ergonomic advantages. Given the time I spend in a chair, I decided I need an upgrade and resolved to find an amazing chair, no matter the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;containbox&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;TL;DR&lt;/b&gt;: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hermanmiller.com/gaming/herman-miller-x-logitech-g-embody-gaming-chair/2517590.html?lang=en_US&quot;&gt;Logitech G Embody&lt;/a&gt; has a critical design flaw which results in the chair being very uncomfortable to sit in. This flaw makes this chair a no-go at any price, much less $1500.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my search for the best possible chair, I consistently came across positive reviews for chairs from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hermanmiller.com&quot;&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/&quot;&gt;Aeron&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/embody-chairs/&quot;&gt;Embody&lt;/a&gt; were two models that I saw mentioned again and again. After seeing pictures of the Embody, I fell in love with the design (specifically the cool-looking back of the chair). It was then of course that I then discovered the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hermanmiller.com/gaming/herman-miller-x-logitech-g-embody-gaming-chair/2517590.html?lang=en_US&quot;&gt;Logitech variant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the traditional Embody chair. Right off the bat though, the problem with this chair is the price. $1500‚Ä¶ For a chair‚Ä¶ But! My mission was to find the best chair for me, and I wasn‚Äôt going to let the cost be too much of an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Logitech version of the chair features the same design and features of the regular version but now sports an ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;enhanced gaming seat&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù (ironic as I‚Äôll soon find out), which is basically an added layer of cushion on the bottom as well as a copper-infused ‚Äúcooling‚Äù foam embedded within that seat cushion. Couple these added comfort features with (awesome) blue color accents unique to the Logitech version of this chair and I was sold. Yes, this chair costs $1500. But surely this is a worthy investment if it makes sitting for extended periods of time both enjoyable, comfortable and better-for-me right?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/hermanmiller/Screen+Shot+2021-02-12+at+8.53.27+PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of Chair&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-review&quot;&gt;The Review&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chair arrives in a massive box, completely assembled. You need only open the box and roll it on out - sweet! That said, the chair has a certain heft to it and carrying up a few flights of stairs to my office took a bit of effort. Once I did get it in front of my desk though, I took a step back to admire it. If nothing else, it certainly looked cool! (Please ignore my poor cable-management.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/hermanmiller/IMG_1426.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Desk Shot w/ chair&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the chair in place, I sat down and ran through Herman Miller‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hermanmiller.com/content/dam/hermanmiller/documents/user_information/herman_miller_x_logitech_g_embody_gaming_chair_adjustment_guide.pdf&quot;&gt;adjustment guide&lt;/a&gt; to get it tweaked to my liking. With the first (fully adjusted) sit, my initial opinion was‚Ä¶ ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;the chair seems comfortable, maybe not $1500 comfortable, but comfortable all the same&lt;/em&gt;.‚Äù But as I would find out, first impressions only go so far‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get to what I didn‚Äôt like about this chair, let me gush about what it gets right. The seat-back is in my mind the best part of this chair. Moving beyond it‚Äôs unique and interesting design, the PostureFit / BackFit spinal support tech built into the back of this chair feels really good. It not only supports your back in a way that is very comforting but it flexes and moves as you do which helps maintain this support as you change posture or wiggle about in the chair. &lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt;(t)!, (pun intended) the seat itself, the bottom of this chair, is where things begin to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Logitech variant of the Embody chair features an ‚Äúenhanced gaming seat‚Äù, the main feature of which is an added 1/2-inch layer of copper-infused cooling foam. What‚Äôs not to like about a little extra cooling-cush for your tush right? Among the many adjustment options this chair supports, there is the ability to extend the &lt;em&gt;seat depth&lt;/em&gt;. The problem here is when you extend the seat (which those who are a little taller would likely want to do), the added foam is not extended as well. The result is a very pronounced &lt;strong&gt;end&lt;/strong&gt; to the foam which may not seem like much when you first sit down but as time passes, I began to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; the divide between the normal cushioned part of the chair and the extended, non-cushioned part of the chair. After sitting in the chair a while, I began to feel what seemed like a bar, jutting into my legs and running across the underside of my thighs. It was only after disconnecting the seat flap and inspecting the underside of the seat that I realized it was this exact boundary line where I was feeling the protrusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/hermanmiller/IMG_1428.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Seat Flap Foam&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony here of course is that the &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; (functional) added feature made to the Logitech version of this chair, the ‚Äúenhanced gaming seat‚Äù is also the feature which dooms it (in my opinion). Though I haven‚Äôt tried the Embody classic, I would suspect it doesn‚Äôt suffer this or any similar design flaw. Only after I made this unfortunate discovery did I find reviews of the chair on Herman Miller‚Äôs website lamenting the same problem‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/hermanmiller/Screen+Shot+2021-02-07+at+1.50.49+AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Review 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/hermanmiller/Screen+Shot+2021-02-07+at+1.52.56+AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Review 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backing up for a second. After I determined the chair was uncomfortable due to the ‚Äúprotruding bar-like sensation‚Äù but before I realized why exactly I was feeling that, I contacted Herman Miller support, explaining the discomfort. This is the response I received‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Sorry for the delay. You‚Äôre feeling the extra cushion. There is no defect in the chair. That‚Äôs just the way the fabric and extra cushion were designed.&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well alright then, it‚Äôs definitely a feature not a bug!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Awesome design. Will definitely look cool in your work-space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ergonomics of the seat-back were really fantastic. Lower-back support and it‚Äôs adherence to my spine seemed uniquely impressive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The chair is very adjustable. (Arm height and width, back fit, seat depth, seat height, etc‚Ä¶)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smaller profile seat-back made swiveling my legs out from under my desk easier as I did not have to push the chair out from under the desk in order to get out of the chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foam padding does not extend all the way to the front of the chair. This makes sitting in the chair very uncomfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seat bottom is generally uncomfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arm rests are clunky, a little wonky to adjust and are too easily pushed out or in with accidental pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The chair is very creaky/noisy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;an-attempt-to-fix-the-chair&quot;&gt;An Attempt to Fix the Chair&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent $1500 on this piece and despite Herman Miller‚Äôs lack-of-support from their support staff, I still liked enough about it that I felt compelled to try and fix the fundamental flaw plaguing this chair if could. From my previous dissection, I knew I had access to the underside of the seat flap where the built-in padding was. My proposed solution was to buy a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08D8Z1BJR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;1/2 inch-thich foam yoga mat&lt;/a&gt; and cut a piece of it to fit the portion of the extended seat that was foam-less. You can look in wonder upon this brilliance below‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/hermanmiller/IMG_1427.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Extra foam&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even with this addition, after some time I still felt that same uncomfortable divide. Perhaps the newly introduced foam wasn‚Äôt quite the same thickness? Or maybe the yoga mat depressed a different amount than the built-in foam? In any case, the chair was still equally uncomfortable. In the end, I take solace in knowing I tried to make it work, but in the end, the &lt;em&gt;enhanced seat cushion&lt;/em&gt; did not only fail to enhance the chair, it was in fact the dealbreaker. Luckily enough, Herman Miller has a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hermanmiller.com/returns.html?lang=en_US&quot;&gt;return policy&lt;/a&gt;. Just remember to keep the box and packaging materials it came with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-on&quot;&gt;Moving On&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my quest continues. After resolving to return the Embody, I did more chair research and stumbled across the oft-reviewed chairs from &lt;a href=&quot;https://secretlab.co&quot;&gt;SecretLab&lt;/a&gt;. Perusing the site, I decided on trying out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://secretlab.co/collections/titan-series#titan_2020_softweave-charcoal_blue&quot;&gt;Secretlab TITAN&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôm actually sitting in this chair as I finish typing out the Embody review! I‚Äôll post an update if this chair ends up being the one for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#jhu-masters-in-cybersecurity-review&quot;&gt;Johns Hopkins Cybersecurity Masters Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity (a.k.a. Information Security or ‚Äúinfosec‚Äù) is an extremely fast-moving, technical field and one that for many, demands near-constant learning. This makes working in the Cybersecurity field both exciting and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-awareness/dont-let-analysts-burnout/&quot;&gt;exhausting&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Information_Security_Analyst/Salary&quot;&gt;Well above average salaries&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/90182-the-cybersecurity-talent-gap-an-industry-crisis&quot;&gt;over-abundance of available jobs&lt;/a&gt; are just &lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/10-reasons-why-you-should-pursue-a-career-in-information-security/&quot;&gt;two of the compelling reasons&lt;/a&gt; to consider becoming an information security professional. Given the business-critical nature of a security professionals job, these individuals are expected to be highly trained, which (in my experience) typically means certifications, formal training courses and higher education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infosec is in a bit of a golden age with respect to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/online-training#title&quot;&gt;incredible amount of trainings&lt;/a&gt;, educational programs and online resources which are available, both free and paid, many of which also come with a certification you can sit for. These resources cover a vast array of information security disciplines (e.g. network security, penetration testing, incident response, compliance, etc‚Ä¶), so it can often be overwhelming for both newcomers and veterans to determine where to focus their time, effort and money with respect to getting the best education. To illustrate this point, hop into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/&quot;&gt;r/netsecstudents&lt;/a&gt; and it won‚Äôt take you long to find post after post asking the same general question - ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;What certificate/training should I take.&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù It‚Äôs a valid question and one that I‚Äôve asked myself numerous times over the years. Whether we‚Äôre trying to improve our resume or gain some new technical capabilities, this question often remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past five years I‚Äôve been fortunate to have been provided a &lt;em&gt;near&lt;/em&gt;-unlimited training budget and have been even more fortunate to have been given the &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; (both by my company and my family) to pursue these academic and learning interests. In this time I was able to achieve/complete a &lt;a href=&quot;#certification-and-training-mini-reviews&quot;&gt;plethora of certifications and training&lt;/a&gt; classes as well as start and finish a &lt;a href=&quot;#jhu-masters-in-cybersecurity-review&quot;&gt;Masters degree&lt;/a&gt;. Having recently completed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/programs/cybersecurity/masters-degree-requirements/&quot;&gt;degree program&lt;/a&gt; as well as having achieved the relatively challenging &lt;a href=&quot;#sec660-advanced-penetration-testing-exploit-writing-and-ethical-hacking-gxpn-sans&quot;&gt;GIAC GXPN&lt;/a&gt; certification, I wanted to take a look back at the last couple years and answer a few questions‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;Would I do anything differently&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;em&gt;What have I learned&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Will these achievements actually benefit me professionally&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;em&gt;What certifications we‚Äôre useful&lt;/em&gt;? I hope that my somewhat unique perspective can help provide guidance to those asking the question, &lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúWhat certificate/training should I take?‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-education-journey&quot;&gt;My Education Journey&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally set out to become a developer, attending a four-year university as a computer science major. By the end of my &lt;em&gt;5 year&lt;/em&gt; college run I had switched majors three times, transferred schools and come away not with a CS degree, but with a degree in &lt;strong&gt;information security&lt;/strong&gt;. Degree in hand, I began my search for an entry-level security position but soon found out that the degree alone was not a compelling enough argument. Companies were looking for individuals with &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;, even for entry-level positions - something I just didn‚Äôt have. For me, certifications provided a means in which to qualify for positions in the absence of having this experience. Back then, and continuing to this day, a certification (more so than even my 4 year degree!) was enough to put a candidate (like myself) over that lack-of-experience obstacle and in front of some hiring managers. In those early days, I self-paid-for and acquired both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security&quot;&gt;Security+&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/&quot;&gt;CEH&lt;/a&gt; certifications, both of which directly helped land me positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studying for certifications and attending training requires motivation and an aptitude for the technical intricacies of the field - neither of these are out of reach for most. I certainly had a hunger to learn and the educational background/aptitude to succeed. Given the immediate success of landing positions shortly after having achieved previous certifications, my aim was to seek out other certification opportunities. Unfortunately, certification exams and training courses also (generally) require a good bit of cash. This put many certifications either completely out of reach for me or far enough away that I wasn‚Äôt sure the ROI was truly there for me to drop my own money on them. During this time, I bounced around several contract gigs, picking up an assortment of experience, always hoping to land at a company that might be willing to invest in me by way of paying for some trainings/certs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few years I landed at what is my current place of employment and I finally got my wish - a company able and willing to invest in me. So I took full advantage of it. &lt;a href=&quot;#certification-and-training-mini-reviews&quot;&gt;16+ certifications and countless trainings&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶ when I wasn‚Äôt busy with my day job, I was busy with training. Many days, my day job &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; training. I went from one training to the next, one cert to the next, at such a quick pace, I hardly even had time to actually come back, settle in and practice what I had learned. In hindsight, it‚Äôs easy to see that I became somewhat addicted to the process. Earlier struggles both finding work in the field and funding a cyber security education gave rise to an insatiable need to learn as much as possible and in parallel, get as many certifications and take as many trainings as possible. Now after these past 5 years, I have plenty of letters, plenty of new skills and some wisdom to share‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quick-qa&quot;&gt;Quick Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would I have done anything differently?&lt;/strong&gt; If I could do it all over again, I would take much more time after each training/certification to really apply newly acquired skills, seeking to truly and permanently absorb what I had learned. I also would have spent more time trying to figure out specifically what area of security I wanted to specialize in, which would have allowed me to carefully craft a tailored training regimen better suited to helping me achieve a more targeted expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what have I learned?&lt;/strong&gt; It‚Äôs a strange dichotomy, through the course of taking rapid-fire, high-intensity trainings, I was able to learn A LOT of different things very quickly. A side-effect of this however was me forgetting much more than I wanted of what I had learned! Had I been more committed to letting this information soak in through practice and individual research, I may have developed a more robust expertise across these subjects. With this said, I did learn (and absorb) quite a bit. My main areas of focus were penetration testing, vulnerability research, reverse engineering and what I‚Äôll call ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;general security&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù. To me, general security is a combination of a number of foundational security-relevant disciplines including networking (TCP/IP), web applications, operating systems, etc‚Ä¶ Between all of the different trainings and courses, I found there was considerable content overlap. I think where I am strongest technically is in these areas of significant overlap. Learning the same thing multiple times (unsurprisingly!) has the effect of really drilling it into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will these achievements actually benefit me professionally?&lt;/strong&gt; This I can‚Äôt answer‚Ä¶ &lt;strong&gt;yet&lt;/strong&gt;. Since I haven‚Äôt looked for a new job in the last five years, I haven‚Äôt seen what, if anything, my bundle of certs plus Masters degree would be able to do for me out in the job market. More specifically, I‚Äôm unsure if these accolades would be beneficial in helping me get to &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; next step, whatever that might be. What I can say is that with each new certification, there is a potential new door that could open (for jobs looking for that specific certification). Though there is certainly diminishing returns with each new cert on a single resume, I have found that recruiters and hiring managers are typically impressed when you have a multitude of them to showcase. I have definitely received many emails from recruiters saying they are very impressed with my certifications and overall experience. So time will tell if they will actually make a difference in any future job searches! At least I can take comfort in knowing my resume will match plenty of certification-related, resume-sourcing keyword searches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What certifications have proved useful?&lt;/strong&gt; I‚Äôll answer this in more detail in the &lt;a href=&quot;#certification-and-training-mini-reviews&quot;&gt;Certification and Training Mini-Reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What certification/training should I take?&lt;/strong&gt; I‚Äôll get into this in more detail in the section &lt;a href=&quot;#what-certification-or-training-should-i-take&quot;&gt;What certification/training should I take?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advicestream&quot;&gt;Advicestream&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my non-contiguous, random collection of certification/training-related advice/musings‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Studying for / taking certification exams and taking training courses requires &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;effort/motivation&lt;/strong&gt;. Keep this in mind when approaching any potential cert/training. Make sure you have all three in place before committing to any course/certification.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs hard to put a price tag on that first cert. For those who are having trouble breaking into the field, a certification may be what tips the scale in your favor. In this case, even an expensive cert (for example, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/&quot;&gt;SANS&lt;/a&gt; certification) could in-fact pay off quickly if it helps you land that relatively high-paying junior &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/salary/information-security-engineer-salaries-in-united-states&quot;&gt;infosec engineer role&lt;/a&gt;. Given the high demand for qualified individuals, even entry-level positions can command &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indeed.com/salaries/junior-cyber-security-analyst-Salaries&quot;&gt;impressive salaries&lt;/a&gt;. With respect to certifications specifically, my recommendation for those looking for that breakout role is to research positions that are of interest to you, see what certifications they are expecting (or mandating) that you have, and then figure out how to get it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on the &lt;em&gt;journey&lt;/em&gt;. A certification is nothing more than a piece of paper or a couple of letters behind your name. What matters most is the skills and knowledge you gain while prepping/training for that cert. Take your time to truly understand the material, acquire a solid foundation of knowledge, one that you can build on top of as you become more advanced. Focusing on simply passing a test rather than just understanding the material will hurt you in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‚Ä¶on the thread of ‚Äúunderstanding the material‚Äù, I have a note for those fortunate enough to take a SANS exam (or similarly ‚Äúopen book‚Äù exam): A common recommendation for SANS exams (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/security-awareness-training/blog/3-tips-successfully-prepare-ssap-exam&quot;&gt;even from SANS themselves&lt;/a&gt;) is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://tisiphone.net/2015/08/18/giac-testing/&quot;&gt;create an index&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;I don‚Äôt recommend this&lt;/strong&gt;. Now i understand people have different test-taking strategies and some people are just innately better at ‚Äútaking tests‚Äù than others, but I think indexing encourages not really understanding the material, but rather, promotes just searching for the answer come test time. Yes, this may make getting the cert easier, and if that is your goal then so be it! But I urge those who are also interested in retaining the material to not create an index, and in that way, when studying, they aim for a better, more robust understanding. With this said, my personal strategy (I‚Äôve never created an ‚Äúindex‚Äù), is to use the little sticky post-its that SANS provides to mark the different chapters/sections of the book (as well as any other potentially information-dense areas of the books). In this way, you can still quickly flip to a section of the course material during the test (or when studying!) to help with recalling certain information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs worth reiterating here, albeit in a different way, &lt;strong&gt;take your time&lt;/strong&gt;. Focus on the material, attempt to gain true comprehension and don‚Äôt seek to just memorize certain data points needed to pass the test. Pay very close attention to the &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt; stuff. Infosec is a broad field with many disciplines but the core concepts of security, networking, computing, etc‚Ä¶. are shared amongst all of these. This means having a very thorough understanding of the basics will help you excel in all areas of security, from compliance to penetration testing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Government contract roles (which may be more numerous in certain locales) often look for &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.cyber.mil/cw/cwmp/dod-approved-8570-baseline-certifications/&quot;&gt;specific certifications&lt;/a&gt;. Obtaining one of these certs is an easy way to immediately qualify for these positions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don‚Äôt depend too much on certifications. Yes, a certification &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be able to help you qualify for a job or get your foot in the door for an interview but often it only goes that far. Your peers will likely not think more of you, your boss will likely not promote you, the work itself will not become easier all by merely getting a certification. Focus on what you can &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt;, the cert is just a bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experience has been and will remain king with respect to ‚Äúproving‚Äù your abilities to a prospective employer. Certifications however, can certainly help a candidate get a foot in the door for an interview or even uniquely qualify them for a role that may explicitly require a specific certification.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Certs, trainings, degrees‚Ä¶ ultimately, they serve one of two distinct purposes (in my opinion). Bolstering a resume and acquiring knowledge/increasing skills. Remember this when thinking about what you want to pursue next!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find a way to expand on what you learned during the course of studying for a certification or attending a training by doing your own independent research. At the point where you feel you really understand the material, you can then run off and sign up for the next thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-certification-or-training-should-i-take&quot;&gt;What Certification or Training Should I Take?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so let‚Äôs try to answer this primary question. Let‚Äôs approach the answer based on where someone might be in their career or job search. Choose the scenario below which best describes your current standing‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You‚Äôre new to Information Security and are looking to get a job&lt;/strong&gt;: Do some research on what certifications (if any) the jobs you‚Äôd be interested in are asking for. (Try popular job search websites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.monster.com/&quot;&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/&quot;&gt;Linkedin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indeed.com/hire/sem-haj-dual&quot;&gt;Indeed&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few). Where you find some certification requirement commonality amongst these job reqs, take a look at how you can get that specific cert. If the training, or exam voucher is expensive, take a look at what salary you may expect provided you get the job and calculate your return on investment. You may find that investing in yourself by paying for the cert can pay off in a big way. This methodology is more relevant for junior positions as the certification can stand in place of the lack of professional experience as it &lt;a href=&quot;#my-education-journey&quot;&gt;did for me&lt;/a&gt; in my early professional career.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are currently in a junior role and are looking to advance&lt;/strong&gt;: I‚Äôd recommend a similar approach as above, with the tweak that you will likely be targeting a more advanced certification. Keep in mind though that at this point, unless the job you are looking at is contractually-obligated to supply personnel with certain certifications, it is less likely that a certificate is really what you need to &lt;em&gt;get into&lt;/em&gt; your next role. Rather, focus more on the experience that is being asked for on the job req you are interested in. If getting a certification can help you obtain that specific experience, then great! Two birds with one stone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are a mid-level or senior security professional and are looking to add valuable skills to your resume&lt;/strong&gt;:  Focus on practical certifications and training that can get you to ‚Äúexpert‚Äù level within a specific knowledge area you may already have some expertise in or that can fill an important gap in your overall knowledge. Keep in mind, there‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/online-training#title&quot;&gt;plenty of free and paid training&lt;/a&gt; out there to help you get there, so don‚Äôt immediately default to trying to pay for some expensive certification or training. Do some research and then get learning! Some ‚Äúdomains‚Äù to keep in mind would be web applications, programming/development, cloud, networking, and incident response. I think focusing more on &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; you need rather than some certification is more appropriate in this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You‚Äôre interested in getting into penetration testing&lt;/strong&gt;: Information security as a profession is made up of a lot of unique sub-disciplines. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/penetration-testing/&quot;&gt;Penetration testing&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. ‚ÄúPentesting‚Äù) happens to be one of the more popular aspirations for those entering the field, even though penetration testers as a whole make up only a small fraction of the infosec community. For those interested in infosec, don‚Äôt immediately think that pentesting is what is right for you or that it‚Äôs the only interesting option. Take your time to research everything else you can do in infosec before committing to the pentest path. However, for those that are truly interested, I highly recommend taking a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/&quot;&gt;PWK/OSCP&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/&quot;&gt;Offensive Security&lt;/a&gt; and/or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elearnsecurity.com/course/penetration_testing/&quot;&gt;PTP&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elearnsecurity.com/&quot;&gt;eLearnSecurity&lt;/a&gt;. Both are practical, lab-based, hands-on certifications with a LOT of good training material. Once completing either of those, I‚Äôd recommend checking out the other, more advanced trainings/certs offered by both Offensive Security and eLearnSecurity. For more info, please check out my reviews for both the &lt;a href=&quot;#offensive-security-certified-professional-oscp&quot;&gt;PWK/OSCP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#penetration-testing-professional-ecppt-elearnsecurity&quot;&gt;PTP&lt;/a&gt; courses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You aren‚Äôt sure what security discipline are you interested in yet&lt;/strong&gt;: I‚Äôd reference my initial advice here. If you want a job in infosec go take a look at what certs are being asked for within the job reqs you are interested in. Otherwise, I probably wouldn‚Äôt throw money at a random cert (yet!). I also have a guide for those interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/getting-into-information-security#title&quot;&gt;getting into the field&lt;/a&gt;! If you aren‚Äôt sure exactly where you want to go, then don‚Äôt sweat it! Get a job anywhere in the infosec field (where you can), and try it out. Maybe you get a SIOC position or a compliance position and do that for a few months. If it‚Äôs interesting, pursue it further, if not, pivot somewhere else in the field. A lot of what you‚Äôll learn in one infosec sub-discipline transfers very nicely to any other role in infosec. Finally, feel free to check out my &lt;a href=&quot;#certification-and-training-mini-reviews&quot;&gt;series of mini-reviews&lt;/a&gt; covering a large assortment of popular certification/trainings I have personally taken.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;None of these apply and you‚Äôre just interested in taking something new&lt;/strong&gt;: If none of the scenarios really apply to you then maybe peruse my &lt;a href=&quot;#certification-and-training-mini-reviews&quot;&gt;series of certification/training mini-reviews&lt;/a&gt;, take a look at the vast collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/online-training#title&quot;&gt;online education resources&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/contact&quot;&gt;reach out to me&lt;/a&gt; for more personalized recommendations!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;thoughts-on-sans-training-and-giac-certification-exams&quot;&gt;Thoughts on SANS Training and GIAC Certification Exams&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the overwhelming popularity and industry mind-share that this organization, as a security training provider has, coupled with the breadth/depth of experience I have taking their classes and acquiring their certifications, I wanted to take some time to share my perspective on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/&quot;&gt;SANS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll start by saying I have &lt;em&gt;mixed feelings&lt;/em&gt; overall on SANS. I think their course material is top-notch, their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/profiles/instructors/&quot;&gt;instructors&lt;/a&gt; are world-class, industry-leaders and their network and reach (in terms of how well-known they are) is basically unrivaled. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt;‚Ä¶ they are simply too expensive of an option for most individuals paying out-of-pocket. Secondly, I believe that a sizable majority of the material provided in any given SANS training course is accessible (in some way) online, for free. You need only an Internet connection and the desire to do some research yourself to find it. If not immediately available online you can often find the material in a book or blog post or even a github repo likely also written by the author themselves! So what you are paying for isn‚Äôt necessarily the material (which again, is likely available open-source), rather you pay for by signing up for a SANS course is the convenience and the delivery format. From how I see things, the &lt;em&gt;ingredients&lt;/em&gt; are all readily available. I compare SANS to going to a fancy restaurant and having a world-class chef prepare a meal for you - one you could have made with those same ingredients at home. With some practice, and most if not all of the same ingredients at your disposal, you too can feed your mind the same dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get into exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I would recommend you go about giving yourself a SANS education without ever attending a SANS course, let me qualify what I said above with two important points‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;, if you get the chance to attend a SANS course, paid-for by your employer, absolutely take them up on this offer. Though I do think in many cases you can replicate SANS course content with free or cheap resources online, actually attending a SANS course is an amazing opportunity and can provide the following‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn the material in a quicker, more direct fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get immediate help on advanced topics from an industry expert. This can help you get over learning roadblocks faster than you may have otherwise been able to on your own.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Network with like-minded individuals in your field as well as expert instructors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Obtain a certification that is highly regarded in the field and could help you with future job searches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt;, though it is becoming harder to recommend due to increasing cost (now $2500, where as only a year or two ago it was closer to $1000), participating in a SANS &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/work-study/&quot;&gt;work study&lt;/a&gt; can give someone an avenue to attending a SANS training for much cheaper than the normal price (which is over $7000 and can even exceed $8000 after bundling the certification, on-demand materials, etc‚Ä¶). I‚Äôve facilitated on 4 separate occasions and can tell you that overall, it‚Äôs a pretty easy gig! You‚Äôre asked to assist with conference setup/teardown as well as some light operational tasking throughout each day (mainly fetching stuff for the instructor if needed and collecting the notorious daily SANS surveys). I think even at the new price, it is still (albeit barely) a decent value, especially for those who are maybe looking for that first cert. As a ‚Äúfirst cert‚Äù possibility, I think SANS is one of the best options for a candidate to make themselves stand out with respect to getting an entry-level position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so let‚Äôs say your employer won‚Äôt shell out the cash for a SANS training and you can‚Äôt either (nor have you had success getting into the work study). How can you give yourself a SANS-equivalent education yourself? Here‚Äôs what I would do‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, figure out what you‚Äôre interested in via their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-skills-roadmap?msc=course-list-lp&quot;&gt;Cyber Security Skills Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. Figure out where you are technically or where you‚Äôd like to be and pick out the certification that is next in your &lt;em&gt;path&lt;/em&gt;. Next, find the ‚ÄúCourse Syllabus‚Äù for the chosen course, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/network-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking/&quot;&gt;SEC560: Network Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking&lt;/a&gt;. On this page, you can scroll down to the ‚ÄúSyllabus‚Äù section and see a relatively in-depth description of the topics covered during each day of the training for that course. Using this syllabus, you can build your own self-paced, self-taught curriculum, for free (or at-least on the cheap), online! Just google each topic and hunt for trainings/free content online related to that topic. I promise there is much more than you might think and you can find quite a bit of success with this method. This will require some determination, and is certainly more of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/say-try-harder/&quot;&gt;‚ÄúTry Harder‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; (more on this in a bit) approach, but where money is short, I believe you can make up for it in this way. If you‚Äôre having trouble finding resources online, check out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/online-training#title&quot;&gt;list of education resources&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;certification-and-training-mini-reviews&quot;&gt;Certification and Training Mini-Reviews&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having taken and completed each of the trainings/certifications below, I wanted to provide a quick ‚Äúreview‚Äù of what I thought of each course. The reviews aren‚Äôt meant to summarize what is covered in these courses but rather give my thoughts on the value of each as well as recommendations or advice for those potentially interested in taking them. These are point-in-time assessments and as such can not reflect any updates to the material since the time I took it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: February 2016, TCSE Obtained: February 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt believe this training/certification is still available. Instead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tenable.com/&quot;&gt;Tenable&lt;/a&gt; has established the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tenable.com/education/on-demand-courses&quot;&gt;Tenable University&lt;/a&gt; which is home to a number of online courses covering an assortment of topics related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tenable.com/vulnerability-management&quot;&gt;Vulnerability Management&lt;/a&gt; as well as courses covering the use/engineering of their suite of tools (namely, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-professional&quot;&gt;Nessus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tenable.com/products/tenable-io&quot;&gt;Tenable.io&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tenable.com/products/tenable-sc&quot;&gt;Tenable.sc&lt;/a&gt;). What‚Äôs more, they even offer certifications you can quickly pick up and put on your resume, all for free! For anyone looking to break into the infosec field or get more into vulnerability management, penetration testing, or offensive security in general, I &lt;strong&gt;highly recommend getting into this alternate material&lt;/strong&gt;. I personally got my start in the &lt;em&gt;technical&lt;/em&gt; information security space via Vulnerability Management and attribute my success in large part to what I learned specializing in this area. Every organization is (or should be) doing some form ofVulnerability Management or network vulnerability scanning which means no matter where you go with these skills you will have relevant, applicable experience. I also believe that having a robust understanding of &lt;em&gt;vulnerabilities&lt;/em&gt; is useful in just about any infosec sub-discipline. Compliance pros need to understand risk, and vulnerabilities represent a large swath of an organizations technical risk-surface. Penetration testers obviously need to understand vulnerabilities as they are typically taking advantage of them as part of their daily job! ‚ÄúBlue-teamers‚Äù (e.g. incident responders, forensics, threat hunters, network analysts, etc‚Ä¶) need to understand vulnerabilities since these are generally the soft spots in a network or on a system that the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù are targeting. Understanding how vulnerabilities manifest themselves, the consequence(s) of exploitation and how to mitigate them is critical for defensive security professionals as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a brief period of time I got to play around with the powerful (and expensive) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coresecurity.com/products/core-impact&quot;&gt;Core Impact&lt;/a&gt; exploitation framework. During this time, I traveled to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coresecurity.com/&quot;&gt;Core Security&lt;/a&gt; HQ to take the Core Impact training course, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://training.coresecurity.com/courses/course-v1:CoreSecurity+CI200x+19_1v1/about&quot;&gt;CICP&lt;/a&gt;. Core Impact is a mature, and relatively intuitive tool. This makes user-training (in my opinion) mostly unnecessary. To be clear, this training is centered around &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the tool, as opposed to actual technical network penetration or exploitation methodology. Save the trip, save the money, this training is &lt;strong&gt;not something I would recommend&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The course has evolved quite a bit since I took it in 2016 so I won‚Äôt speak in-depth to what is covered. For that sort of thing, just search online to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=sans+sec560+review&quot;&gt;find more in-depth reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the course material. With this said, taking a look at the most up-to-date syllabus you‚Äôll find that this course is chock-full of valuable penetration testing knowledge covering a wide-array of critical pentesting concepts including network reconnaissance, writing reports, scoping engagements, Nmap, Nessus, PowerShell, Metasploit, Veil, Pivoting, Empire, John, Mimikatz, Hydra, Kerberos, Responder, Bloodhound, ZAP, SQLi and more! Despite the material being quite sound in its overall coverage and depth, I believe the format is not ideal for actually learning penetration testing. I say this because penetration testing, especially as someone new to it, is likely dominated by a lot of trial and error. What this means is that you need a lot of time to try something, see if it works, learn why it didn‚Äôt and then try again. In other words, having time to fail and in some cases fail a lot, is very valuable. The pace in which SANS courses are conducted is not conducive to this method of learning. The format for labs is a series of individual exercises whereby the student has (in my opinion) their hand held throughout, each step is explained to them in precise detail, the answer is provided in short-order and you are then quickly whisked away to the next part of the lecture. SANS does give you the option during these labs to ‚Äúnot skip ahead‚Äù and see the answer(s) but in reality you likely won‚Äôt have time to take this figure-it-out-yourself approach. Being spoon-fed information in this manner is an &lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt; way to be introduced to a technique or tool but I feel that later, when you attempt to exercise this knowledge in a practical setting you will likely feel unprepared having not actually practiced what you had learned in any meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the certification, I think it has some benefit on a resume as I have seen plenty of job reqs asking for it. BUT! If you are taking this course you are probably interested in getting a job as an actual penetration tester and as such, I would argue that a lot of companies actually hiring penetration testers are looking for proof the candidate actually has some real, practical, more-robust, hands-on experience which you really just can‚Äôt get with this training in it‚Äôs current form. For these reasons, I &lt;strong&gt;wouldn‚Äôt recommend&lt;/strong&gt; this course. With this said, SANS &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; slowly moving their certification exams to a &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/blog/hands-on-real-world-testing&quot;&gt;practical format&lt;/a&gt;. I think this will help with the way those in the field perceive these certifications, especially compared to their more ‚Äúpractical‚Äù brethren such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/&quot;&gt;OSCP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;certified-information-system-security-professional-cissp-isc2&quot;&gt;Certified Information System Security Professional (CISSP), ISC2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CISSP Obtained: March 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love it or hate it, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP&quot;&gt;CISSP&lt;/a&gt; remains one of the industries most recognized and sought after certifications. Those who hold the cert tend to command &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Certification=Certified_Information_Systems_Security_Professional_(CISSP)/Salary&quot;&gt;high salaries&lt;/a&gt; and from what I‚Äôve seen, it seems to just make you more hirable in general. No, it‚Äôs not a practical cert and yes, taking the exam is kind of grueling but if you meet the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/experience-requirements&quot;&gt;pre-requisite qualifications&lt;/a&gt;, I &lt;strong&gt;definitely recommend&lt;/strong&gt; going for it. I recommend picking up a CISSP study-book on Amazon (back when I took it I used whatever the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-All-One-Guide-Eighth/dp/1260142655&quot;&gt;Shon Harris all-in-one guide&lt;/a&gt; was available) rather than signing up for some expensive boot camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exam has undergone some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Certifications/Exam-Outlines/CISSP-Exam-Outline-121417--Final.ashx&quot;&gt;drastic changes&lt;/a&gt; since I sat for it in 2016, now being only 3 hours (versus 6) and only have between 100-150 questions (which is far less than previous versions). This shortened format will definitely help those who would normally experience fatigue taking such a long exam. This being said, I will warn you that with less questions comes more weight with each question, so you must exercise a little more care with each question as any incorrect answer will count against you more. When I took the exam i found many questions to be worded poorly (as if not written by a native English speaker) and I often found scenario-based questions to be highly subjective, often looking for the ‚Äúbest‚Äù of several seemingly-equally-correct answers. This is one reason I recommend finding an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù study-guide and reading through it as part of your overall studying regimen, remembering to take any available practice tests that are contained in the book. I found, by reading through these guides, that there was a certain ‚ÄúCISSP‚Äù way of answering questions. This way of thinking, when applied to these scenario-based questions will more-often yield the correct answer then if you were to approach it from what I would consider a non-biased point of view. For example, there might be a question that asks you something like ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;As a security manager for a large banking organization, what is your highest priority?&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù. It will then list a number of possible answers, each of which seems potentially viable but one of the answers will be something about the ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;physical safety of the employees&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù. Of course the CISSP training wants to drill into your head that human safety is priority number one! Even if that seems somewhat irrelevant to an exam about Cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the high demand for CISSP-certified professionals, especially in certain job markets, it‚Äôs no surprise there are a lot of people, especially those more junior in the field, asking about and looking to take this exam. ISC2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/experience-requirements&quot;&gt;requires&lt;/a&gt; those who sit for the exam to have a minimum of 5 years of (relevant) experience (or optionally 4 years plus a relevant degree) and I think this makes sense. It certainly made my test-taking experience much smoother having this experience to lean on than if i had tried to power-study for it early in my career, having not truly understood and practiced the concepts in a real-world setting. Adding to this, I think I greatly benefited in having an extended background in the ‚Äúsofter‚Äù side of security (policy &amp;amp; compliance) early in my career coupled with a recent history in the more technical aspects of infosec. As a certification that attempts to cover basically ‚Äúall of security‚Äù, it shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise that having a well-rounded experience would lend itself to being more successful with the exam. To wrap this up, let me just summarize again by saying that I think &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;, more so than just remembering facts is particularly useful with this certification (I say this relative to other certification exams where I do think you can be successful just cramming facts into your head) given the nature of the scenario-based questions that are asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;penetration-testing-student-ejpt-elearnsecurity&quot;&gt;Penetration Testing Student (eJPT), eLearnSecurity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;eJPT Obtained: December 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elearnsecurity.com/course/penetration_testing_student/&quot;&gt;PTS&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elearnsecurity.com/&quot;&gt;eLearnSecurity&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively limited in scope, yet high-value course. With hours of video lectures, practical VPN-based labs and a self-paced style, I found it a really good format for learning this sort of technical material. What‚Äôs even better is this course can often be taken for &lt;strong&gt;FREE&lt;/strong&gt;, as eLearnSecurity has frequently given out vouchers for the course as part of different promotions or for something as simple as attending a free webinar (note that the exam attempt is not typically included with this free voucher). Where you can pick up a free voucher, I &lt;strong&gt;definitely recommend&lt;/strong&gt; going through the material, especially as a beginner. Otherwise, this course clocks in at about $400 and in this case I just &lt;strong&gt;don‚Äôt really recommend&lt;/strong&gt; it. Again, I think the material is great, but I think your money is better spent on a more comprehensive course like &lt;a href=&quot;#penetration-testing-professional-ecppt-elearnsecurity&quot;&gt;eLearnSecurity‚Äôs PTP&lt;/a&gt; course or the &lt;a href=&quot;#offensive-security-certified-professional-oscp&quot;&gt;OSCP&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, having ‚ÄúPenetration Testing Student‚Äù training or a certification titled ‚ÄúJunior Penetration Tester‚Äù from the lesser known eLearnSecurity on your resume is not likely to turn a lot of hiring manager/recruiter heads. You‚Äôll also get a far better curriculum by just spending your money on the more serious courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;penetration-testing-professional-ecppt-elearnsecurity&quot;&gt;Penetration Testing Professional (eCPPT), eLearnSecurity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;eCPPT Obtained: February 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elearnsecurity.com/course/penetration_testing/&quot;&gt;PTP&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic offering from the not-so-well-known online training provider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elearnsecurity.com/&quot;&gt;eLearnSecurity&lt;/a&gt;. This course can be thought of as eLearn‚Äôs direct competitor to the much more well-known &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/&quot;&gt;OSCP&lt;/a&gt; certification from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/&quot;&gt;Offensive Security&lt;/a&gt;. The PTP course covers a lot of technical ground including assemblers/debuggers, shellcoding, network pentesting, PowerShell, Linux exploitation, web apps, WiFi hacking and even has an in-depth ruby for pentesters module. The course material certainly shines in certain spots relative to the OSCP - modules on PowerShell, WiFI security and Ruby are not be found in the PWK curriculum (last I checked). The decision to take the PTP course is likely not made without asking, why should I take this over the PWK/OSCP? I‚Äôll attempt to make the case for both of these courses, providing my thoughts on each, below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest differences between the PTP and the OSCP in my opinion is the expectations of the student. OSCP is (in)famous for forcing its &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qphH73iIaw8&quot;&gt;‚ÄúTry Harder‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; mentality whereas the PTP takes a different approach. With the PTP, and similarly with other courses offered by eLearn, students are provided focused labs where the student can practice specific skills and techniques, taking a lot of the guesswork and trial-n-error out of the equation. I do think that this approach is a little ‚Äúhand-holdy‚Äù which I believe &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be detrimental to full absorption of the concepts. I found that I &lt;em&gt;failed&lt;/em&gt; less in achieving the desired outcome within these labs and as a result learned less about the ways things &lt;em&gt;didn‚Äôt work&lt;/em&gt;. Though ultimately far more frustrating, there is a method-to-the-madness with the OSCP approach. Where you are forced to figure it out yourself, I believe you really will learn the material in a much more robust way. You‚Äôll also, as a consequence of having to ‚Äútry harder‚Äù, frequently end up down rabbit holes where you learn all sorts of stuff that doesn‚Äôt end up being applicable to your ultimate solution, but its gained knowledge all the same. All this said, I think the eLearn approach might be better suited to &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; personal learning style. The PTP lab environment, which is essentially a series of individual exercises, each with specific lab systems for that exercise, is a less &lt;em&gt;realistic&lt;/em&gt; method of practicing penetration testing techniques as compared to the PWK/OSCP. The PWK/OSCP sports a large, open, multi-layered, ‚Äúwild-west‚Äù-style lab network, comprised of many different interconnected systems. Having a large heterogenous network such as this is more realistic in terms of simulating an actual network. Where I think the PTP gains back ground on the OSCP is that the exercises/content/exam is (in my opinion) far more &lt;em&gt;modern&lt;/em&gt;. Specifically, you do a lot of hackery in a Windows Active Directory environment with the PTP which I found lacking in the OSCP. Finally, I think the PTP exam unlike the OSCP exam, is a better representation of a realistic (albeit mini-) network in which you need to compromise. This is a little funny considering the OSCP had the far more realistic lab setting but when it comes to the exam they seem to regress. The OSCP is essentially just a series of 5 CTF boxes whereas the PTP requires breaching a machine in a ‚ÄúDMZ‚Äù, then pivoting into other internal networks and performing subsequent exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here‚Äôs where I stand on PTP vs OSCP: It‚Äôs difficult to recommend one over the other as they both have certain strengths and weaknesses.  I &lt;strong&gt;recommend&lt;/strong&gt; the PTP for its sheer breadth of awesome material, which is brought more directly to you rather than having to find it yourself. I also think the PTP exam better exercises your ability to do real penetration testing given you actually have to do pivoting (among other things not experienced during the OSCP exam). Another example of how I think the PTP exam excels over the OSCP is the duration and reporting aspect of these exams. It‚Äôs not terribly realistic that you would be asked to do a penetration test in 24 hours followed by delivering a full report after an additional 24 hours (which is what is asked of you in the OSCP). In my experience, you will have more time to perform the engagement and provide the deliverables. As such, the PTP exam is a week long, with an additional week to provide the report. I do think the PTP is a great complement to the OSCP though, rather than a ‚Äúchoose one or the other‚Äù. However if you can only choose one, I would still ultimately give the edge to the OSCP. The huge lab environment is both challenging and exhilarating - an amazing playground for an offensive student. Though I think the material is a bit outdated, I think the most important thing taught by the OSCP is the mentality and methodology. You learn, &lt;em&gt;by trying harder&lt;/em&gt; (and &lt;strong&gt;enumerating a lot&lt;/strong&gt;), a more realistic way to breach systems and networks. The experience of failure and the determination you must bring to the OSCP fight can‚Äôt be understated and it is absolutely a skill you‚Äôll need for real-life penetration testing. Also, and this is probably the most important point, the OSCP is (currently) the far more recognized and sought after certification by hiring managers and recruiters. That alone is reason enough to choose the OSCP over the PTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: March 2017, GCIA Obtained: July 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, I probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend most 500-level &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/&quot;&gt;SANS&lt;/a&gt; courses. &lt;a href=&quot;#thoughts-on-sans-training-and-giac-certification-exams&quot;&gt;They‚Äôre expensive&lt;/a&gt; and I personally believe you can find most if not all of what is covered in the course searching online. With that said, I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/intrusion-detection-in-depth/&quot;&gt;SEC503&lt;/a&gt; could be the exception to that rule. Yes, I still think you can find a good bit of this material online, but I think in this case it would be far more difficult to self-administer it. This course, an undeniably ‚Äúblue‚Äù / defensive security course, which preps you for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/certification/certified-intrusion-analyst-gcia&quot;&gt;GCIA&lt;/a&gt; exam is by far my favorite SANS course that I have taken - and this is coming from someone who is an offensive security specialist by trade! I credit my infatuation with the course to the following three points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time I took this training, TCP/IP and general networking concepts were weaker knowledge areas for me, so I really just learned SO MUCH during this course. Much of my early technical focus was on web applications or using certain tools for network penetration testing. I glossed over in those early times, the importance of understanding what is happening at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model&quot;&gt;layers&lt;/a&gt; 2-4. This course cleared that up for me &lt;em&gt;and then some&lt;/em&gt;. This course has two distinct sections (spread out over the course of 5 days of lecture) - traffic analysis and then tooling. As someone more on the ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù side, my need to (or desire to) understand a lot of the defensive tooling was certainly minimized back then. Where I found the extreme value, was days one and two where you go deep (and I mean &lt;em&gt;DEEP&lt;/em&gt;!) into traffic analysis, packet dissection, understanding of protocols, etc‚Ä¶ It is an undeniably dense and information-packed two days but I think one of the best two days of learning I have ever experienced. As for the final 3 days, though I didn‚Äôt appreciate it as much then, I now have a much greater appreciation for what was covered. This is a great example of how I discounted certain things early in my career because I didn‚Äôt think it was relevant to where I wanted to go professionally. Years later I can see that even as an ‚Äúoffensive specialist‚Äù understanding exactly how defender tools (e.g. Snort, Bro/Zeek, SIEMs, SiLK, NetFlow, etc‚Ä¶) work is extremely important. Whether this be because you are trying to bypass these tools or you are looking to set them up in a home/test lab so you can practice &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; them - it‚Äôs good to know how they work. What‚Äôs more, I have found that slotting in, in a perfect, exclusively ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù role, where all I do is pentest or red team is easier said than done. More likely, at least in my experience, is you‚Äôll need to have experience (especially in an engineering capacity) with tools across the security space, from red to blue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The material for this training is fantastic and I think a little more challenging to find for yourself online then perhaps other courses. Sure you could buy yourself a book on TCP/IP, this of course would be a perfectly acceptable approach to learning some of this material! But, I think the the course content has been perfectly cropped here for both offensive and defensive security professionals alike to get a firm understanding of how to interpret network traffic and leverage a number of well-known industry tools.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My instructor for the course was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/profiles/jonathan-ham/&quot;&gt;Jonathan Ham&lt;/a&gt;. He did such an outstanding job making something as seemingly dry as in-depth packet analysis so interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still think spending $7000+ is not worth it for any individual paying out-of-pocket but if you do get a chance to take a SANS cert through work, desperately want to pay for a SANS cert yourself or maybe you get accepted to a SANS &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/work-study/&quot;&gt;workstudy&lt;/a&gt;, I would &lt;strong&gt;highly recommend&lt;/strong&gt; taking a look at this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: May 2017, GPYC Obtained: August 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not spend money on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/automating-information-security-with-python/&quot;&gt;this course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Don‚Äôt even let your company spend money on this course. This course isn‚Äôt meant to be an ‚Äúintroduction to python‚Äù, yet they spend two straight days painstakingly explaining the basics. For anyone who has even mild experience with Python, this is excruciating. After the first two days, the material definitely gets more interesting, but nothing is covered in these final modules that isn‚Äôt equally covered in any number of very cheap books. The book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Violent-Python-Cookbook-Penetration-Engineers/dp/1597499579&quot;&gt;Violent Python&lt;/a&gt; is actually handed out in the class (as part of your $7k+ tuition) and has plenty of what is covered in those final three days of lecture. Do yourself a favor and just Google ‚Äúlearn python‚Äù and follow a few of the online tutorials. This should satisfy the basics requirement (what is covered in days 1 and 2). From there, buy a ‚Äúpython hacking‚Äù book or two (e.g. The Violent Python book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Black-Hat-Python-Programming-Pentesters/dp/1593275900&quot;&gt;Black Hat Python&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Gray-Hat-Python-Programming-Engineers/dp/1593271921&quot;&gt;Gray Hat Python&lt;/a&gt;, etc‚Ä¶) to learn how to use cool security-related modules (e.g. requests, scapy, struct, sockets, etc‚Ä¶). Here is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/best-python-books/&quot;&gt;assortment of other books&lt;/a&gt; that you can use to teach yourself Python. Just please, don‚Äôt spend money on this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;don‚Äôt recommend&lt;/strong&gt; recommend taking this course. The material is interesting enough but it suffers from the pace in which the mobile world moves. Given the speed in which features are added to the iOS and Android platforms it is difficult to maintain a cutting-edge mobile device hacking course - and it shows. What‚Äôs more, its difficult to really demonstrate iOS security concepts given how locked down the platform is and how uncertain it is whether there will be an active &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking&quot;&gt;Jailbreak&lt;/a&gt; (which can be used to install iOS-related security tools and demonstrate other security things). For this reason, this course centers mostly around the Android platform. To this course‚Äôs credit though, I did find it pretty cool how much more approachable mobile device hacking/security was than I had imagined. I think this course is one of SANS‚Äô more neglected offerings in terms of how frequently it is updated and that‚Äôs too bad considering how mobile devices have become more a part of everyone‚Äôs daily computing lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;offensive-security-certified-professional-oscp&quot;&gt;Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OSCP Obtained: July 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I provide some details on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=oscp&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;hl=en-us&amp;amp;client=safari&quot;&gt;OSCP&lt;/a&gt; in my &lt;a href=&quot;#penetration-testing-professional-ecppt-elearnsecurity&quot;&gt;review of eLearnSecurity‚Äôs PTP course&lt;/a&gt;, but I will expand on the (PWK) course more here. First, let me say that I &lt;strong&gt;highly recommend&lt;/strong&gt; this course for all security professionals. I think this is an obvious choice for those looking to get into penetration testing and I would even recommend those in ‚Äúdefensive‚Äù security positions take a look at this course. After all, what better way to understand how to defend then understanding how your systems may be attacked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so you don‚Äôt really need me to tell you that the OSCP is a great certification and the PWK is an excellent course, nor do you really need yet another full OSCP review. After all, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=oscp+review&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;hl=en-us&amp;amp;client=safari&quot;&gt;TONS of reviews&lt;/a&gt; already out there. Instead, let me list a few thoughts and pieces of advice I have related to the OSCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The exam (mostly) forbids the use of exploit frameworks such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metasploit.com/&quot;&gt;Metasploit&lt;/a&gt; or vulnerability scanners such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-professional&quot;&gt;Nessus&lt;/a&gt;. Many OSCP students take this as a cue to try and get through the entire lab without the use of these sorts of tools. I don‚Äôt recommend this. Not because Metasploit or Nessus or similar tools are so useful that they will give you a serious leg up but rather these tools are good to know how to use in general! Why not take the time to learn how to use them? The lab is a fantastic place to try your hand with all sorts of tools and techniques so you should really take full advantage. To compensate however, where you did leverage a tool like Metasploit or Nessus, figure out how you would have exploited a system, or enumerated a system in the absence of these tools. In this way, you‚Äôll still feel fully comfortable come exam time. Don‚Äôt NOT use them just because the &lt;em&gt;exam&lt;/em&gt; dictates you can‚Äôt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a clarification, the OSCP (at least when I took it) allowed the use of &lt;em&gt;ONE&lt;/em&gt; metasploit module (so fire wisely). It also allows you to use the Metasploit session management features (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/handler&quot;&gt;multi-handler&lt;/a&gt;), with no limits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The PWK lab has a LOT of vulnerable systems, it‚Äôs important that you manage and maintain records of what you‚Äôve found on each of these systems including open ports, credentials and other important artifacts. There are any number of tools/methodologies that can assist in this endeavor but I recommend you take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/using-databases/&quot;&gt;MSFDB&lt;/a&gt; functionality offered natively by Metasploit. This can help you keep track of things.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take screenshots! Lots of screenshots! You‚Äôll need this for the lab report, you‚Äôll need it for the exam report, you‚Äôll need it for future professional penetration test reports. Screenshots are good, get used to taking them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I recommend going through BOTH the PWK PDF and the videos before seriously getting into the lab itself. This is what I did and I found it more comforting to know what Offsec wanted me to know vs what I needed to hunt for myself (as part of their ever-so-fun game of ‚Äútry harder‚Äù).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The exam does not require any pivoting. You should absolutely practice this in the lab but won‚Äôt need it come test time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don‚Äôt worry about pwning every box in the lab. Getting through &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; amount of boxes isn‚Äôt a sign that you are ready. I got through about 30 which was more than enough!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I think the OSCP is mostly a positive experience but I do think that it is very ‚ÄúCTF‚Äù-ey. Which is to say, less like hacking a real modern network and more like doing a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackthebox.eu/&quot;&gt;hack-the-box&lt;/a&gt; challenges. Make the most of it though! It can be really fun if you‚Äôre in the mindset of learning rather than just ‚Äúgetting the cert‚Äù.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec504-hacker-tools-techniques-exploits-and-incident-handling-gcih-sans&quot;&gt;SEC504: Hacker Tools, Techniques, Exploits and Incident Handling (GCIH), SANS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GCIH Obtained: December 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/hacker-techniques-exploits-incident-handling/&quot;&gt;SEC504&lt;/a&gt; is SANS most popular course. It is designed to be approachable for both semi-experienced professionals as well as to those new to the field and covers both offensive and defensive security domains. I did not actually take the course but I did challenge the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.giac.org/certification/certified-incident-handler-gcih&quot;&gt;GCIH&lt;/a&gt; exam which accompanies the course. Personally (and again, I did not actually take the course), I &lt;strong&gt;would not recommend&lt;/strong&gt; this course as I think it tries to cover too much ground in too short of time. The course attempts to cover network attacks, incident handling, memory analysis, malware investigations, offensive tooling, network analysis, physical security, network scanning AND web application attacks‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;all in 6 days&lt;/em&gt;. You get a brief intro to each of these topics (the course does have a day with a heavy focus in Incident Handling) but I don‚Äôt think it covers any of them at the depth you would want given you payed $7000+ to take the course. Of course given its popularity, if getting this cert helps you land a specific entry-level position, then absolutely go for it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec401-security-essentials-gsec-sans&quot;&gt;SEC401: Security Essentials (GSEC), SANS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSEC Obtained: February 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/security-essentials-bootcamp-style/&quot;&gt;SEC401&lt;/a&gt; is SANS‚Äô ‚Äúmile wide and an inch deep‚Äù course. I like to compare its accompanying cert, the GSEC, to the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP&quot;&gt;ISC2 CISSP&lt;/a&gt; certification (which I also &lt;a href=&quot;#certified-information-system-security-professional-cissp-isc2&quot;&gt;have some thoughts on&lt;/a&gt;). I did not actually take this course but I did challenge the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/certification/security-essentials-gsec&quot;&gt;GSEC&lt;/a&gt; exam. Given the price, I &lt;strong&gt;don‚Äôt think I can really recommend&lt;/strong&gt; this course. If you‚Äôre interested in getting a lay-of-the-(infosec)-land, I recommend looking into some free ‚Äúintro to security‚Äù courses online or even looking at study books for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security&quot;&gt;Security+&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP&quot;&gt;CISSP&lt;/a&gt;. Either of these should get you acquainted enough with the foundational concepts of information security. Both of these (CISSP and Sec+) are also great (cheaper) options for a certification well-respected in the industry. The GSEC certification I don‚Äôt think is going to move the needle on impressing any recruiters (no more than the Sec+ or CISSP that is) and the course material is probably easy enough to find online or via some cheap text books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec542-web-app-penetration-testing-and-ethical-hacking-gwapt-sans&quot;&gt;SEC542: Web App Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking (GWAPT), SANS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GWAPT Obtained: March 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/web-app-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking/&quot;&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; is an introduction to web-application-specific penetration testing. I did not take the course but I did challenge the accompanying &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.giac.org/certification/web-application-penetration-tester-gwapt&quot;&gt;GWAPT&lt;/a&gt; certification exam. Similar to my &lt;a href=&quot;#sec560-network-penetration-testing-and-ethical-hacking-gpen-sans&quot;&gt;GPEN review&lt;/a&gt;, I &lt;strong&gt;don‚Äôt recommend&lt;/strong&gt; this course as it doesn‚Äôt provide a format conducive to really learning penetration testing. For learning penetration testing, I would recommend a more practical approach. Not that SANS doesn‚Äôt have practical exercises and in-training labs, it‚Äôs just that these labs fly by so quickly during the course of the training that you really don‚Äôt have time to fail, and failing is a great way to learn. Instead I would recommend a more practical course such as the eLearnSecurity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elearnsecurity.com/course/web_application_penetration_testing/&quot;&gt;WAPT&lt;/a&gt; course. With the current popularity of ‚Äúbug bounty hunting‚Äù and penetration testing in general, there is certainly an abundance of free or cheap web-application hacking training material out there. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://portswigger.net/web-security&quot;&gt;Web Security Academy&lt;/a&gt; from the famed &lt;a href=&quot;https://portswigger.net/&quot;&gt;PortSwigger&lt;/a&gt; (creator of &lt;a href=&quot;https://portswigger.net/burp&quot;&gt;Burp Suite&lt;/a&gt;) is just one example of this. More examples of free/cheap online training material for web application penetration testing can be found in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/online-training#web-application-security&quot;&gt;guide to free/online training&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;for610-reverse-engineering-malware-grem-sans&quot;&gt;FOR610: Reverse-Engineering Malware (GREM), SANS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: May 2019, GREM Obtained: July 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this course is fantastic! I took this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/blog/sans-for610-reverse-engineering-malware-now-with-ghidra/&quot;&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; prior to it‚Äôs adoption of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghidra-sre.org/&quot;&gt;Ghidra&lt;/a&gt; so I can‚Äôt speak for the new content but the instructors do a fantastic job getting through some of the trickier concepts (even for those new to the world of reverse-engineering). Unlike other SANS courses, especially penetration testing courses, I felt by the end of this training I could actually do real-world, practical, malware reverse-engineering. I should mention that prior to taking the course, I did have some background in assembly language and reverse-engineering but I still feel that anyone who dutifully gets through all of the material in this class could similarly feel ready to do some real malware reversing. For anyone interested in getting into malware reverse-engineering, I definitely recommend checking this course out. Paying full price for this class however is where I would be a little &lt;strong&gt;hesitant to recommend&lt;/strong&gt; as I do think there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elearnsecurity.com/course/category-reverse-engineering&quot;&gt;cheaper options&lt;/a&gt; out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to reemphasize here that you‚Äôre probably best set up to succeed having a little knowledge about assembly (specifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/intel-assembly-primer#title&quot;&gt;Intel assembly&lt;/a&gt;) prior to sitting for this course. This isn‚Äôt explicitly listed on the ‚ÄúPrerequisites‚Äù section for the course by SANS but having taken this class with a coworker who did not have much experience in this area, watching some of their struggles really emphasized this point. Check out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/intel-assembly-primer#title&quot;&gt;primer on intel assembly&lt;/a&gt; or dive right into &lt;a href=&quot;https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-sdm.html&quot;&gt;Intel‚Äôs own manuals&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in getting prepped!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ics515-ics-active-defense-and-incident-response-grid-sans&quot;&gt;ICS515: ICS Active Defense and Incident Response (GRID), SANS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: July 2019, GRID Obtained: November 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SANS &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/industrial-control-system-active-defense-and-incident-response/&quot;&gt;ICS515&lt;/a&gt; is a bit of a niche course, covering incident response techniques as well as knowledge and tooling specific to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/operational-technology-ot&quot;&gt;OT&lt;/a&gt; environments. First, I‚Äôll say I &lt;strong&gt;probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend&lt;/strong&gt; spending (your own) money on this course. At the point in which I took this course I had already taken 10+ SANS courses and as such, found that this course had a lot of similarities, things seemingly plucked from each of these other courses and made available in this course, albeit with a distinct ICS-flavor. There is a section on asset discovery and network security monitoring (NSM), reminiscent of both the SANS &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/event/san-francisco-spring-2020/course/enterprise-threat-vulnerability-assessment: Threat and Vulnerability Assessment&quot;&gt;SEC460&lt;/a&gt; and SANS &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/intrusion-detection-in-depth/: Intrusion Detection&quot;&gt;SEC503&lt;/a&gt; courses. There is a section on Incident Response, which echoes material taught in SANS &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/hacker-techniques-exploits-incident-handling/ : Incident Handling&quot;&gt;SEC504&lt;/a&gt;. There is a section titled ‚ÄúThreat and Environment Manipulation‚Äù which focuses on ICS malware case-studies as well as malware analysis. This section contains plenty of material from SANS &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/reverse-engineering-malware-malware-analysis-tools-techniques/ : Reverse Engineering &amp;amp; Malware Analysis&quot;&gt;FOR610&lt;/a&gt;. The newest content to me (having not taken a course related to it) was covered in day one of the course, focusing specifically on ‚ÄúThreat Intelligence‚Äù. Though SANS also has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/cyber-threat-intelligence/&quot;&gt;course dedicated to threat intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, I found this introduction to threat intel, as applied to ICS environments a good primer on the subject, covering the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/ICS/paper/36297&quot;&gt;(ICS) Cyber Kill Chain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.nsa.gov/iaarchive/programs/iad-initiatives/active-cyber-defense.cfm&quot;&gt;Active Defense&lt;/a&gt;, Intelligence Life-Cycle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recordedfuture.com/diamond-model-intrusion-analysis&quot;&gt;Diamond Model&lt;/a&gt; and more. Overall, my biggest takeaways from this course were from this first day but having a unique interest in ICS security, I found the entire course pretty fascinating, despite a lot of the material being a rehash of similar content from other courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec660-advanced-penetration-testing-exploit-writing-and-ethical-hacking-gxpn-sans&quot;&gt;SEC660: Advanced Penetration Testing, Exploit Writing and Ethical Hacking (GXPN), SANS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: November 2019, GXPN Obtained: August 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/ondemand/course/advanced-penetration-testing-exploits-ethical-hacking&quot;&gt;SEC660&lt;/a&gt; is SANS advanced penetration testing and intro to exploit writing course. I will echo what I have said about other SANS penetration testing courses and say that I don‚Äôt think that the format of this course is ideal for teaching penetration testing. Rapidly going lab-to-lab and lecture-to-lecture, with little time to actually practice the offensive techniques is not a great way to really learn and practice penetration testing. With that said, I do think the topics covered are really good with respect to the more advanced types of network pentesting. Where this class shines in particular is the final two days where you break into exploit writing for both Linux and Windows. Though I think the exercises are a little limited, I do think they are a great introduction to the world of exploit development for these respective platforms. I think for those interested in getting into exploit development, this is a decent place to start (though it is, as usual with SANS, an expensive option). With this said, I think ‚Äúadvanced network penetration testing‚Äù and ‚Äúexploit development‚Äù are really two different disciplines and SANS may have been better served to separate them into two distinct courses. I think a lot of professional penetration testers don‚Äôt need to have exploit writing skills and vice versa. In the overwhelming majority of penetration testing engagements, you likely don‚Äôt have time to write your own exploits or find zero-days. Conversely though, understanding already-written exploits and thus being able to modify exploit code on the fly is a great skill for your average penetration tester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this ‚Äúmini-review‚Äù, I wanted to share some thoughts on the ‚Äúpractical‚Äù portions of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/certification/exploit-researcher-advanced-penetration-tester-gxpn&quot;&gt;GXPN&lt;/a&gt; exam. Prior to taking on this course, and during the prep-time for the certification, the (partial) practical nature of this certification was something that was always on my mind. It certainly changed the way I prepared for the exam since I knew I‚Äôd need to actually put my knowledge to actual use, rather than simply regurgitate/recall random facts/concepts as is the case with most other GIAC exams. This exam, unlike most GIAC exams (though they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/blog/hands-on-real-world-testing&quot;&gt;moving more exams&lt;/a&gt; to this partially-practical format) has a small number of questions (6 in my case) which require actually remoting into a lab environment and doing some sort of actual ‚Äúhacking‚Äù relevant to the course material. Knowing this, I spent much more time than I had with previous certifications (the advanced nature of the material also was a factor for time-spent studying) prepping for the exam. I expected these questions to be difficult and to be centered primarily around the exploit development/reverse-engineering (the more challenging) aspects of the course. What I found was that neither of these things ended up being true (at least in my opinion/experience). The questions were straight-forward (which is not always the case with the multiple-choice, scenario based questions you often find on GIAC exams), relatively easy and did not take that long to complete. I also was surprised to see that the majority of the questions (atleast on my instance of the exam) were not actually related to days 5 and 6 (which cover exploit writing). It‚Äôs also important to note that for those questions that were covering days 5 and 6 material, none of them were particularly in-depth. Given the time-constrained nature of the exam, the exam authors can‚Äôt expect people to be putting together full ROP chains now can they!? In short, study the material, try to really grasp the concepts for the sake of grasping the concepts - but don‚Äôt sweat the practical exam questions, they aren‚Äôt that bad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec617-wireless-penetration-testing-and-ethical-hacking-gawn-sans&quot;&gt;SEC617: Wireless Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking (GAWN), SANS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GAWN Obtained: November 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SANS‚Äô advanced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/wireless-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking/&quot;&gt;wireless penetration testing course&lt;/a&gt; offers an amazingly practical introduction to an array of RF technologies and how you can exploit them. This training covers traditional WiFi, DECT, ZigBee, a couple Bluetooth variants, RFID, NFC and even Software Defined Radio (at a high level). Included with the expectedly high entry fee is a box - yes, an entire BOX! - of cool hacking gadgets to use throughout the various hands on labs - bluetooth dongles, SDR, a Raspberry Pi, RFID badge cloner and more‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for me, I took this class in 2020 - best known for being an amazingly crappy year on a global level and more specifically, infamous for the global Covid-19 pandemic. For me, this meant taking the class via SANS On-Demand. Up until then, I had never taken an on-demand course from SANS, opting instead for in-person trainings for each of the courses I had taken prior. In a vacuum, I found the on-demand format to be pretty good. The physical books are mailed to you as well as available via your SANS portal as a digital .PDF and the video lectures are pre-recorded, typically by the course author themselves as well as downloadable so you can watch them anywhere. Where the on-demand format falls short, especially for this course is with labs. In typical a classroom setting, the instructor will have set up a physical lab environment in which the students can practice their hacking skills. With a class which requires an active medium (actual ZigBee buzzing around for example) in which to hack, which is not easily delivered in virtual form, the practical components of the course proved far more difficult to exercise. Ultimately, I &lt;strong&gt;do recommend this course&lt;/strong&gt; for anyone looking to learn more about wireless hacking but I would advise that those interested hold off on taking the course until they are able to do so in a physical classroom setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate&quot;&gt;AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obtained: November 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of the online training platform &lt;a href=&quot;https://acloudguru.com&quot;&gt;A Cloud Guru&lt;/a&gt;, I sat for and passed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/&quot;&gt;AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate&lt;/a&gt; exam. I give a lot of credit to this training platform for my success and would recommend others interested in taking this exam take a look at signing up. It‚Äôs not an overwhelmingly cheap service but it is far more economical than a lot of other training platforms (*cough* SANS *cough*) and the RoI on getting an AWS cert seems to be pretty high these days. The virtual video lectures provide both theoretical instruction as well as hands-on, practical labs that you can follow along with. The instructor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kroonenburgryan?lang=en&quot;&gt;Ryan Kroonenburg&lt;/a&gt;, does a great job at walking you through the labs and alerting you if something you spin up in your AWS account would result in you seeing actual charges. The Solutions Architect curriculum is essentially just a high level speed-run of a large number of core AWS services (IAM, S3, EC2, RDS, VPC, ELB, SNS, SQS, Kinesis and Lambda to name a few of the big ones.) You‚Äôre expected to know what each of these are at a relatively good technical depth, how they interact and when you would use each of them. The exam questions are mostly scenario-based and at times can be confusing and subjective though typically you can figure out the best answer by slowly using the process of elimination to rule out certain answers that can‚Äôt be true due to some small detail contained within the question prompt or the answer itself. I also recommend those who are prepping for the exam to buy some practice exams from a site like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com&quot;&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt; as I found these very useful in just getting a feel for what the actual exam questions would be like. At 65 questions and a passing score of 720 (out of 1000), the exam doesn‚Äôt leave too much room for error so be sure to really think through each of the scenario-based questions. Given the popularity of ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù in modern enterprises, taking training and picking up this certification seemed like a very good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aws-certified-security-specialty&quot;&gt;AWS Certified Security Specialty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obtained: December 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after picking up the &lt;a href=&quot;#aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate&quot;&gt;solutions architect associate&lt;/a&gt;, I spun up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://acloudguru.com&quot;&gt;A Cloud Guru&lt;/a&gt; video lecture series for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty/&quot;&gt;AWS Certified Security Specialty&lt;/a&gt; and began prepping for the security specialty exam. Given this exam was more specific to ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù within AWS, and given my extensive security background, I expected this exam to actually be easier than the solutions architect. &lt;em&gt;This assumption proved mostly false&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, the exam does cover &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; topics and services than the solutions architect exam but the understanding you must have requires quite a bit more technical depth. With this said, I do think my years of security experience came in handy with a few questions. The A Cloud Guru course covers the security aspects of S3, Identity Federation, CloudFront, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Config, Inspector, Trusted Advisor, VPC, NAT, ELB, WAF, Shield, API Gateway, Athena, Macie, SES, Artifact and Lambda (and maybe a few more) - with a heavy, and I mean &lt;strong&gt;HEAVY&lt;/strong&gt; focus on both IAM and KMS. I found that well over half of the questions on the security specialty exam asked very challenging, scenario-based questions related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/iam/&quot;&gt;IAM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/kms/&quot;&gt;KMS&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, I thought the course from A Cloud Guru was great and I certainly learned a lot. However, having now taken (and &lt;em&gt;luckily&lt;/em&gt; PASSED) the exam, I can say that this course does not really cover all the topics needed to &lt;strong&gt;comfortably&lt;/strong&gt; pass the exam. In some cases, more depth seemed to be required, and in other cases, there was simply something not covered at all. I don‚Äôt fault A Cloud Guru though as AWS is notorious for adding more and more services and functionality to their platform all the time and the specialty exam DOES recommend that those who sit for the exam have 2 years+ experience securing workloads in AWS. So don‚Äôt expect this course to be your one-stop-shop for easily passing this exam. Listed below are some of the gaps I think the course had with respect to the exam questions I encountered as well as some other general tips for what to put emphasis on when studying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Really understand how to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html&quot;&gt;IAM policies&lt;/a&gt;. I found many questions asking me about very specific policy statement syntax. This was doubly true for conditional statements within these policies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Though this is covered pretty well by the A Cloud Guru course, it deserves special mention here. REALLY understand how to &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cross-account-access-s3/&quot;&gt;share S3 buckets cross-account&lt;/a&gt;. You WILL get several questions asking about this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are a few in-depth questions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation/&quot;&gt;web identity federation&lt;/a&gt; not really covered well enough in the course.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Truly understand the differences between &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/&quot;&gt;Inspector&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/&quot;&gt;Trusted Advisor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/config/&quot;&gt;Config&lt;/a&gt;. You will be asked which of these is the right service for a specific objective and I found these questions somewhat challenging. I also thought Config had a particularly heavy focus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/awesome-cloud/aws-difference-between-cloudwatch-and-cloudtrail-16a486f8bc95&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/&quot;&gt;CloudTrail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html&quot;&gt;CloudWatch Logs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were some very specific questions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/&quot;&gt;CloudHSM&lt;/a&gt; I felt weren‚Äôt covered well by the course. Try to read some &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/07/aws-cloudhsm-backups-can-now-be-copied-across-regions/&quot;&gt;AWS documentation on CloudHSM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;KMS, KMS, KMS, KMS. So much &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/kms/&quot;&gt;KMS&lt;/a&gt;. You will be asked &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; 30 questions on KMS. Really understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html&quot;&gt;key rotation&lt;/a&gt;, how to provision &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/iam-policies.html&quot;&gt;access to keys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/determining-access-key-policy.html&quot;&gt;key policies&lt;/a&gt;, administering keys and everything else to do with KMS. Read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/kms/faqs/&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-kms-best-practices.pdf&quot;&gt;whitepapers&lt;/a&gt;, read everything you can on KMS, understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-modifying-external-accounts.html&quot;&gt;cross-account KMS access&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html&quot;&gt;KMS Grants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I had a question on taking memory dumps from an EC2 instance. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=ssm+memory+dump+ec2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&quot;&gt;I think SSM covers this&lt;/a&gt;. The course doesn‚Äôt get into this I don‚Äôt think.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The course covers this well, but there are a good number of questions related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Security.html&quot;&gt;Security Groups, NACLs and Route Tables&lt;/a&gt;. Understand the in‚Äôs and out‚Äôs (&lt;em&gt;get it?&lt;/em&gt;) of these controls.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-permissions.html&quot;&gt;Function Policies vs Execution Roles&lt;/a&gt; for Lambda.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-federated-authentication-with-active-directory-federation-services-ad-fs/&quot;&gt;AD Federation&lt;/a&gt; sequence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cnames-and-https-requirements.html&quot;&gt;using certificates with CloudFront&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this said, I really enjoyed the course from A Cloud Guru and though I found the exam challenging, I think the questions were relevant and a good exercise of my AWS security knowledge. Remember to take your time with scenario-based questions and really try to rule out questions based on why they CAN‚ÄôT be the answer. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec588-cloud-penetration-testing-gcpn-sans&quot;&gt;SEC588: Cloud Penetration Testing (GCPN), SANS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GCPN Obtained: April 2021&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#updated-gcpn-review-8272022&quot;&gt;Attended: August 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: This review contains my &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; impressions of the course, I also have an &lt;a href=&quot;#updated-gcpn-review-8272022&quot;&gt;updated review&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org&quot;&gt;SANS&lt;/a&gt; continues to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/new-sans-courses&quot;&gt;expand their portfolio of courses&lt;/a&gt;, and within these new offerings is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/cloud-penetration-testing/&quot;&gt;SEC588: Cloud Penetration Testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. ‚ÄúCloud penetration testing‚Äù is at a‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; point in my opinion and I think this is evident in the makeup of this course. SANS does their best to differentiate how ‚Äúcloud‚Äù pentesting is different than traditional network/webapp pentesting but really, there isn‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much difference and even they admit this within the course material. Sure, the course authors key in on certain things that are more effective in cloud environments for performing reconnaissance and enumeration (among a few other things), but for the most part, nothing &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; changes here as it compares to traditional network/webapp testing. At the end of the day, you‚Äôre still using &lt;a href=&quot;https://nmap.org&quot;&gt;Nmap&lt;/a&gt; for port scanning, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metasploit.com&quot;&gt;Metasploit&lt;/a&gt; for payloads, etc‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud native applications as defined by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cncf.io&quot;&gt;CNCF&lt;/a&gt; (and as introduced by SANS) heavily leverage containers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-cicd.html&quot;&gt;CI/CD&lt;/a&gt; tooling, container orchestration (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;) and APIs/microservices. This course spends a good deal of time covering the security and pentesting aspects of these technologies. This is all great stuff but I think a full course on container pentesting - or webapp pentesting which focuses on APIs/microservices might be better than covering &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; these topics so briefly. The course also seems to heavily favor &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; instead of equally featuring other cloud providers. There is actually &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; day where &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com&quot;&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt; is covered but this really feels like only an introduction. Oh and there‚Äôs no mention of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com&quot;&gt;GCP&lt;/a&gt; that I can remember at all. By the time you get to Day 5 (Exploitation and Red Team in the Cloud) the course authors really start to run out of ideas as they pivot (literally) from &lt;em&gt;attacking the cloud&lt;/em&gt; to using the cloud itself to stage attacks from (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/proxycannon/proxycannon-ng&quot;&gt;proxycannon&lt;/a&gt;, cloud-based C2, &lt;a href=&quot;https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat&quot;&gt;tcp redirectors&lt;/a&gt;, etc‚Ä¶) Though this is &lt;em&gt;really cool&lt;/em&gt; stuff for sure, I think it makes more sense for a &lt;a href=&quot;#sans-sec564-red-team-operations-and-threat-emulation&quot;&gt;course on red-teaming&lt;/a&gt; (still waiting on the 6-day redteaming course from SANS!) than it does a cloud pentesting course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I feel this course introduces a lot of interesting topics but doesn‚Äôt cover any at a technical depth that I think they could have in 5 days had they taken out some of the unnecessary things and focused a little more on core material. In the end, I did enjoy the course and &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; able to achieve the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/certification/cloud-penetration-tester-gcpn&quot;&gt;GCPN certification&lt;/a&gt; but I &lt;strong&gt;don‚Äôt think I would recommend&lt;/strong&gt; this course to others at this time. Instead, I would suggest those who are interested in learning more about cloud penetration testing take a look at some books on the subject (for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/AWS-Penetration-Testing-Beginners-Metasploit/dp/1839216921&quot;&gt;AWS Penetration Testing&lt;/a&gt;), blog posts or other &lt;a href=&quot;https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/cloud-security/aws-security-vulnerabilities-perspective/&quot;&gt;offensive cloud research&lt;/a&gt; that is only a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/?q=cloud%20penetration%20testing&quot;&gt;quick google search&lt;/a&gt; away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;updated-gcpn-review-8272022&quot;&gt;Updated GCPN Review (8/27/2022)&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to re-take &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/cloud-penetration-testing/&quot;&gt;this class&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a virtual Teaching Assistant (&lt;strong&gt;vTA&lt;/strong&gt;) and I felt a re-review was warranted. Though this class is still &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; a mile-wide and an inch-deep in the context of cloud security / pentesting / etc‚Ä¶ I think a lot of really great updates have been made since I &lt;a href=&quot;#sec588-cloud-penetration-testing-gcpn-sans&quot;&gt;first sat for the course&lt;/a&gt;. When I first took the course, I believe I did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/ondemand/&quot;&gt;SANS OnDemand&lt;/a&gt; version, whereas this time I took it via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/mlp/live-online-training/&quot;&gt;Live Online&lt;/a&gt; format which has the added bonus of being taught &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt;, in this case by the course author himself, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/profiles/moses-frost/&quot;&gt;Moses Frost&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/&quot;&gt;SANS courses&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; good and I can‚Äôt express enough how impressed I always am with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/profiles/instructors/&quot;&gt;instructors&lt;/a&gt;. They‚Äôre of course knowledgeable about the subjects they teach, but moreso they always come prepared with a world of experience and anecdotes about their relevant time as a practictioner in the domain at hand. What you come away with in the end is not only a better grasp on the material, but also a sense of the real world applications of what you just learned. Things seem &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;, in a way that other eLearning formats fail to capture, as you don‚Äôt get the direct ‚Äúface-to-face‚Äù interaction with an educator of a similar caliber. &lt;em&gt;But enough waxing poetic about the instructors&lt;/em&gt;, let me tell you why I liked the content a bit more than last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/profiles/moses-frost/&quot;&gt;Moses&lt;/a&gt; admits that this course is stretched a bit thin, as in an ideal world, full 5-6 day courses could easily be constructed for many of the sub-topics contained within this course - &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/&quot;&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/a&gt;, etc‚Ä¶ At the time of writing this (re)review I don‚Äôt have my old books, so I can‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; compare the deltas between the original version of the course and the latest version, but based on my recollection I feel the recon section (&lt;em&gt;Day 1&lt;/em&gt;) has been modified to better relate to cloud-native-specific applications, a greater focus on attacking IAM is made on Day 2, the overall scope of the class is narrowed to just AWS and Azure (with a better balance between the two) and there were certainly tweaks elsewhere. Between the labs (which I actually took the time to do in this format), the moderately more focused content and the added expertise you get with the Live format, I think I can now safely &lt;strong&gt;recommend&lt;/strong&gt; this course. It‚Äôs still merely an introduction at the end of the day, but I truly feel you come away with a practical set of skills and the information and hunger needed to pursue further learning in the space. Speaking of further learning, I also know that a more advanced version of their cloud pentesting curriculum is on the horizon. Stay tuned for the &lt;em&gt;epic&lt;/em&gt; sequel, &lt;strong&gt;SEC688&lt;/strong&gt; - I‚Äôve heard it will not be one to miss!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec537-practical-osint-analysis-and-automation-sans&quot;&gt;SEC537: Practical OSINT Analysis and Automation, SANS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: July 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org&quot;&gt;SANS&lt;/a&gt; has recently stepped up, adding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/mlp/new-sans-courses/&quot;&gt;huge number of new courses&lt;/a&gt;, many of which are 2-day courses. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/practical-osint-analysis-and-automation/&quot;&gt;SEC537: Practical Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Analysis and Automation&lt;/a&gt; is one of these 2-day-ers. This shorter format, when executed well, can provide SANS‚Äô famed, high-density educational material &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the usual &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.teamascend.com/drinking-from-the-sans-fire-hose&quot;&gt;mental burnout&lt;/a&gt; which accompanies a typical 5-6 day, 8+ hours a day SANS course. Many will also benefit from not having to taken an entire week off of work to attend. A shorter class suffers though when material goes off track. With so little time you quickly lose value as there is but two days to cram all the relevant material into the class. I think SEC537 is an &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; course and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/profiles/david-mashburn/&quot;&gt;David Mashburn&lt;/a&gt; (who is one of the course authors) did a fantastic job both putting this course together as well as teaching, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; it does suffer from this latter point. But enough about that, let‚Äôs get into the material‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1 drops you immediately into a really cool discussion on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security&quot;&gt;OPSEC&lt;/a&gt;, covering everything from how to perform overt/covert/clandestine work to understanding exactly how your tools work - specifically, knowing what traffic they generate and where that traffic is destined. I would take an entire 6-day course on OPSEC if I could. The day wraps up with a section on image/video verification which I knew little about prior to the class but can definitely understand it‚Äôs OSINT-value now. Day 2 is where I think this class should be tweaked. This day begins with OSINT-relevant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; skilling but then unfortunately nose-dives into a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; basic ‚Äúintro-to-Python‚Äù lecture. For anyone who knows even basic Python, this section may disappoint. I recommend the intro Python material be moved to an appendix and be something the students learn if necessary as part of an after-hours bootcamp on Day 1. After half the day is spent learning basic Python, the class ends strongly with sections on interacting with the web programmatically (&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt; module) and performing Data Analysis with Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not counting the intro-to-Python chunk, I think this course was one of the more interesting SANS courses I‚Äôve taken (&lt;em&gt;pound for pound, if you will&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;Quick Note:&lt;/strong&gt; 2-day courses aren‚Äôt accompanied by a cert, so you really need only focus on learning the material. With everything said, this course being a SANS course means one inevitable thing - &lt;em&gt;a high price tag&lt;/em&gt;. At &lt;strong&gt;$2900&lt;/strong&gt; for just &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; days, &lt;em&gt;pricey&lt;/em&gt; is but one word to describe the course. I was fortunate to have taken this class via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/work-study-program/&quot;&gt;SANS Workstudy&lt;/a&gt;, so my wallet was not subjected to the full-wrath of SANS pricing. Overall, I &lt;strong&gt;do recommend&lt;/strong&gt; this course for the material, you need only find a way to finance it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec460-enterprise-and-cloud--threat-and-vulnerability-assessment-geva-sans&quot;&gt;SEC460: Enterprise and Cloud | Threat and Vulnerability Assessment (GEVA), SANS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: July 2021, GEVA Obtained: August 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/enterprise-cloud-threat-vulnerability-assessment/&quot;&gt;SEC460&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Enterprise and Cloud | Threat and Vulnerability Management&lt;/em&gt;) is the newest edition (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/press/announcements/sans-introduces-new-vulnerability-assessment-security-training-course/&quot;&gt;introduced in mid-2018&lt;/a&gt;) to the lineage of SANS &lt;em&gt;X60&lt;/em&gt; courses (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/network-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking/&quot;&gt;SEC560&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-penetration-testing-exploits-ethical-hacking/&quot;&gt;SEC660&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-exploit-development-penetration-testers/&quot;&gt;SEC760&lt;/a&gt;), all of which are part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/webcasts/introducing-offensive-operations-117455/&quot;&gt;recently introduced&lt;/a&gt; SANS &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/offensive-operations/&quot;&gt;Offensive Operations&lt;/a&gt; curriculum. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/&quot;&gt;SANS&lt;/a&gt; course numbering is notoriously wacky but in this case, these four courses describe a pretty realistic progression from &lt;em&gt;VM-to-pentester-to-exploit-developer&lt;/em&gt; (there are of course many other viable development paths into a career in penetration testing / offensive security). SANS courses with a &lt;em&gt;4xx&lt;/em&gt; designation have traditionally been more elementary in nature and though I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/enterprise-cloud-threat-vulnerability-assessment/&quot;&gt;SEC460&lt;/a&gt; certainly has some introductory concepts, it is &lt;em&gt;far more&lt;/em&gt; than its course number lets on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this course first debuted, I certainly underestimated it - relegating it in my mind as some lowly Vulnerability Management (&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/symphonic-vulnerability-surface-mapping#a-primer-on-vulnerability-management&quot;&gt;VM&lt;/a&gt;) training that entry-level infosec professionals would take to learn how to run a vulnerability scanner. Despite this, my background in &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/vm-bootcamp#title&quot;&gt;VM&lt;/a&gt; coupled with my lust for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/blog/sans-pen-test-challenge-coin-sec460/&quot;&gt;shiny things&lt;/a&gt; made me want to take the course anyways. When I got the chance to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/work-study-program/&quot;&gt;moderate the course&lt;/a&gt; I could not pass it up. Once in the class, it quickly became evident (within the first few hours of Day 1) that I had vastly miscalculated the content and value of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SANS is known for its (&lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt;) high-value content as well as their world-class instructors. This is &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; true for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/enterprise-cloud-threat-vulnerability-assessment/&quot;&gt;SEC460&lt;/a&gt;. My instructor for the course (and one of the course co-authors) was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/profiles/matthew-toussain/&quot;&gt;Matt Toussain&lt;/a&gt;. Matt (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0sm0s1z&quot;&gt;@Osm0s1z&lt;/a&gt;) did a truly amazing job both as an instructor as well as on developing the course content. His experience, expertise and professional anecdotes really take the course experience to the next level (in my opinion). &lt;em&gt;Ok, now about the course&lt;/em&gt;‚Ä¶ Despite what I originally thought, the course covers not only typical &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/symphonic-vulnerability-surface-mapping#a-primer-on-vulnerability-management&quot;&gt;Vulnerability Management&lt;/a&gt; and network scanning concepts but also covers a variety of other relevant subjects including (&lt;em&gt;but not limited to&lt;/em&gt;) - &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1&quot;&gt;Powershell&lt;/a&gt;, Cyber Threat Intelligence (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisecurity.org/blog/what-is-cyber-threat-intelligence/&quot;&gt;CTI&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling&quot;&gt;threat modeling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recordedfuture.com/open-source-intelligence-definition/&quot;&gt;OSINT&lt;/a&gt;, web application discovery, general reconnaissance, cloud security, Risk Assessment Frameworks (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Risk_Assessment_Framework_(RAF)&quot;&gt;RAFs&lt;/a&gt;), wireless, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nettitude.com/us/penetration-testing/purple-teaming/&quot;&gt;purple teaming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory&quot;&gt;Windows AD&lt;/a&gt;. The epiphany comes when you realize that these aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbonus‚Äù items or filler material but rather integral knowledge areas for performing comprehensive, modern Threat &amp;amp; Vulnerability Management/Assessment. Building this course, the authors were faced with the difficult mission of adding a large volume of material in such a way that students were not fed merely surface-level information on important concepts while at the same time not laboring over topics at a depth beyond what is required. This course strikes that balance in a way that I have not seen with almost any other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/?msc=main-nav&quot;&gt;SANS course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been involved with Vulnerability Management (&lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/symphonic-vulnerability-surface-mapping#a-primer-on-vulnerability-management&quot;&gt;VM&lt;/a&gt;) and/or Threat and Vulnerability Assessment (T&amp;amp;VA) for almost my entire professional career and I think this course nails 95% of what I‚Äôve personally used to execute in a VM role while also introducing a variety of new things I honestly never knew or thought to use with respect to building/running a VM program. This course, despite its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/webcasts/introducing-offensive-operations-117455/&quot;&gt;age&lt;/a&gt;, is in my opinion one of the more mature &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/?msc=main-nav&quot;&gt;SANS courses&lt;/a&gt; available and one &lt;strong&gt;I highly would recommend&lt;/strong&gt; not only to those new to the field or interested in the offensive security path, but also to more experienced infosec professionals and those in other, non-offensive-security roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the GEVA&lt;/strong&gt;: The certification exam (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/certification/enterprise-vulnerability-assessor-geva&quot;&gt;GEVA&lt;/a&gt;) is not too dissimilar from other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/certifications/focus-areas&quot;&gt;GIAC exams&lt;/a&gt; - multiple choice and &lt;em&gt;very heavy&lt;/em&gt; on material which is sourced almost word-for-word from the course books. My only complaint about this course or the cert itself is the over-reliance on terminology that I think is not industry-standard but rather SANS-specific terminology. For example - ‚ÄúTarget Matrix‚Äù is a term used to describe the list of potential targets which comes as result of the &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; phase of the Vulnerability Management Framework (VAF). Though this term makes sense, it‚Äôs not a term I have seen used before and to my knowledge, not something that is used industry-wide. Unfortunately, this micro-naming of concepts is very important for passing the exam (even if it‚Äôs not overly important to remember as an actual practitioner). So, &lt;em&gt;tldr;&lt;/em&gt; is - make sure you pay attention to SANS terminology as you will be quizzed on it if you sit for the exam!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec450-blue-team-fundamentals-security-operations-and-analysis-gsoc-sans&quot;&gt;SEC450: Blue Team Fundamentals: Security Operations and Analysis (GSOC), SANS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: July 2021, GSOC Obtained: September 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SANS &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/blue-team-fundamentals-security-operations-analysis/&quot;&gt;SEC450&lt;/a&gt; is a truly great course and one I would &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; recommend for all security pros on the ‚Äúblue‚Äù side of the house but one I also think would benefit anyone else in infosec as well. My instructor (and the course author) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/profiles/john-hubbard/&quot;&gt;John Hubbard&lt;/a&gt; does a fantastic job combining granular, practical exercises with high level, framework-based educational material. What you receive in the end is an amazingly succinct, yet potently high-value crash course on Security Operations. Day 1 introduces you to a number of high-level topics related to security operations in general. Days 2 and 3 have a lot of the technical meat - protocols, network architectures, endpoint security, logging, kerberos, etc‚Ä¶ Day 4 introduces you to a wealth of security related models (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html&quot;&gt;Cyber Kill Chain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework&quot;&gt;CSF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threatintel.academy/diamond/&quot;&gt;Diamond Model&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/f3ead-opsintel-fusion-‚Äúfeeds‚Äù-the-sof-targeting-process&quot;&gt;F3EAD&lt;/a&gt;, etc‚Ä¶) and finally, the entirety of Day 5 is focused on improving as a security professional, something that I think would be a great addendum to every single &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org&quot;&gt;SANS&lt;/a&gt; course as this section is really subject-agnostic and provides a lot of really high-value content. I think the real value of this course lies in Days 1, 4 and 5. These days gave me a better sense of how interconnected frameworks interlace with the high level concept of ‚Äúoperations‚Äù in security. I think many who look at this course may see it as an entry level course for traditional ‚ÄúSOC Analysts‚Äù. After sitting through it however, I think it is so much more. If you want to learn how to apply security best principles in an operational environment, regardless of your role, this is the course to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt have much to say on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/certification/security-operations-certified-gsoc&quot;&gt;GSOC&lt;/a&gt; exam itself other than to say its contents very closely resemble what you find both in the books as well as in the practice exam. The one thing I will say is there seemed to be an inordinate amount of questions about Windows logging despite how small of a section that is overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently challenged the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/certifications/open-source-intelligence-gosi/&quot;&gt;GIAC GOSI&lt;/a&gt; exam (which is the associated certification for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/open-source-intelligence-gathering/&quot;&gt;SANS SEC487&lt;/a&gt; course). As I didn‚Äôt take the full course, I can‚Äôt directly comment on how good or bad it is. What I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; comment on is my exam experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the course appears to be incredibly comprehensive, stepping through just about every &lt;a href=&quot;https://usnwc.libguides.com/c.php?g=494120&amp;amp;p=3381426&quot;&gt;flavor of OSINT&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. HUMINT, SIGINT, IMINT, MASINT, FININT, SOCMINT, etc‚Ä¶). If you‚Äôre looking for tools, well they got tools - TONS of them! You‚Äôre going to want to be ready to bookmark a load of (&lt;em&gt;naturally&lt;/em&gt;, open-source) tools. Unlike the wider universe of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/?msc=main-nav&quot;&gt;SANS courses&lt;/a&gt;, I found this one to have minimal overlap subject-wise with the &lt;a href=&quot;#certification-and-training-mini-reviews&quot;&gt;many other courses I have taken&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;This is a good thing&lt;/em&gt;! No matter your experience with OSINT, I think you can &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; walk away with some new tricks, new &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/infosec-tools#osint--reconnaissance&quot;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; and a boost to your practical skillset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exam experience is fairly straight-forward, as most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/how-to-prepare/&quot;&gt;GIAC exams&lt;/a&gt; are. My criticism of this test (like many other GIAC tests) is it doesn‚Äôt really test you on your practical skills/technical know-how, but rather tests whether you have memorized stuff from the books. There are a lot of questions like, ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;what tool is depicted in this picture&lt;/em&gt;?‚Äù or ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;what tool would you use for X purpose&lt;/em&gt;?‚Äù, then citing some niche website run by some researcher you might of only heard of had you taken the course and had the books on-hand. In the end, I do think this can be a valuable course for those who are interested in this type of work, but be weary of an attempt to challenge the exam!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec522-application-security-securing-web-apps-apis-and-microservices-gweb-sans&quot;&gt;SEC522: Application Security: Securing Web Apps, APIs, and Microservices (GWEB), SANS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GWEB Obtained: November 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been an AppSec professional in some form or fashion for nearly 10 years, and in that time I like to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I‚Äôve learned a thing or two not only about how to attack and compromise a web app, but also the ways in which to defend against those attacks and better harden said applications. To test this theory, I challenged the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/certifications/certified-web-application-defender-gweb/&quot;&gt;GIAC GWEB&lt;/a&gt; certification (associated with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/certifications/certified-web-application-defender-gweb/&quot;&gt;SANS SEC522&lt;/a&gt; course.) As I mentioned in my recent &lt;a href=&quot;#sec487-open-source-intelligence-osint-gathering-and-analysis-gosi-sans&quot;&gt;GOSI review&lt;/a&gt;, challenging a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/get-certified/&quot;&gt;SANS/GIAC exam&lt;/a&gt; is not for the faint of heart, as in many cases, the questions are sourced directly from the book material, and in these cases are often overly specific, relying on having memorized what was printed over having real practical experience/knowledge. For this reason, the exams can be somewhat artificially difficult (&lt;em&gt;when bookless&lt;/em&gt;). I‚Äôm pleased to say however, that my experience with the GWEB ran contrary to that trend. Questions &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; much more practical in nature, often worded in a scenario-like form rather than a simple memorization exercise. At times, questions delved &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; surface-level understanding, but overall, this exam (and presumably the course as well) remains a mile wide and an inch deep (so to speak), covering everything from HTTP basics, to common attack defenses, AuthN/AuthZ, web services and beyond. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org&quot;&gt;SANS&lt;/a&gt; is known pretty well for their great portfolio of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/offensive-operations/&quot;&gt;offensive security courses&lt;/a&gt;, and for good reason! However, this course‚Äôs dedication and focus on &lt;strong&gt;defense&lt;/strong&gt; and architectural best practices makes it somewhat unique and in my mind, &lt;em&gt;quite special&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mgt512-security-leadership-essentials-for-managers-gslc-sans&quot;&gt;MGT512: Security Leadership Essentials for Managers (GSLC), SANS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: August 2022, GSLC Obtained: December 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/security-leadership-essentials-managers/&quot;&gt;MGT512&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org&quot;&gt;SANS&lt;/a&gt;‚Äô flagship &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cybersecurity-leadership/&quot;&gt;management course&lt;/a&gt; and I‚Äôll start by giving the course a ~&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; for staying high-level and ‚Äúmanagerial‚Äù. There are certainly a few sections (&lt;em&gt;looking at you Days 2 &amp;amp; 3&lt;/em&gt;) where things get a bit overly technical for what I would expect in a course for managers. Then again, wouldn‚Äôt it be something to have leaders who had a certain level of technical proficiency? For the course itself, be prepared to think &lt;em&gt;CISO&lt;/em&gt;, as the typical SANS course week-end CTF is replaced by a &lt;em&gt;week-long&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/blog/introducing-the-mgt512-cyber42-security-leadership-simulation/&quot;&gt;choose-your-own-adventure style game&lt;/a&gt; where you act as a security leader making decisions for a fictional company. Maintain a practical, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework&quot;&gt;NIST CSF&lt;/a&gt;-balanced approach to achieve victory, and of course, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/captains-log&quot;&gt;challenge coin&lt;/a&gt;! When you‚Äôre not bogged down learning about low-level encryption stuff (or similar technical minutiae), you‚Äôre back to big-picture items - learning about the frameworks, policies, program structures and other risk-governed concepts that rule the lives of security leaders everywhere. &lt;em&gt;So is this a good course&lt;/em&gt;? Hard to say. I personally, didn‚Äôt get &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; out of it, but I‚Äôve been in infosec for 12+ years as of writing this mini-review and have spent plenty of time across nearly all infosec disciplines. For managers looking to make sense of it all though, I suspect this would be quality content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those interested in taking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giac.org/certifications/security-leadership-gslc/&quot;&gt;GSLC&lt;/a&gt; exam, it is very reminiscent of other content-broad exams (e.g. Sec+, CISSP, GSEC, etc‚Ä¶). With a fair amount of scenario-based questions (rather than pure memorization questions GIAC exams are known for), there is certainly some challenge and you should be relatively versed in the days material to achieve a high score. That said, with 3 hours to answer 115 questions, you have ample time to leverage the books in case you need to look up some answers or find references to assist you with a tricky question or two (&lt;em&gt;or 50&lt;/em&gt;). Interestingly, I found this exam to be a bit more challenging than the usual GIAC exam, but with a passing score of only &lt;em&gt;65%&lt;/em&gt;, success is pretty easy to come by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt; My thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/profiles/myngoc-nguyen/&quot;&gt;My-Ngoc Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;, who kept the course days very lively and fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;windows-malware-and-memory-forensics-volatility&quot;&gt;Windows Malware and Memory Forensics, Volatility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: October 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memoryanalysis.net/memory-forensics-training&quot;&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; at a point in time where I was seriously unprepared for it. For this reason, I can‚Äôt really give a recommendation on the course itself. However, I will say that before you consider taking this course, you are going to want to pay close attention to Volatility‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memoryanalysis.net/memory-forensics-training#prerequisites&quot;&gt;expected prerequisites&lt;/a&gt;. This class is not for the faint of heart and requires some serious pre-requisite knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to add here that though I didn‚Äôt learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility&quot;&gt;Volatility&lt;/a&gt; nearly as well as I had hoped during the course, having been severely underprepared for the course at the time I took it, I did have a lot of fun using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/strings&quot;&gt;strings&lt;/a&gt; to conquer WAY too many of the CTF questions on the final day. Don‚Äôt discount the power of Strings and GREP!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: July 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackhat.com/us-18/training/the-shellcode-lab.html&quot;&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; while at Blackhat one year and came away really impressed. It‚Äôs one of those courses that takes what seems to be a pretty advanced and relatively opaque subject and makes it very approachable. By the end of those course I felt I had acquired a lot of practical skills. I recommend anyone interested in this class to have some familiarity with &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/intel-assembly-primer#title&quot;&gt;Intel assembly&lt;/a&gt; but after that, I think its relatively approachable and &lt;strong&gt;definitely recommended&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: March 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redteamsecure.com/blog/what-is-red-teaming-and-why-do-i-need-it-2/&quot;&gt;Red Teaming&lt;/a&gt; is one of the apex disciplines of the Cybersecurity field. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/&quot;&gt;SANS&lt;/a&gt;, as one of the premier cyber security education providers in the world offers only a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/red-team-exercises-adversary-emulation/&quot;&gt;two-day course&lt;/a&gt; covering the subject. This speaks to the &lt;em&gt;niche-ness&lt;/em&gt; of Red Teaming as well as it‚Äôs advanced nature. This course, formerly taught and authored-by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joevest&quot;&gt;Joe Vest&lt;/a&gt; (the course author is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jorgeorchilles&quot;&gt;Jorge Orchilles&lt;/a&gt;, creator of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thec2matrix.com/&quot;&gt;C2Matrix&lt;/a&gt;) is one of the best, most-concise introductions to Red Teaming I have found and would be valuable for anyone who is looking to stand up a Red Team practice at their organization. Being a SANS course, the price is still steep, but at only two days and given the fact that &lt;em&gt;your organization should really be paying for you to take the course&lt;/em&gt;, I &lt;strong&gt;definitely recommend&lt;/strong&gt; it. It is important to note that this course is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; technical in nature. It certainly won‚Äôt get into the gritty technical aspects of red teaming, nor does it really explain with any sort of technical depth, the nature of standing up any sort of red team infrastructure. For this, I recommend taking a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;#specterops-adversary-tactics-red-team-operations&quot;&gt;SpecterOps Adversary Tactics: Red Team Operations&lt;/a&gt; training. With this said, I think performing successful red team engagements requires a thorough understanding of what red teaming really is, especially compared to traditional penetration testing, as well as an understanding of all the moving parts, players, stakeholders etc‚Ä¶ This course will help you achieve that understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sans-sec642-advanced-web-app-penetration-testing&quot;&gt;SANS SEC642 Advanced Web App Penetration Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: May 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SANS‚Äô top tier web-app specific penetration testing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/ondemand/course/advanced-web-app-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking&quot;&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; is a bit hit-and-miss in my opinion. The problem with any ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù course is that it‚Äôs really difficult, in any 6 day period (which is the length of your typically full SANS course) to cover even a small fraction of the known techniques applicable to any specific penetration testing discipline, in this case web application penetration testing. Given everything that could be covered, SANS authors decided on SQLi, XSS, File Inclusions, XSRF, attacks specific to some web frameworks, crypto attacks, some WAF bypass stuff, and a little bit on Flash, SOAP, WebSockets and HTTP/2. This list obviously misses a gigantic swath of the web attack surface and even within this list itself these concepts are only barely touched. By far the most interesting day (for me) was the day on crypto-attacks but even that I‚Äôm skeptical as to the real practicality of what I learned. I‚Äôm not saying I didn‚Äôt learn anything useful in 6 days, but I think anyone at the stage in their career where they are interested in ‚Äúadvanced web application penetration testing‚Äù is better off with other educational mediums. You could probably learn more in 6 days just &lt;a href=&quot;https://pentester.land/list-of-bug-bounty-writeups.html&quot;&gt;reading bug bounty writeups&lt;/a&gt; for example! An added negative is that this course currently does not offer a certification, so at the end of the day, you‚Äôre really only taking this course for its content - and at $7k+, I think &lt;strong&gt;you‚Äôre money is better spent elsewhere&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Looks like this course is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/captains-log/2022/08/27/log#what-im-learning&quot;&gt;officially deprecated&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;for now&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;RIP&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;specterops-adversary-tactics-red-team-operations&quot;&gt;SpecterOps Adversary Tactics: Red Team Operations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: June 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://specterops.io/&quot;&gt;SpecterOps&lt;/a&gt; is a (primarily offensive) security consulting company specializing in (bleeding-edge) research, assessments and training. Prior to taking their &lt;a href=&quot;https://specterops.io/how-we-help/training-offerings/adversary-tactics-red-team-operations&quot;&gt;Red Team Operations course&lt;/a&gt;, I was familiar with them as the creators of both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.powershellempire.com/?page_id=83&quot;&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot;&gt;BloodHound&lt;/a&gt;. For a four day course on what is a very advanced, and very broad subject - I think the Red Team Operations course is outstanding. It covers both managerial and technical aspects of Red Teaming, everything from initial access operations (IAO) and establishing C2 to persistence, privesc and pivoting, all while in a modern, Windows-based AD environment. Within the labs you‚Äôll get real, practical experience with the tools of the trade (e.g. Cobalt Strike) and modern techniques. With this said, I don‚Äôt think this course alone can take someone who isn‚Äôt already a red teamer and make them one over the course of four days. Even as deep as this course gets, the nature of Red Teaming is one that requires breadth and depth far beyond what this course can offer. For this reason, &lt;strong&gt;I recommend&lt;/strong&gt; this course for those who already possess a moderate to advanced penetration testing background or those with entry-level experience in red teaming. I‚Äôll also point out that this training is useful (as is most trainings) only if you have the ability to practice what you‚Äôve learned after-the-fact. Unlike a lot of other security disciplines, &lt;em&gt;adversary emulation&lt;/em&gt; is difficult to ‚Äúpractice‚Äù in a lab environment, you need both a legally-appropriate and willing test-subject. This means your best-off if you are already part of an internal red team or are looking to stand one up at your organization. Without this in place, I don‚Äôt recommend taking the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;offensive-security-advanced-windows-exploitation&quot;&gt;Offensive Security Advanced Windows Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attended: August 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/awe-osee/&quot;&gt;AWE&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/&quot;&gt;Offensive Security‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; most difficult and arguably most prestigious certification, focusing exclusively on advanced, modern, Windows exploit development. With an interest in vulnerability research and thus an interest in exploit development, coupled with &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; experience in exploit writing and reverse engineering I decided to sign up and make my way through the course. Offered only in-person at the yearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackhat.com/us-20/&quot;&gt;Black Hat&lt;/a&gt; security conference and with very limited seats available, I was lucky to have been given the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I will admit that at the time I sat for this course my exploit development skills and experience were certainly more on the beginner-side but based on my observations of other students in the class, I can say with no doubt, that this course is every bit as mind-melting and challenging as you might expect or have read in other reviews, even for those with far more experience than I. In hind-sight, I‚Äôm comfortable enough to say that I was out of my depth and would have been better served taking the course after I had a little more experience. But perhaps more importantly, I should have waited to take the course for when i was truly ready both mentally and professionally, to dive fully into the world of vulnerability research and exploit development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This takes me to my advice for those thinking about enrolling. If you aren‚Äôt already a vulnerability researcher, penetration tester, exploit developer or aren‚Äôt thinking about making the shift into that realm in the near-ish future, I probably would not sign up for the course. Without a good amount of preexisting experience or knowledge, theres a decent chance the material will fly over your head. But also, if you don‚Äôt plan on exercising what you‚Äôve learned in short order, your unlikely to retain a lot of the information, nor will you be able to properly study for and take the extremely challenging &lt;a href=&quot;https://theevilbit.blogspot.com/2015/09/offensive-security-advanced-windows.html&quot;&gt;OSEE&lt;/a&gt; certification. With all this said, I do think that for those that are mentally (and emotionally) prepared, this course could really help someone push themselves further into modern exploit development and vulnerability research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;jhu-masters-in-cybersecurity-review&quot;&gt;JHU Masters in Cybersecurity Review&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in mid-2016 and finishing up almost exactly 4 years later in 2020, I &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; completed my Masters degree at Johns Hopkins University, achieving an MS in Cybersecurity. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/programs-and-courses/programs/cybersecurity&quot;&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; proved both challenging and rewarding as well as at times disappointing and even quite useless. I want to say early on in this review that I don‚Äôt recommend people sign up and self-pay for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; Cybersecurity masters degree. I don‚Äôt think in the infosec industry, there is any significant professional value with having a masters, outside of maybe qualifying for some manager roles. This is especially true given the time and money you must invest to even get a masters degree. They are expensive and in most cases, it seems that having a certification or two will more than satisfy contractual, HR or hiring manager requirements. In my case, my company was willing to foot the bill for the program and seeing the opportunity, I decided why not!? I of course fully recommend taking advantage of free, employer-sponsored training wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did I decide on the JHU program? Since I would still be working full time I needed to limit my choices to online programs only. Preferably as well, I wanted to choose an institution that was close by in the event that I needed to go on-campus for some reason, either to speak with a professor, collaborate with fellow students or take a class only offered on-premise. Living in the northern Virginia/DC metro area this still left me with a good number of options. With these requirements in mind I considered the following programs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.umgc.edu/academic-programs/cyber-security/index.cfm&quot;&gt;University of Maryland University College (UMUC)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mage.umd.edu/cybersecurity&quot;&gt;University of Maryland (UMD)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/programs/cybersecurity/&quot;&gt;Johns Hopkins University (JHU)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sans.edu/academics/degrees/msise&quot;&gt;SANS Technology Institute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://volgenau.gmu.edu/expertise/cybersecurity&quot;&gt;George Mason University&lt;/a&gt;. I won‚Äôt get into all the small decisions that ultimately led to me choosing the JHU program but in general I chose it for three reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, and most importantly, I liked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/programs/cybersecurity/courses/&quot;&gt;available courses&lt;/a&gt; more so than any other program. Namely, I was interested in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/reverse-engineering-and-vulnerability-analysis/&quot;&gt;reverse engineering course&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/software-development-for-real-time-embedded-systems/&quot;&gt;embedded systems course&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/cyber-physical/&quot;&gt;cyber physical systems course&lt;/a&gt;. My primary focus with this degree was to focus on the learning aspects rather than just the idea of having a masters degree for my resume.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second, after some research, it looked like the JHU program was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bestcolleges.com/features/top-online-masters-in-cybersecurity-programs/&quot;&gt;rated very high if not the highest among online Cybersecurity masters programs&lt;/a&gt;. I took this as a sign that this would be the best bet in terms of getting a high-quality, masters-level Cybersecurity education.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Third, I felt that Johns Hopkins had a particular prestige, especially in my area, and that having a degree from there would look good on my resume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how were the Masters classes? Well first, prior to getting accepted ‚Äúofficially‚Äù into the Masters program I needed to take a few additional pre-requisite courses. This included a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/intro-to-programming-using-java/&quot;&gt;Java class&lt;/a&gt;, a course in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/data-structures/&quot;&gt;Data Structures&lt;/a&gt; and a course in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/computer-organization/&quot;&gt;‚ÄúComputer Organization‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/discrete-mathematics/&quot;&gt;Discrete Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/introduction-to-python/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; are also required pre-reqs but I had already satisfied these through undergraduate and professional work). All three of these courses were great additions to what was my overall masters curriculum and interestingly enough, three of my favorite courses I took over the course of getting the degree, despite none of them actually be masters courses (they were bachelor-level courses). The Java course is self explanatory, it was simply a beginner-to-intermediate-level course in Java programming. The Data Structures course I found fascinating and pretty invaluable. To this day I still use the concepts I learned in this class for both my personal/professional development efforts as well as for understanding concepts related to modern operating systems, memory, reverse engineering, etc‚Ä¶ The Computer Organization course was primarily centered around assembly programming. This has proven to be very useful foundational knowledge for my forays into reverse engineering, exploit development and general security research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I finished the necessary pre-reqs I was formally accepted into the Masters program and now needed to complete the 10 Masters courses. Three of these are mandatory courses - &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/foundations-of-algorithms/&quot;&gt;Foundations of Algorithms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/foundations-of-information-assurance/&quot;&gt;Foundations of Information Assurance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/cryptology/&quot;&gt;Cryptology&lt;/a&gt;. Foundations of Algorithms is advertised as the sequel to Data Structures and maybe in theory it is, but I found the class (and I can not stress this enough) completely useless, entirely opaque, and overtly difficult. In fact, the professor even suggested, during an office hours one night, that the class did not make sense for anyone who wasn‚Äôt in applied mathematics or certain (more abstract) disciplines of computer science. The course content, assignments and projects were all nearly impossible to follow, to the point where the professor would essentially just give us the answers since he knew how difficult the material was. Overall this class was a complete dud, in all respects. It was a waste of my time and I learned absolutely nothing. Unfortunately, it was required and therefore I could not get out of it, nor can anyone else in this program. Moving on‚Ä¶ The ‚ÄúFoundations of Information Assurance‚Äù course was your typical ‚Äúintro to information security‚Äù type stuff. Given my experience in the field, I did not personally get much value out of this course. Now if you had less experience in the field or are coming into this Masters program fresh out of your undergrad or early enough in your Cybersecurity career, I can definitely see how this class would prove beneficial to building your understanding of the fundamentals of infosec. So again, kind of a dud for me. The third and final mandatory class was in Cryptology. This class, unlike the first two, I found challenging, interesting, relevant and worthy of the Cybersecurity masters class designation. This was a highly technical class where you really are taught how modern ciphers work, the mathematical principles that are the groundwork of these cryptological constructs and are even taught cryptoanalytic techniques. My word of warning for those who are getting ready for this course is to take it seriously, not only because it is challenging but because it is information dense and it is knowledge you really are going to want to try and commit to memory as best you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the three required classes, I needed to choose seven electives from their &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/programs/cybersecurity/courses/&quot;&gt;catalog of courses&lt;/a&gt;. The seven I chose are listed below (in the order I took them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;elective-classes&quot;&gt;Elective Classes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#principles-of-data-communications&quot;&gt;Principles of Data Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#embedded-computer-systems&quot;&gt;Embedded Computer Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#software-development-for-real-time-embedded-systems&quot;&gt;Software Development for Real-Time Embedded Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#reverse-engineering-and-vulnerability-analysis&quot;&gt;Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#operating-systems&quot;&gt;Operating Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#web-security&quot;&gt;Web Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#intrusion-detection&quot;&gt;Intrusion Detection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd like to quickly review and give my thoughts on each of these below‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;principles-of-data-communications&quot;&gt;Principles of Data Communications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary things I hoped to get out of experience with this Masters program was to get a deeper, more robust understanding of TCP/IP and computer networking. I wanted to understand these concepts from a purely academic perspective, rather than an applied one as I had received via an assortment of training courses (such as the &lt;a href=&quot;#sec503-intrusion-detection-in-depth-gcia-sans&quot;&gt;SANS course SEC503&lt;/a&gt;). JHU offers a variety of courses related to this domain, all of which required this course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/principles-of-data-communications-networks/&quot;&gt;Principles of Data Communications&lt;/a&gt;, to be taken as a pre-req. This course primarily covers the Layer 1 (physical layer) aspects of network communications focusing on topics such as digital vs analog encoding, multiplexing, signaling, error-detection, data compression and more advanced topics. Though I found this course very interesting, I think it was a little TOO low level for what I was looking for. I would need to take a different class to cover networking concepts related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model&quot;&gt;layers&lt;/a&gt; 2-4 which was after all, my primary interest in taking this class in the first place. Ultimately, I only recommend this course for those who really want to know these low level mechanics. Then again, this course is also a pre-req for almost all other courses in the networking track for this degree program so you may have to take it regardless if you have your eyes set on something which requires it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, out of the 6 other electives I chose from here, none of them actually ended up being one of the classes that would focus more on networking or TCP/IP! Oh well, sometimes even the best-laid plans go awry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;embedded-computer-systems&quot;&gt;Embedded Computer Systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an interest in vulnerability research, especially in the realm of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things&quot;&gt;IoT&lt;/a&gt;, got me hooked on the idea of learning more about embedded systems. So much so that I decided to take not one but TWO electives on the subject, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/embedded-computer-systems-vulnerabilities-intrusions-and-protection-mechanisms/&quot;&gt;this class&lt;/a&gt; and a class on &lt;a href=&quot;#software-development-for-real-time-embedded-systems&quot;&gt;software development for embedded systems&lt;/a&gt;. This first class I felt was a real dud and was pretty much useless. The class was mostly a series of bizarre ‚Äúcase studies‚Äù that hardly had anything to really do with embedded systems. Not once did I get to dump firmware off of an embedded system or even physically do anything with an embedded system. There was nothing about the course which was even remotely practical, or interesting in any way. At certain points the course material would pivot into even softer subjects like ‚Äúcopywright law‚Äù or ‚Äúlicensing agreements‚Äù. This class ended up being a huge disappointment and I would &lt;strong&gt;not recommend&lt;/strong&gt; it to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;software-development-for-real-time-embedded-systems&quot;&gt;Software Development for Real-Time Embedded Systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second of &lt;a href=&quot;#embedded-computer-systems&quot;&gt;two embedded systems-related classes&lt;/a&gt; I took focused on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/software-development-for-real-time-embedded-systems/&quot;&gt;software development for embedded systems&lt;/a&gt;, more specifically, development on &lt;em&gt;real-time systems (RTOS)&lt;/em&gt;. This class was extremely practical as we spent the entire time actually writing code for arduino systems and even building a drone-system with a variety of sensors all interfacing with the arduino. I greatly enjoyed this class and felt like i learned quite a bit on the subject. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm not entirely sure how useful this knowledge has been (so far) with respect to my career. I‚Äôll also point out that the use of a drone for this class was highly suspect as the drone kit was not particularly easy to use and all lab deliverables required videos of the drone being successfully flown while also performing a number of other in-flight operations. This put those who were not particularly great drone pilots (like myself) at a bit of a disadvantage. I appreciate the spirit of what the professor was going for here but I think the class would have been better served with something a bit easier to control like an RC car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reverse-engineering-and-vulnerability-analysis&quot;&gt;Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/reverse-engineering-and-vulnerability-analysis/&quot;&gt;reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis&lt;/a&gt; was by far my favorite course and I believe, objectively-speaking, the best course I took throughout the course of my Masters program. This class is the perfect mix of both theory and practical exercises, set to an extremely fast pace. Within the first week you will have covered and began deciphering &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/intel-assembly-primer#title&quot;&gt;Intel assembly&lt;/a&gt; instructions as well as started writing your own Intel assembly disassembler! By the end of the class you will be doing full malware reverse engineering and even writing your own exploits from scratch. This class was no joke! I &lt;strong&gt;can‚Äôt recommend this class enough&lt;/strong&gt;, especially for those interested in these advanced topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operating-systems&quot;&gt;Operating Systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/operating-systems/&quot;&gt;This course&lt;/a&gt; was a bit of a mixed- bag. From a theory perspective, this course was exactly what I was looking for. It covered all the core operating system constructs (e.g. interrupts, kernel types, system calls, system architectures, system programming, scheduling, I/O, multi threading, memory, task management, deadlocks, device drivers, file systems and more!). Execution of the &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; side of this course was where the big let down was. Namely, the course author decided to have all assignments and labs (all of which were heavily focused on system programming) be based on the strange, little-heard-of, not-modern, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.minix3.org/&quot;&gt;Minix 3&lt;/a&gt; microkernel-based operating system. Now I had never heard of Minix 3 and asking my coworkers about Minix yielded a similar response. What was Minix 3 and why would my professor think this was a good platform to teach OS concepts? I mean, it doesnt even use a modern architecture, Minix 3 after all is a micro-kernel architecture as opposed to a more modern, monolithic or hybrid-based architecture. This course required a pretty firm understanding of C programming as well as some prior experience in Unix system programming, neither of which I really had. Picking up C was easy enough but learning to write code specifically for an operating system that no one uses and thus has little references online, proved to be a real struggle. I‚Äôll also add here that the professor was particularly non-helpful when it came to actually teaching these more practical concepts. Perhaps the expectation was that this was something I should have already known coming into the course. Either way, I found the system programming segments of the course to be frustrating and stressful as they were a very large part of my final grade. Ultimately I did prevail and though I have some pretty big issues with this particular aspect of the course, I do think overall I would continue to recommend it to those who want to learn more about operating systems. My recommendation to Johns Hopkins however is to use a more relevant, modern operating system (like actual Linux!) as the practical foundation for this class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;web-security&quot;&gt;Web Security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/web-security/&quot;&gt;This course&lt;/a&gt; was an interesting overview of the wide-variety of web-related technologies a security professional must consider, with topics including web-based crypto, writing RESTful APIs using Flask, AWS cloud, SAST/DASTWAF concepts, IoT protocols, container technologies such as Docker, open-source vulnerability scanners and finally a module on traditional web-application vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQLi etc‚Ä¶ I found this course to be a little meandering, never doing anything more than scraping the surface of each of these topics. Yes, there were some interesting practical exercises sprinkled throughout but mostly I found that getting a ‚Äútaste‚Äù of so many things was not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; valuable (to me personally). I‚Äôll qualify this by saying at this point in time I had several years of web application security and cloud experience so some of this material may have simply just not been that new to me and thus I found the lectures and assignments a bit boring. For someone interested in getting a look on everything ‚Äúgoin on‚Äù in the web security world, I think this course can satisfy that specific need. Outside of that, I think most people might leave this class just hungry for something a little more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intrusion-detection&quot;&gt;Intrusion Detection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My seventh and final elective was &lt;a href=&quot;https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/intrusion-detection/&quot;&gt;Intrusion Detection&lt;/a&gt;. I had not intended to take this course and only did end up enrolling due to availability and scheduling issues related to another class I had planned on taking. It was my final semester however and at this point I really wanted to close the book on this program and move on to other things in my life! It turns out that I‚Äôm happy I took the course as it was (similar to my &lt;a href=&quot;#reverse-engineering-vulnerability-analysis&quot;&gt;Reverse Engineering course&lt;/a&gt;) a really satisfying mix of both theory and practical exercises. Notably, I‚Äôd like to call out the excellent labs (assigned weekly) which covered a wide variety of tools (some of which I did have prior experience with) such as Nmap, Linux, TripWire, OSSEC, Snort, Neo4j, Cypher, Zeek, iptables, ROC analysis, Keras and RapidMiner. I definitely recommend this class for anyone looking to get some good experience with any one of these tools and learn more about general intrusion detection in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-wish-i-had-done-differently&quot;&gt;What I wish I had done differently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having finally graduated, I wanted to take a look back at my experience both with JHU at a high level and with each of my classes and reflect on what I may have done differently. First I want to say that if I could go back in time, I would stilll choose the JHU program over any of the other schools I had considered. What I would change however is some of the classes I took. I‚Äôve made it clear in my reviews above what classes I thought were good, which had value specifically to me and which classes I thought were awful. Out of the 10 masters-level classes I took, three of them I found both well done and applicable/valuable to my career, three of them I found very interesting and well done yet not particularly relevant to my career, two of them I found a little too ‚Äúhigh level‚Äù and not particularly useful and another two I thought were just atrocious. Looking at these numbers it‚Äôd be easy to come to the determination (with only 3 classes I actually thought were useful to me) that I didn‚Äôt get out of this program what I had hoped.  Had I chose different classes I certainly would have gotten more out of the program but I am thankful for what I was able to learn. Some classes I would have liked to try instead include offerings on Java Security, Cyber Physical Systems Security, Operating Systems Security and even Digital Forensics. I‚Äôll add that there seems to have been some significant changes to the course catalog since I graduated (which was only a few weeks ago as of this writing) with more courses having been added, notably classes on DevOps and ‚ÄúAssured Autonomy‚Äù, both of which might have been interesting to me and would certainly be worth checking out for anyone considering this program. After taking the class in &lt;a href=&quot;#reverse-engineering-and-vulnerability-analysis&quot;&gt;reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis&lt;/a&gt;, the professor suggested, for anyone who was interested, doing an &lt;a href=&quot;https://advising.jhu.edu/research-internships-and-independent-study/&quot;&gt;Independent Study&lt;/a&gt; in place of a typical elective. This would offer the same three credits but allow for a more exploratory, research-oriented approach to the reverse engineering material (or any other class you would be interested in). I seriously considered doing this for reverse engineering but ultimately decided not to. I regret this decision and recommend those who are taking this program to not be lazy and do what you think sounds interesting, even if it will be more work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;retrospective&quot;&gt;Retrospective&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs really incredible and I‚Äôm extremely grateful for all the opportunities I‚Äôve been given over the last 5 years and though there are plenty of things I would change if I could go back and somehow make adjustments along the way, I am ultimately very satisfied with how everything has turned out and the choices I made. In closing, I have just a few parting nuggets of ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù / advice I‚Äôd like to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make an effort to continually &lt;em&gt;re-focus&lt;/em&gt;, frequently ask yourself what you want to do or where you‚Äôd like to be and make constant adjustments to better reach that goal. It‚Äôs easy to be swept into something or fall into a ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù such that you drift away from where you really want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Appreciate all opportunities and try not to discount the things you may learn that you think are not relevant or useful. Too many times have I had the chance to learn something I didn‚Äôt think was useful so I never really committed myself to it, only to later realize i DID want to know it and was then force to teach myself again. You‚Äôll save yourself plenty of time and headache by just having an open mind and being as much of a willing knowledge-sponge as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revel in the fact that infosec is such a cool and exciting field! One that for those who are motivated enough, can be a place of rapid development and overwhelming opportunity. Take advantage of the vast network of people just like yourself who are looking to share their experiences, network and continuously learn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for reading, whether it was the entirety of this article (I know it‚Äôs quite long) or any given section. I hope some of it was enlightening or valuable and if there are any questions or you‚Äôd like to know more / share your own experiences I‚Äôd love to hear about it! &lt;a href=&quot;https://shellsharks.com/contact&quot;&gt;Feel free to reach out&lt;/a&gt; anytime!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I always begin in darkness, surrounded by glowing white pinpricks of light; these are distant beacons of worlds unknown.
