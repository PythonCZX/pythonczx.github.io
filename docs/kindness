their blog</a>. I did too. But it turns out, not only did people find and read what I had to say, but they were nice enough to tell me they liked it too. This post is all about that. <strong>Kindness</strong>. I‚Äôm very appreciative of everyone who has taken the time to reach out and let me know they liked something they saw on my site. Thank you! üß°<p>Below is just a log of nice things people have reached out to me and said. Some days, when I don‚Äôt feel like writing, or I‚Äôm just bummed about the world, maybe I can come here and remember everyone who I‚Äôve helped in some small way and use it as motivation.<p>If there‚Äôs something, or someone you appreicate out there, just send ‚Äòem a message! I‚Äôm sure it will mean a lot to them.<hr width="66%" /><p>From Arjun (<em>4/4/25</em>)<blockquote><p>I just wanted to reach out and say a big thank you. Your work on Shellsharks and especially your article on <a href="/you-should-blog">why people should blog</a>. It pushed me to finally start my own blog‚Äîeven though it‚Äôs super basic right now and nowhere near as cool as Shellsharks!<p>I‚Äôve built this space to share my work, explore interesting cyber threats, and document my learnings. My goal over the next few months is to stay consistent, keep improving the site, and use it as a platform to grow and contribute to the community.<p>It‚Äôs been a great learning experience so far, and I owe a lot of that inspiration to you‚Ä¶<p>Thanks again for doing what you do‚Äîit genuinely sparked something for me.</blockquote><p>From Franklin (<em>3/27/25</em>)<blockquote><p>Wanted to write a quick note and say thank you for the time, effort, and thoughtfulness you put into the <a href="/vm-bootcamp">Vulnerability Management Bootcamp</a>.<p>I‚Äôve been trying to break into the security space for a few years now. I worked my way up from a desktop support intern to a senior analyst and earned a few certifications along the way‚Äîbut I never quite had the opportunity to pivot into a full-time security role. At times, I honestly questioned whether the field was just too saturated or if IT folks simply weren‚Äôt being given a shot in CyberSec.<p>Then I came across your course. I took my time and went through it thoroughly in preparation for a Security Analyst interview with a Vulnerability Management team. The bootcamp gave me so much confidence heading into the interview and it also gave me so many things to talk about. Long story short, I was able to impress the panel and I just received a job offer today ‚Äì my first CyberSec role. I look forward to checking your content more and more.</blockquote><p>From Nakul (<em>3/14/25</em>)<blockquote><p>I came across your blog (Shellsharks) while I was browsing the web for cybersec resources I found it quite insightful.</blockquote><p>From Kai (<em>3/7/25</em>)<blockquote><p>also, your website is flipping awesome. Subscribed!<p>Also, I might be stealing some ideas for my own site eventually üôà</blockquote><p>From Tyler (<em>3/5/25</em>)<blockquote><p>I‚Äôm Tyler, an infosec enthusiast working toward a career in the field. I came across your blog a month or so ago while researching inspiration for my own portfolio and blog. I loved the site theme and found your content incredibly interesting and engaging.</blockquote><p>On (<em>3/5/25</em>)<blockquote><p>For real, give @shellsharks@shellsharks.social a follow. Always good stuff.</blockquote><p>From Himanshu (<em>3/4/25</em>)<blockquote><p>‚Ä¶Great work and I appreciate the work and the amount of effort you have taken to make one‚Ä¶</blockquote><p>From Zak (<em>3/3/25</em>)<blockquote><p>Your website is absolute killer. You‚Äôve got the absolute knack for linking resources to relevant things, whilst keeping the momentum of the message you‚Äôre writing. I usually have CTRL held down as I read and click as I go. I always prepare myself for some rabbit-hole when your posts appear in my RSS feed. Your hyper(space)link travel post is an inspiration. I love a well-linked site so hopefully some others pick up the nudge too. I am meaning to do a similar post in the near future.</blockquote><p>From Phillip (<em>2/28/25</em>)<blockquote><p>love your scrolls newsletter üòç . Always so much to discover.</blockquote><p>From Moahmed (<em>2/24/25</em>)<blockquote><p>I just want to say your indie blog website, https://shellsharks.com, has been a big inspiration for me and has helped me gain a huge amount of insight. It inspired me so much, I actually made my own indie blog website.</blockquote><p>From Jeffrey (<em>2/24/25</em>)<blockquote><p>And your website is really cool, which must indicate that its owner is also really cool! I will add it to my indieroll ^_^</blockquote><p>From John (<em>2/20/25</em>)<blockquote><p>I love <a href="/devlog/shark-fin-hr">this</a>! Such a neat touch of personality.<p>Bravo, Poseidon or Aquaman or somethin‚Äô.</blockquote><p>From John (<em>2/18/25</em>)<blockquote><p>as an aside, I continue to be enamoured with your site. Its such a clean design and layout, with a focus on text readability, along with having a fantastic wealth of information on it.<p>I also love that it‚Äôs a static-generated site and not $blog_platform. I‚Äôve tried so many times to investigate static site generators, but could never close the gap between ease of use and ease of use and aesthetic.</blockquote><p>From Ishmael M. (<em>2/18/25</em>)<blockquote><p>Hi Michael! I‚Äôve been reading your Shellsharks blog posts and there are some great gems in there. It‚Äôs been great reading them.</blockquote><p>From Hedy (<em>2/18/25</em>)<blockquote><p>I love the design of your site, and even moreso the thorough overview of its architecture. You‚Äôve been added to the webring, welcome!</blockquote><p>From Arjun T. (<em>2/18/25</em>)<blockquote><p>Hello Michael, It feels honoured to be connected. I have no questions or the need to ask for advice from you. Just wanted to tell you, I am a huge fan of shellsharks. A huge fan. I have been checking out the site for a long time and only today I visited to about page and found you. From a reddit comment. I went ‚ÄúAHHH NO WAYYY! IT IS HIMM‚Äù Love your work. Keep doing it. Keep inspiring us.</blockquote><p>From Bob (<em>2/13/25</em>)<blockquote><p>I love it! I like how you‚Äôve ‚Äúsurfaced‚Äù recent posts, notes, etc. The old design is also great, but I think you‚Äôve taken it up a notch or two with this one. Nice work!</blockquote><p>From Eliezer G. (<em>1/3/25</em>)<blockquote><p>Here from shellsharks amazing stuff !</blockquote><p>From AK H. (<em>11/10/24</em>)<blockquote><p>My name is A.K., and I currently work as a systems administrator for the University of Maryland‚Äôs helpdesk, a position I‚Äôve held for several years.
