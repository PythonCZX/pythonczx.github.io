Not sure if it‚Äôs really always been this way, but in the wake of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">Musk-ening of Twitter</a> that birthed (or rekindled) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23429095/twitter-social-network-alternatives-mastodon-reddit-tumblr-cohost">so many other social platforms</a>, my feed(s) are constantly a-buzz with hot-takes, analyses, <a href="/notes/2024/02/23/exhausted-by-social-platform-cheerleading">cheerleading</a> and more, all about social media itself. So, to add to that, here‚Äôs some <em>musings</em> on what‚Äôs goin‚Äô on in the social media landscape right now‚Ä¶<hr /><h1 id="bluesky">Bluesky</h1><p>Let‚Äôs start with <a href="https://bsky.app">Bluesky</a>. For whatever reason (probably <a href="https://www.euronews.com/culture/2024/11/13/how-the-us-election-result-is-pushing-social-media-users-away-from-x-and-onto-bluesky">anti-‚ÄúX‚Äù sentiment</a> following the US election), <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293920/bluesky-700000-new-users-week-x-threads">Bluesky is seeing a surge in new users</a>. I‚Äôve experienced this first-hand in fact. I have a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shellsharks.com">Bluesky account</a> and (probably thanks to a <a href="#on-starter-packs">Starter Pack</a> or two that I am in) I have seen a ton of follows lately, nearly 1k+ in the past few days alone. This has unsurprisingly resulted in a lot of chatter on my Mastodon/Fedi feeds about Bluesky. A fair bit of, ‚Äú<em>Bluesky looks cool, I‚Äôm going to check it out</em>‚Äù, ‚Äú<em>I‚Äôm going to move over to Bluesky permanently</em>‚Äù and of course, stuff like ‚Äú<em>Bluesky is a VC-funded, faux-decentralized bad place that will enshittify and fail in the same way Twitter did</em>‚Äù. <em>Yeah</em>, <a href="#bluesky-emotions">people are hot about it</a>.<p>At a surface level, I understand. People want <em>their</em> network to ‚Äúwin‚Äù. They want the people they care about to be on the same network they are, not fragmented. They also don‚Äôt want to have to pick up and move to another place and rebuild their community, etc‚Ä¶ <em>I get it</em>. There‚Äôs a lot I <em>could</em> say about Bluesky, and maybe one day I might say more, but for the sake of this note, I‚Äôll limit things to a few select topics‚Ä¶<ul><li><a href="#bluesky-emotions">Negative emotions regarding folks going to Bluesky</a><li><a href="#jack-dorsey">Jack Dorsey</a><li><a href="#vc-backed">Bluesky funding</a><li><a href="#is-bluesky-decentralized">Is Bluesky decentralized?</a><li><a href="#what-i-think-you-should-do">What I think you should do</a><li><a href="#bridgy-fed">Bridgy Fed</a><li><a href="#on-starter-packs">Starter Packs</a></ul><h2 id="bluesky-emotions">Bluesky Emotions</h2><p>Bluesky is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293920/bluesky-700000-new-users-week-x-threads">popping off</a>, people are leaving X en-masse it seems, and there are some who are also leaving Threads and Mastodon to ‚Äúlive‚Äù there too. So you have those on Bluesky cheering that they‚Äôve ‚Äúwon‚Äù, or that they‚Äôve <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hailey.at/post/3lasky252dc2i">reached the top of the charts</a> (on the Apple App Store) and you have those on the fled networks (namely Mastodon) bemoaning that anyone would leave as Bluesky is yet another corpo-owned, <a href="#vc-backed">VC-backed</a>, <a href="#is-bluesky-decentralized">centralized</a> network, <a href="#longevity-of-bluesky">doomed</a> to the same enshittified/billionaire-owned future as the rest of them. <em>Phew</em>! That‚Äôs a lot of emotions ‚Äì&gt; <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davxy/113480586904963235">1</a>, <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@securingdev/113481633335287189">2</a>, <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@eric_capuano/113478260587581071">3</a>, <a href="https://esq.social/@andrew/113477122438980886">4</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@yorush/post/DCR0qvBOOdw">5</a>, <a href="https://swecyb.com/@nopatience/113482488715466008">6</a>, <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@davidculley/113474658103543325">7</a>, <a href="https://universeodon.com/@cryptadamist/113472115447080382">8</a>, <a href="https://hackers.town/@CyberpunkLibrarian/113483028690175386">9</a>, <a href="https://syzito.xyz/@Black_Flag/113486698746459772">10</a>, <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@timb_machine/113487227663724826">11</a> and so many more‚Ä¶<p>All of the networks, yes, even ‚ÄúX‚Äù have their pros and cons - depending on what you want and who you are. The ‚Äú<a href="https://fedi.tips/what-is-mastodon-what-is-the-fediverse/">Fediverse</a>‚Äù, being <em>truly</em> decentralized, and not owned or funded by VC/corporations means it has <a href="/notes/2023/11/16/hark-threaders-the-fediverse-is-good-for-you">certain qualities</a> that many of us value. It also means it lacks certain things that are present in centralized, or better-funded operations such as <a href="#threads">Threads</a> or <a href="#bluesky">Bluesky</a>.<p>So, you‚Äôre interested in joining Bluesky. Should you try it out?<h6 id="do-it">Do it.</h6><p>If <a href="#bluesky">Bluesky</a> is where the action is. If it‚Äôs where your friends are. If it‚Äôs where the accounts you want to follow are. If it‚Äôs where your audience is. Then <strong>go there</strong>. <em>Be there</em>.<p>Even if you <em>knew</em> it would meet the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/11/23019836/elon-musk-twitter-board-of-directors-news-updates">same fate as Twitter</a> ultimately did, would you not ride that ride for 15 years? For all of Twitter‚Äôs faults, even pre-Musk, people <em>loved</em> it. Twitter helped birth and incubate countless relationships, communities, businesses and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23972308/twitter-x-death-tweets-history-elon-musk">more</a>. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, and it wasn‚Äôt forever. But it was great for so many, and for a non-trivial amount of time.<p>Bluesky <em>could</em> be this too, for as long as capitalism allows. For many, maybe for most, it would be worth spending 10-15 years there only to meet the same calamitous end rather than homesteading in Fedi-land where yeah, they may achieve true social longevity outside of corporate control but would also sacrifice all they may be able to build in what could amount to a true ‚ÄúTwitter 2.0‚Äù.<p>I‚Äôm Fedi-first. I like it here. I <em>value</em> the <a href="/notes/2023/11/16/hark-threaders-the-fediverse-is-good-for-you">qualities</a> of the Fediverse that no other platform offers. I like that I can own my own instance. I like that I can‚Äôt be deplatformed. I like that I don‚Äôt see ads. I like that it can‚Äôt be taken down by a billionaire or a single government. I like a lot of things about it. I‚Äôve also put the time and effort in to build a community here, to curate a very lively and fulfilling feed. I don‚Äôt fault anyone for going to Bluesky. If you like it there, great! I hope I get to see you through <a href="#bridgy-fed">the bridge</a>. If you don‚Äôt end up liking it there. Well maybe you‚Äôll come back to the Fediverse ‚ÅÇ.<p>It seems others too are optimistic, even if mildly cautious, about the future of Bluesky.

Yes, Dorsey did help fund Bluesky <a href="https://x.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">in the beginning</a>. But has since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/07/jack-dorsey-quits-bluesky-board-urges-users-stay-elon-musk-x-twitter">cut ties</a>, left their board and gone on to twiddle away with <a href="https://nostr.com">Nostr</a> and tell people to stay on X ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. So is his early involvement alone enough to curse the Bluesky project for eternity? I personally don‚Äôt think so. But <em>you do you</em>.<h6 id="vc-backed">VC-Backed</h6><p><strong>Yes</strong>. Bluesky did recently receive 15 million dollars in a Series A funding round, the majority of that money coming from the VC firm <a href="https://www.blockchaincapital.com/blog/bluesky-13m-users-and-growing-our-investment-in-blueskys-re-imagined-social-network">Blockchain Capital</a> (BCAP). What does this mean? <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a">Bluesky will tell you</a> that their new benefactor ‚Äú<em>shares our philosophy</em>‚Äù and that neither the Bluesky app, nor underlying <a href="https://atproto.com">AT Protocol</a> uses blockchains and/or cryptocurrency. That is all well and good. <em>For now</em>.<p>I‚Äôm no expert on how venture capital works, so excuse me if I say anything incorrect or naive, but my understanding is these firms don‚Äôt just <em>give money away</em>. They expect high-growth, and they expect a <strong>return</strong> on their investment. Even if they have no intention of somehow influencing Bluesky to incorporate any blockchain and/or cryptocurrency related technologies into the platform, they do at minimum expect Bluesky to make money, and a lot of it. So how will Bluesky do that? Right now they‚Äôre early stage. So it‚Äôs fine if they don‚Äôt have a monetization strategy that can yield the type of growth that BCAP expects. So far, all we know about how they plan to continue funding is <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan">this</a>. Yeah, selling domain names isn‚Äôt going to be enough. Maybe they have some ideas up their sleeves. Or maybe they don‚Äôt now, but they will later. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mmasnick.bsky.social/post/3lauwsf4eic27">Who knows</a>.<p>Look at how other similar platforms have made their returns and you start to see the issues. We‚Äôve got selling ads, selling user data, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278666/bluesky-working-on-premium-subscription">premium</a>‚Äù subscriptions and worse. Best case scenario (from my perspective), their dream of <strong><a href="#is-bluesky-decentralized">decentralization</a></strong> will be realized and the costs of running the network will transition to smaller, indepedent entities, thus alleviating the funding burden to a degree. But how will those entities, in turn fund their operations? By the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshitty</a> means? Or through crowd-sourced user donations (similar to the Fediverse model)? On this, I‚Äôd love to see them thread the needle, and succeed where no other network has yet to. But I (and others) remain skeptical.<ul><li><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/02/ulysses-pact/#tie-yourself-to-a-federated-mast">Bluesky and enshittification</a><li><a href="https://toad.social/@davetroy/113476788536250587">Bluesky funding and origins</a><li><a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/a0mlkrgmas5i01j0">Concern about Bluesky‚Äôs adjaceny to fascism</a><li><a href="https://merveilles.town/@lrhodes/113498554023468458">VC funding is runway | L.

To start, I‚Äôll say that Bluesky is in no meaningful way decentralized <strong>at the moment</strong>. <em>Sure</em>, they‚Äôve open sourced <em>some</em> stuff to allow you to, in theory, stand up (<a href="https://alice.bsky.sh/post/3laega7icmi2q">most of</a>) the infra to have a decentralized node on the network, but no meaningful amount of accounts live outside of the main centralized Bluesky corp-owned stack.<p>But <em>can</em> Bluesky <em>be</em> decentralized? This is up for debate it seems. There are two parts of this story to me. The <strong>can</strong> and the <strong>will</strong>. On whether it <em>can</em> be decentralized, you‚Äôre welcome to peruse the <a href="https://atproto.com">AT Protocol</a> documentation and decide for yourself. Others, smarter and more determined than myself have done this and came away rather, <em>unconvinced</em> (read: <a href="https://rys.io/en/167.html">BlueSky is cosplaying decentralization</a> &amp; <a href="https://destructured.net/bluesky-structure">The structure of the Bluesky network</a>). Again, maybe it‚Äôs <em>technically</em> possible to have truly decentralized stacks that can operate independently (though again, there‚Äôs that pesky <a href="https://alice.bsky.sh/post/3laega7icmi2q">AppView</a> issue right now).<p>Let‚Äôs just <em>assume</em> that it is possible. So the question then becomes, <em>will</em> people actually do this? Will <em>enough</em> people stand up fully-functioning, isolated but connected instances of the entire Bluesky tech stack? This is the more meaningful question I think. As we have seen with the ‚ÄúFediverse‚Äù, decentralization can be messy. It requires people understand the technology and be able to correctly build and maintain the necessary infrastructure. It requires folks to then <em>fund</em> that infrastructure. <strong>Not easy</strong>. In the Bluesky universe, who‚Äôs going to do this? Individuals? Communities? Other corporations? What is the incentive? In so many ways, the people who have gravitated <em>to</em> Bluesky and other centralized platforms is for no other reason than that it <em>is</em> centralized. That <em>is</em> the benefit. If Bluesky achieves any meaningful level of decentralization, and that‚Äôs a big IF, they will then have the same issues that have plagued the Fediverse, i.e. instance-to-instance incompatibility, fiefdoms, instance closure (due to funding-issues among other things), annoyance around what instance to join, etc‚Ä¶ Sure, Bluesky has solved for some of this with their admittedly great version of portable identity on the network, but I still think any decentralized future for Bluesky will introduce issues, most importantly, issues that prevent Bluesky from ever reaching <em>meaningful</em> levels of decentrality.<ul><li><a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/5-5-2023-federation-architecture">Federation Architecture Overview</a><li><a href="https://social.wildeboer.net/@jwildeboer/113487613965056474">Bluesky isn‚Äôt decentralized or federated | Jan Wildeboer</a><li><a href="https://whtwnd.com/bnewbold.net/3lbvbtqrg5t2t">Reply on Bluesky and Decentralization</a></ul><h2 id="what-i-think-you-should-do">What I Think You Should Do</h2><p>Alright, so you‚Äôre joining <a href="#bluesky">Bluesky</a>, or maybe you‚Äôre <em>thinking</em> about it being your primary social platform.

But here‚Äôs some things you might consider doing in tandem‚Ä¶<h3 id="bridgy-fed">Bridgy Fed</h3><p><a href="https://fed.brid.gy">Bridgy Fed</a> is an awesome service that among other things, can bridge accounts from the Fediverse to Bluesky and in reverse from Bluesky to the Fediverse. From the Bridgy Fed website, ‚Äú<em>You can use it to make your profile on one visible in another, follow people, see their posts, and reply and like and repost them. Interactions work in both directions as much as possible</em>‚Äù. It‚Äôs easy to do!<p>Got a fediverse account?

Bridge it to the fediverse by following <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ap.brid.gy">@ap.brid.gy</a><p>This means you can live blissfully wherever you like but still participate in and connect with those who are on the other network. It‚Äôs easy to do!<h3 id="start-a-blog">Start a blog</h3><p>I‚Äôm an <a href="/indieweb">IndieWeb</a> enthusiast and <a href="/you-should-blog">big proponent</a> of everyone having their own website/blog. But what does that have to do with my choice of social media platform? It boils down to this. Social platforms rise and fall, and when they fall, so too does your account which has likely served as your identity for and on the web. By having a website (or a ‚Äúblog‚Äù), you can anchor your identity to your <em>domain name</em> rather than some @twitter.com or @bsky.social or @whatever handle. Bluesky has actually realized this as something that is important and you are able to <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">register a domain name as your actual handle</a> on the service. <em>Nice!</em> But this only <em>kinda</em> helps.<p>Sure, people might now <em>know</em> me now as ‚Äúshellsharks.com‚Äù on Bluesky, but if I had no blog, and Bluesky were to go <a href="#longevity-of-bluesky">belly up</a>, people wouldn‚Äôt be able to find me as I wouldn‚Äôt exist anywhere except on Bluesky. But since I <em>do</em> have a website, people can continue to find me, connect with me, see what I have to say, etc‚Ä¶ by going to my domain. So sure. Use Bluesky if you want as your main social network. But go buy a domain, register it as your handle on Bluesky and then put <em>something</em> on that domain that resolves in a browser so people can find you now and into the future.<h3 id="xposting">XPosting</h3><p>I see a lot of people suggest cross-posting to those who are thinking of ‚Äúmoving‚Äù to Bluesky. They‚Äôll say, ‚Äú<em>Hey! instead of just posting to Bluesky, why don‚Äôt you post both places?</em>‚Äù. I personally don‚Äôt like this. What I mean is that I think cross-posting comes with a lot of compromises, that for me, and I assume for so many others, doesn‚Äôt make it worth it.<p>Cross-posting requires using an app built with this functionality, the ability to sign into multiple platforms. This may just not be the app someone wants to use. Though I will say there are some good options, <a href="https://openvibe.social">Openvibe</a>, <a href="https://croissantapp.com">Croissant</a>, <a href="https://mszpro.com/sorasns/">SoraSNS</a>, etc‚Ä¶ Second, in my experience audiences are just, <em>different</em> on the different platforms. What you might say on one isn‚Äôt necessarily what you would say on the other. So just posting the exact same thing word-for-word across both might not really <em>work</em>. It can also be somewhat <em>impersonal</em>. So now there is the mental overhead of tweaking posts across each or deciding when you want to x-post or not. Posting across multiple networks also means fielding replies across both. Again, more work. We all arguably spend too much time already on social media, just on one platform, much less trying to juggle communities and relationships across both.<p>So yeah, maybe cross posting is something you can do, or would like to do. But I certainly wouldn‚Äôt fault you for not doing it.<h2 id="on-starter-packs">On Starter Packs</h2><p>A <em>very</em> popular feature of Bluesky is their <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs">Starter Pack</a>. It‚Äôs basically a list of accounts you can give a name and people can peruse those lists, following individual accounts or clicking ‚ÄúFollow All‚Äù to follow everyone in the pack. It‚Äôs extremely easy to use, easy to create and at first glance, a great way to build your network and improve discoverability. Or so I thought‚Ä¶<p>In the past 72 hours I‚Äôve gone from like 200 followers to ~1.2k followers. I‚Äôm almost <em>certain</em> this is because of my placement in a popular starter pack or two. <em>Awesome right</em>? More people will see what I post and might respond to me. But has it worked out that way? Hard to say, and engagement is a tricky thing to scientifically evaluate, but I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs having that effect. What I <em>think</em> is happening, and what I <em>know</em> I‚Äôve personally done, is just blindly follow everyone in a given pack with no real evaluation. I think this has a devaluing effect on my feed.<p>Maybe I‚Äôm just used to the highly curated aspect of my Fedi feed. But damnit if that feed on Mastodon isn‚Äôt <em>extremely</em> high fidelity. It should be right? I‚Äôve hand selected every account I follow through somewhat rigorous means. Not just willy-nilly following 80 people in one fell swoop. What happens is this, for lack of a better word, junks up the feed. I‚Äôm someone who likes to read through my timeline, see what everyone has said. But on Bluesky, thanks to the fact that timeline position, when refreshed, sends you to the top, and the effects of these starter packs, I find that my feed is just an unruly mess that I can‚Äôt stay on top of and as a result find less interesting. Then, frustrated with my ‚ÄúFollowing‚Äù feed, I‚Äôll check out the default algorithmic ‚ÄúDiscover‚Äù feed, which tends to just be memes and ‚Äúbig accounts‚Äù - <em>yawn</em>.<p>Another set of pitfalls I see with starter packs is ongoing management and redundancies. In just a few short days I‚Äôve seen quite a few ‚ÄúInfosec‚Äù starter packs pop up. If you‚Äôre an infosec person, and you want to be featured in the pack, which do you choose? Which will be the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù ones? Who created the pack? Will they keep it up-to-date? Do you feel comfortable pinging someone asking to be included in a pack? Will it become a popularity contest? I don‚Äôt know how to answer or really analyze much of this at this point, but I just see potential issues. That said, I still think it‚Äôs a great idea and does make following a lot of accounts a lot easier. Generic packs like ‚Äúinfosec‚Äù might be hard to maintain and be extremely unruly (100‚Äôs of people) but smaller, more focused packs, e.g. writers at <a href="https://bsky.app/start/did:plc:cjfcz3t36f6nrprarkhkycxo/3laojwpjit62a">404 Media</a> are perfect!<hr /><h1 id="threads">Threads</h1><p>If you‚Äôre going to talk social media, it‚Äôs hard to ignore <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/introducing-threads-new-app-text-sharing/">Threads</a>. Afterall, Threads still boasts over 200 million users and has 10‚Äôs of millions of daily active users (<a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/threads-users">src</a>). Contrast that with <a href="#bluesky">Bluesky</a> or Mastodon‚Äôs relatively paltry sub-20m total users each. But Threads is flagging. People are unhappy with the choices the leadership/development teams have continued to make around <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266096/instagram-threads-moderation-account-post-deleted-limited">algorithmic choices</a> and more. I don‚Äôt use Threads much. I feel the same about Threads as I do Bluesky for the most part. If you like it there, and its where your ‚Äúpeople‚Äù are, then <a href="#do-it">be there</a>. It has some of the same, and some different risks as Bluesky, but whatever.<p>The <em>interesting</em> wrinkle with Threads is the ongoing <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/21/networking-traffic/threads-has-entered-the-fediverse/">implementation of ActivityPub</a>. Currently, Threads users who decide to opt in to the ‚Äú<a href="https://help.instagram.com/760878905943039">Fediverse sharing</a>‚Äù beta can enjoy a very half-baked, but not entirely useless form of federation that allows users on the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù fediverse to see and even reply to posts you make natively on Threads. Actually <em>kinda cool</em>. You can‚Äôt yet follow native Fediverse users from Threads, but in theory that is coming in the not too distant future. I think if this ever does materialize, and does so in a non-compromising way, it will be a feature that gives those on Threads a real benefit over those on Bluesky. Afterally, the <a href="#bridgy-fed">Bridgy Fed</a>, Bluesky &lt;‚Äì&gt; Fedi bridge is cool, but comes with plenty of compromises as it would compare to true Federation.<hr /><h1 id="the-future">The Future</h1><p>I can‚Äôt see the future. Who knows what will happen. But there is a non-zero chance that <a href="#bluesky">Bluesky</a> fails to truly <a href="#is-bluesky-decentralized">decentralize</a>, and the main/centralized instance of the platform is forced to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">enshittify</a> in some disastrous way. Simultaneously, (in this same timeline) <a href="#threads">Threads</a> has continued to decline in user experience thanks to an increasingly heavy-handed algorithm, inability to moderate spam accounts and overpopulation of corporate or advertising-related posts/accounts. Where do people go? Will they stay on those centralized platforms, accepting the compromises for what they are and muddle through? Will a new shiny platform pop up and people go there? What will it take for the ‚Äú<a href="https://fediverse.info">Fediverse</a>‚Äù to get real traction? What features do we need? What cultural shift needs to happen? What big ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù accounts would need to set up shop here? I can‚Äôt say. I think improving discoverability by copying some of Bluesky‚Äôs popular features, namely <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/starter-templates/custom-feeds">custom feeds</a> (opt-in algos) and <a href="#on-starter-packs">starter packs</a> could really help. I also think improving the identity model, also similar to how Bluesky has done it by being <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">domain backed</a>, could also help. Beyond that, moderation improvements and instance choice/onboarding could use a freshen-up to help people feel less intimidated by joining.<p>An exciting time to be sure!<h3 id="more">More</h3><ul><li><a href="https://america2.news/without-sky-social-media-and-the-end-of-reality/">Without Sky: Social Media and the End of Reality</a></ul></div><div style="bottom:-5px; text-align:right;font-size:0.75em;"><i class="ph ph-pencil"></i> 3427</div><hr style="opacity:35%;margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 10px;width:75%;"><div id="info" class="wrapper"><div class="box 1" style="background-color:var(--background-color);"><div><i class="ph ph-note-pencil"></i> <span id="updated" style="font-size:0.75em;">3/3/25 14:53</span></div><div><i class="ph ph-map-pin-area" title="Posted from"></i> <span id="posted-from" style="font-size:0.75em;">Mac Pro 2019</span></div><div><i class="ph ph-broadcast"></i><span style="font-size:0.75em;"> Syndication:</span></div><div style="font-size:1.5em;"><span id="syndicate-to"> <span style="padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;"><a href="https://shellsharks.social/@shellsharks/113488508970163751"><i class="ph ph-mastodon-logo" title="Mastodon"></i></a></span> </span></div></div><div class="box2" style="bottom:0;"><div style="text-align:right; padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;"><a class="u-url" href=""><i class="ph ph-link" title="Permalink"></i></a> <a href="/notebook"><i class="ph ph-book-open" title="Notebook"></i></a> <a href="/"><i class="ph ph-house" title="Home"></i></a></div><div style="font-size:0.75em;color:var(--light-font-color);padding:5px 5px 0px 5px;text-align:right;"><i class="ph ph-tag"></i> <span id="tags" style="padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;"><a href="/tags?tag=life">#life</a></span> <span id="tags" style="padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;"><a href="/tags?tag=social">#social</a></span></div></div></div></div></article><div style="margin-bottom:20px; margin-right:5px; margin-left:5px;"> <a class="prev" style="margin-right: 2em; margin-left:8px;" href="/notes/2024/11/15/shellsharks-social-113487338631713687#title">&laquo; shellsharks.social 11/15/24 09:02 EST</a><div style="float:right;"><a class="next" href="/notes/2024/11/18/hold-the-line-stay-with-me#title" style="margin-right: 8px;">Hold the line!
