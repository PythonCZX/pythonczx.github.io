/* Tools */
  A list of tools my site leverages to implement IndieWeb functionality.
  - GoDaddy: https://www.godaddy.com
  - GitHub Pages: https://pages.github.com
  - Jekyll: https://jekyllrb.com
  - lunr.js: https://lunrjs.com

/* Strategies */
  I am really just beginning the IndieWeb evolution for my site. My only IndieWeb-like strategy up until now has been to maintain a web presence (this site) where I publish my most important content and POSSE that out to various social networks.

/* Why */
  Some insight into why I've gone down the IndieWeb path can be seen in the opening sections of the following two posts.
