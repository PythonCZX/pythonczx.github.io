For many who are looking to <a href="/getting-into-information-security#title">get into information security</a>, <a href="/training-retrospective#my-education-journey">finding that first job</a> can be very difficult. Typical recommended paths <em>into</em> infosec include roles such as help desk, SIOC/SOC, system administration, network engineering or even software development. Though there is no one path that is universally best, I believe VM <em>can</em> be an <a href="#vm-compared-to-other-infosec-starter-roles">optimal choice</a> for a number of different reasons.<h5 id="why-start-your-infosec-career-with-vulnerability-management">Why Start Your Infosec Career with Vulnerability Management</h5><ul><li>A lot of <em>true</em> <a href="/cybersecurity-role-map#title">infosec positions</a> are not really considered ‚Äújunior‚Äù or ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù (e.g. penetration testing, threat hunting, reverse engineering, application security, etc‚Ä¶) This means it is difficult to jump directly into those roles without some prior experience <em>in</em> infosec. VM however, <em>is</em> considered junior and thus is more readily attainable by those with little-to-no prior infosec experience.<li>Unlike other recommended ‚Äú<a href="#vm-compared-to-other-infosec-starter-roles">starter</a>‚Äù roles (i.e. help desk, system administration, etc‚Ä¶), VM is a <em>true</em> infosec role. What I mean by this is, having the title ‚ÄúVulnerability Management‚Äù (or some derivation of this title) on your resume counts towards years of experience <em>in cybersecurity</em> whereas having help desk (for example) experience on your resume would likely not be considered infosec-relevant experience.<li>VM (in my opinion), is <em>easier</em> to learn the basics of as compared to <a href="#vm-compared-to-other-infosec-starter-roles">other potential starter positions</a>. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, you certainly need to have a <em>breadth</em> of knowledge in a number of different areas but you don‚Äôt (for example) need to be able to fully administer Linux/Windows, or engineer a network, or perform in-depth packet analysis, or be an expert coder to work in VM (though it wouldn‚Äôt hurt!). You need only have (at least starting out) a relatively foundational grasp of a <a href="#vm-knowledge-pre-requisites">handful of knowledge areas</a>.<li>Those in VM roles are exposed to a wide variety of other infosec domains. For example, in performing the <a href="#vulnerability-management-day-to-day">week-to-week responsibilities</a> of a VM <a href="#vm-analysis">analyst</a>/<a href="#vm-engineering">engineer</a>, you will encounter vulnerabilities that a penetration tester would also encounter, you may be asked to <a href="#risk-analysis">assess the risk</a> of scan findings similar to what a GRC analyst would be asked to do, you could also be asked how to patch or mitigate issues like a system administrator would need to do, etc‚Ä¶ Collectively, these experiences are great for building a solid generalist base of knowledge and could also help you pivot into other areas of infosec if/when you are ready to do so.<li><strong>Penetration testing</strong> is a very sought-after infosec position but can be out-of-reach for many entry-level professionals. This is for good reason as penetration testing requires skills and experience that are a bit more advanced. VM is a great stepping-stone to a career in penetration testing as you get a lot of hands-on experience with the vulnerabilities you will be exploiting as a penetration tester. (<strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>This statement is not meant to discourage those looking to get into penetration testing early in their careers. It certainly</em> <strong>can</strong> <em>be done!</em>)<li>VM analysts typically get a good bit of face-time across IT organizations. What I mean by this is that you will likely be asked to interface with a wide variety of groups within IT - server teams, desktop teams, development teams, IT leadership, etc‚Ä¶ This exposure helps network you around the organization and also gives you the opportunity to learn from a diverse set of personalities and professionals.<li>VM is (<em>or really should be</em>) <strong>ubiquitous</strong>. Since <a href="/symphonic-vulnerability-surface-mapping#a-primer-on-vulnerability-management">VM is fundamental</a> to all organizations, the need for qualified and/or knowledgeable VM professionals is abundant. In other words, there is a lot of opportunity in learning this particular craft. <em>With that said, there is an increasing prevalence of out-sourced, managed VM which means this function may become more and more commoditized.</em></ul><h5 id="vm-compared-to-other-infosec-starter-roles">VM Compared to Other Infosec Starter-Roles</h5><p>There are a number of different ‚Äústarter‚Äù roles one could consider as they begin their <a href="/getting-into-information-security#title">journey into infosec</a>. I personally believe VM is one of the better options as compared to these other roles. Some of the cons of these <em>other</em> roles are detailed below.<ul><li>In <strong>help desk</strong> roles, learning (specifically infosec-related learning) tends to stagnate, your ability to perform actual ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù work is limited, pay tends to be lower and opportunities to pivot into more security-specific roles are often non-existent or overly hard-fought. There also tends to be a stigma attached to ‚Äúhelp desk‚Äù which if you‚Äôre not careful, could hinder your ability to break out of that role and onto something more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù.<li>In <strong>SIOC/SOC</strong> or other <em>blue-team-analyst-type</em> roles, you get great exposure to ‚Äúreal‚Äù security work, but this often comes at the expense of jobs that are high stress, have weird/long hours and/or are very scripted in nature with respect to operational responsibilities, limiting the ability to learn and grow. A lot of individuals in these positions suffer from burn-out or other stress-related issues.<li>In <strong>system administration</strong> roles, you learn a great deal about the OS (i.e. Windows, Linux, Mac) you are administering but do not necessarily get to perform any security-specific work. This experience certainly comes in handy later in an infosec career but might not help too much for breaking into the field initially.<li>In <strong>network engineering</strong> roles, you can easily find yourself siloed into only performing network engineering and never getting to break out and do any actual security work. I‚Äôll add that this path requires quite a bit of technical depth on the networking side which makes this path particularly difficult for an entry-level individual. With that said, that knowledge could be of great use if/when you do ultimately move into a more security-specific position.<li><strong>Software development</strong> is a common first step for those who ultimately would like to end up in an ‚ÄúApplication Security‚Äù role. This makes sense considering knowing how to properly assess and secure applications likely means first having some understanding or experience writing/developing applications. With this said, it is a relatively serious commitment that must be made to become a software developer and is probably a bit over-kill if your goal is to <em>quickly</em> get into infosec-proper.</ul><hr /> <center><i class="ph ph-gear lg"></i></center><h2 id="vulnerability-management-day-to-day">Vulnerability Management Day-to-Day</h2><p>If you‚Äôre with me thus far, you‚Äôre likely <em>somewhat</em> interested in a getting a job in Vulnerability Management. You may however be wondering, ‚Äú<em>what exactly does someone in Vulnerability Management actually do?</em>‚Äù This is of course a very relevant question for someone thinking of going down this path so I‚Äôd like to try and cover it here. Though it can certainly vary from place to place, VM professionals typically have responsibilities in <em>three</em> functional areas - <strong><a href="#vm-operations">operations</a></strong>, <strong><a href="#vm-analysis">analysis</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#vm-engineering">engineering</a></strong>. I‚Äôll briefly explain VM responsibilities across each of these domains below‚Ä¶<h6 id="vm-operations"><strong>VM Operations</strong></h6><p>Though there are elements of VM <a href="#vm-analysis">analysis</a> or <a href="#vm-engineering">engineering</a> that could be considered <em>operational</em>, what I really mean by ‚Äúoperations‚Äù is, the every day break-fix, tuning and troubleshooting that a VM professional needs to do to keep <a href="#exercise-3-vulnerability-scanning">scans running on-time</a> and without failure as well as ensuring <a href="#exercise-6-reporting">reports/alerts are being generated</a> and delivered as required. Consider the list of potential <em>operational</em> tasks below‚Ä¶<ul><li><strong>Scan failures</strong>: If a scan fails to kick-off, finish or otherwise does not complete, the VM team will need to troubleshoot what happened. A scan may fail for a number of different reasons: the scanner itself may be malfunctioning, a firewall or IPS may be blocking scan traffic or the target endpoint could have shut off. <em>These are just a few examples</em>.<li><strong>False positives</strong>: Often, a system owner may contact the VM team because they believe a finding on a scan report is a <em>false positive</em>. It is then the VM team‚Äôs job to investigate this claim and determine whether it is indeed a false-positive or not. <strong>In my experience</strong>, especially when it comes to <em>credentialed scans</em>, it is <em>very rarely</em> a real false-positive. In any case, you will need to understand <em>and</em> be able to explain the <a href="https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/Plugins.htm">scan plugin</a> logic to the system owner that way there is a mutual understanding of why that plugin fired.<li><strong>Scan causes system degradation</strong>: Network scans <em>can</em> be somewhat invasive - both <em>on the network</em> as well as against a target host. Though modern operating systems and enterprise networks are fairly robust and thus less likely to have a negative reaction as a result of a common vulnerability scan, it is certainly still possible that a scan <em>could</em> cause network/system degradation. When this happens, the VM team may be contacted to disable the scan.<li><strong>Creating/maintaining scan jobs</strong>: One of the core tenets of VM is that of <em>visibility</em>. What this means is that to the best of our ability, we as the VM team would like to be scanning everything with the highest-fidelity (<a href="#exercise-3-vulnerability-scanning">credentialed</a>) scan type as possible. To achieve this, the VM team will often need to create additional scan jobs or modify existing ones as needed to further increase visibility.<li><strong>Credential failure</strong>: The highest-fidelity scan type is an <strong>authenticated</strong> scan. To achieve an authenticated scan you need proper credentials which have sufficient privileges on the target host. The scan job must then be populated with these credentials. For <a href="https://community.tenable.com/s/article/Troubleshooting-Credential-scanning-on-Windows">any number of reasons</a>, scans may fail to actually login to the host. When this occurs, the VM team will need to diagnose what has happened and fix the scan.<li><strong>Report/alert tweaking</strong>: A key facet of VM is ensuring that appropriate stakeholders <a href="#exercise-6-reporting">receive reports</a> which detail the information and specific findings relevant to them. The VM team is therefore responsible for building and maintaining these reports, regularly auditing whether they are being sent and received properly and that they have the correct and comprehensive data contained within them.</ul><h6 id="vm-analysis"><strong>VM Analysis</strong></h6><p>Much of the ‚Äúanalyst‚Äù work a VM professional does <em>could</em> be considered <em><a href="#vm-operations">operational</a></em> as it is something that might be performed on a day-to-day basis. However, I delineate between <em>analysis</em> work and <em>operations</em> based on the skillset needed to perform each. <em>VM analysis</em> is the process of reviewing scan results (and vulnerabilities in general) and performing analysis on these findings which leads to a better understanding of risk. This work stands in stark contrast to <em><a href="#vm-operations">operations</a></em>, which does not require having a deep understanding of threats, vulnerabilities and risk. Below are some examples of <em>VM analysis</em> work‚Ä¶<ul><li><strong>Creating dashboards/content</strong>: <a href="#vm-tools">Enterprise scan tools</a> have advanced <a href="https://docs.tenable.com/tenablesc/Content/Dashboards.htm">dashboarding</a> and other content-creation capabilities which allow VM analysts to quickly consume VM metrics, trends and other interesting data points related to organization-wide scan results. For example, the VM team may maintain a trend graph which shows the total high-risk vulnerabilities that have been present in the environment over the course of the year. Or, there may be a dashboard component which shows the number of outstanding vulnerabilities across each department within IT.<li><strong>Risk assessments</strong>: A common ask for the VM team is to produce a ‚Äúrisk assessment‚Äù related to a certain vulnerability against a specific system or as it applies to the organization as a whole. These risk assessments help IT leadership determine how to prioritize work. If the risk is high, business leaders and IT leadership must make decisions on risk mitigation.<li><strong><a href="/symphonic-vulnerability-surface-mapping#title">Triaging recently disclosed vulnerabilities</a></strong>: Often new vulnerabilities are <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-process">disclosed</a> and require speedy analysis from the VM team. In these cases <a href="#vm-tools">network scan vendors</a> will <a href="https://community.tenable.com/s/article/Tenable-Plugin-Release-Information">not have had time to write and publish detection plugins</a> for their respective scanners. When this happens, the VM team will be asked to triage these <em>new</em> vulnerabilities to determine their applicability to the organization‚Äôs environment, calculate potential risk and even research/produce possible risk treatments related to that vulnerability.<li><strong>Vulnerability validation</strong>: <a href="#vm-tools">Network scanners</a> are great at identifying vulnerabilities. What they <em>can‚Äôt</em> always do however is determine the ‚Äútrue risk‚Äù of a vulnerability based on the relevant network/host-based controls which may mitigate certain aspects of the respective issue. The VM team may be asked to analyze a vulnerability in the context of whether it is truly a risk to the system. In some cases this may mean trying to actively <em>exploit</em> that particular vulnerability to determine if the expected controls which may mitigate said issue <em>actually</em> do so. Though I wouldn‚Äôt call this ‚Äúpenetration testing‚Äù, it is similar in some ways.<li><strong>Reviewing scan results</strong>: VM analysts may spend a good bit of time simply reviewing the results of scans and evaluating whether any vulnerabilities require special or immediate attention. For example, if a new class of high-risk vulnerability appears in a scan result which does not have automated alerting or reporting content, a VM analyst may want to quickly catch it so it can be triaged accordingly.</ul><h6 id="vm-engineering"><strong>VM Engineering</strong></h6><p>Last but certainly not least, we have <em>VM engineering</em>. Engineering in this context is the design, build and maintenance of the architecture and infrastructure which support VM <a href="#vm-operations">operations</a> and <a href="#vm-analysis">analysis</a>. Some examples of VM engineering tasks are detailed below‚Ä¶<ul><li><strong>Patching</strong>: VM is supported by scanners, databases, <a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/tenable-sc/">central-consoles</a> and a lot of other infrastructure. This infrastructure must be kept up-to-date with the latest functional/security patches from their respective vendors. The VM team may be responsible for maintaining their own tools in this way. In many cases however, the responsibility of patching, even for VM infrastructure, is placed on an organization-wide patching team rather than resting on the system-owners themselves.<li><strong>Archictecture</strong>: As advancements are made, or perhaps as the VM program is first being built, there is a need to design an architecture for the VM program itself - especially as it relates to <a href="#vm-operations">scanning operations</a>. The VM team is responsible for designing and deploying VM-related hardware, determining where scanners are placed on the network and <em>much</em> more.<li><strong>Scan routing</strong>: In order to scan <em>all corners</em> of an enterprise network, the VM team must work with the network team to ensure <a href="https://www.tenable.com/blog/4-ways-to-improve-nessus-scans-through-firewalls">proper rules are in place on the firewalls</a> such that the scanners can traverse the network.<li><strong>New tooling</strong>: As modern enterprises continue to make strides into new computing frontiers (e.g. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/">cloud</a>, <a href="https://microservices.io">microservices</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/">serverless</a>, etc..), the VM team must keep up with respect to maintaining scan comprehension and visibility. To do so, new tools will likely need to be evaluated. Typically, this is done through trial-based, proof-of-concept engagements. The VM team will acquire the tool(s) and a trial license and have a limited amount of time to evaluate a new product to determine if it meets the VM-needs of the organization.<li><strong>*Scripting &amp; Automation</strong>: This final task is something that I believe spans <em>all three</em> VM functional areas. In order to get the most out of the tools you have in your <a href="#vm-tools">VM tool-kit</a> and to best solve the ‚Äúscaling‚Äù issue within infosec, VM professionals must be able to <a href="#exercise-7-scripting--automation">write scripts</a> and automate against <a href="https://restfulapi.net">RESTful APIs</a>. These <em>scripts</em> will likely perform operational tasks and therefore the maintenance and creation of these scripts could be considered <em>operational</em>. Similarly, these scripts may perform <a href="/symphonic-vulnerability-surface-mapping#symphonic-vulnerability-surface-mapping">automated analysis and triage</a> of VM findings. In this way, these scripts can also be considered ‚Äú<a href="#vm-analysis">analyst</a>‚Äù work. Collectively, I think they are also <em>engineering</em> in that they are somewhat one-time efforts (not counting maintenance and upgrades) which help add new functionality to the VM program.</ul><p><em>As you can see</em>! There is a lot of <em>interesting</em> work to be done in VM. Due to the breadth of responsibilties and the very nature of the work, I truly believe it is one of the <a href="#why-vulnerability-management">best starter infosec roles</a> out there.

I will be using <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html">VMware Fusion</a> during the exercises.<li><p>Once the virtualization tool is downloaded and installed, we need to acquire a VM which will host our <em>scanning tool</em> and effectively be the <strong>scanner</strong> host. For this, I recommend a <a href="https://www.linux.org">Linux</a> variant such as <a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali Linux</a> or <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Ubuntu</a>. I will be using Kali (64-bit) throughout the exercises. <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com">Offensive Security</a> actually maintains <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/">VMware and VirtualBox-specific Kali images</a> which I recommend using.<li><p>*If you‚Äôve downloaded the pre-configured <em>.vmwarevm</em> from Offensive Security, you can simply double-click the (un-zipped) file and it should open up in VMware with no other setup required.<li><p>Otherwise, once we have downloaded the VM, we need to unpack, install and perform the initial setup of the VM within our virtualization tool. <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-vmware-guest-vm/">Here is a guide for installing Kali inside VMware</a>. When asked to <em>name</em> the VM, give it an appropriate name such as ‚ÄúScanner‚Äù. I recommend giving it as much RAM and CPU as you can spare. Scanning can be somewhat resource-intensive so the more power the VM has the better. <strong>Keep in mind</strong>, you will also need to run a second VM simultaneously so don‚Äôt spend all your computer‚Äôs resources in one place! The pre-configured <em>.vmwarevm</em> image from Offensive Security has 2GB RAM, and 80GB virtual hard drive, I think this is sufficient for this exercise.<li><p>To start, have the VM configured in <strong><a href="https://www.vmware.com/support/ws5/doc/ws_net_configurations_nat.html">NAT</a></strong> mode (a.k.a. ‚Äú<a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Fusion/12/com.vmware.fusion.using.doc/GUID-E498672E-19DD-40DF-92D3-FC0078947958.html">Share with my Mac</a>‚Äù on Mac devices). This is to ensure that the Kali VM is able to download updates and additional tools needed for the <a href="#bootcamp-lab-exercises">bootcamp exercises</a>.<li><p>To initially get into our Kali instance, use the credentials <em>kali</em> / <em>kali</em>. I recommend <strong>immediately</strong> changing your <em>kali</em> user password. Here is a <a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-change-user-password-in-linux/">guide on how to change a Linux password</a>. Once this is done, run <em>sudo apt-get update</em> and then <em>sudo apt-get upgrade</em> (typing ‚ÄúY‚Äù to confirm the upgrade) to update your system tools to the latest versions. This may take a few minutes to complete.<li><p>Now that our <em>scanner</em> VM base image is set up and ready to go, we need to register for a <a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials">Nessus Essentials</a> activation code. Once submitting your registration, you should receive an email from <em>no-reply@tenable.com</em> with your License key and a button-<a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-plugins/thank-you-for-registering">link to download Nessus</a>.<li><p>Within Kali, open the Nessus download link which will take you to the <a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-plugins/thank-you-for-registering">Nessus downloads page</a>.

Using <em>hping3</em> you can custom-build ICMP, UDP and TCP packets to an exact specification and then fire them off to test firewalls, perform port scanning, fingerprint OS‚Äôs and <em>a lot</em> more. <em>hping3</em> is similar in some ways to <em><a href="#Nmap">Nmap</a></em> but much lighter-weight which makes it particularly good for quick troubleshooting.<p>To get started, I recommend reviewing the <em>hping3</em> ‚Äú<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html">man page</a>‚Äù to get a better idea of its capabilities and the flags required to invoke different functionality.<p>OK, now let‚Äôs get an idea of the listening services on the Metasploitable box. We can do so by running ‚Äú<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/513003/how-to-use-netstat-on-linux/">netstat</a> -tulpn‚Äù on the Metasploitable host.<p><img src="https://shellsharks-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/vm-bootcamp/netstat.png" alt="netstat" /><p>From the output of the <em>netstat</em> command, we can see there are quite a few listening services. Moving over to the Kali <em>scanner</em> host, we can use the <em>hping3</em> command below to verify whether services are reachable from our scan host. The command below demonstrates that TCP port 53 on the Metasploitable is responding to <em>SYN</em> packets from our <em>scanner</em> host.<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>hping3 <span class="nt">-S</span> <span class="nt">-c</span> 1 <span class="nt">-p</span> 53 172.16.84.3

This handy tool is useful when diagnosing routing failures which may exist between a scan host and the target host.<p>This short exercise will demonstrate the route a network packet takes from your Kali system to your actual router/gateway. First, <a href="https://nordvpn.com/blog/find-router-ip-address/">figure out the IP address of your router</a>. An easy way to do this may be to just run <em>ipconfig</em>/<em>ifconfig</em>, figure out your parent host IP address and then change the fourth octet to a ‚Äú1‚Äù. For example, if your parent host IP is <em>192.168.1.39</em>, your router‚Äôs IP may likely be <em>192.168.1.1</em>. <em>OK</em>, with your router IP address in-hand, go back to your Kali system and try the following <em>traceroute</em> command. <em>Replace 192.168.1.1 with the IP address of your router</em>.<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>traceroute 192.168.1.1

</code></pre></div></div><p>Here you will see that in order for the packet to reach its destination (the router IP), it had to traverse the IP <em>172.16.84.1</em> which is the internal gateway for your virtualized host. On my parent host machine, this is the <em>bridge100</em> VMware interface (which can be seen by running <em>ifconfig</em> on the parent host).<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bridge100: <span class="nv">flags</span><span class="o">=</span>8a63&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,ALLMULTI,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500

Network scanning tools have a number of different methods for detecting vulnerabilities, two of these methods are <strong><a href="#credentialed-scan">credentialed</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#uncredentialed-scan">uncredentialed</a></strong> scanning. Ideally, where possible, you want all scans to be credentialed. Credentialed scans have higher-fidelity results (less false-positives) and they also find <em>more</em> issues overall. With that said, you won‚Äôt always have credentials for a target so you may have to settle for an uncredentialed scan. These two types of scans also function a little differently. Credentialed scans will actually ‚Äúphysically‚Äù login to a target system and enumerate vulnerabilities by running commands directly on the system. Uncredentialed scans on the other hand, are unable to login to the target system and must instead rely on anonymous/remote fingerprinting mechanisms to detect potential vulnerabilities.

We need to start filtering down to just the ones that are of highest importance.<li>Are there any vulnerabilities that are of <em>imminent</em> danger of being exploited? If so, are any of these vulnerabilities mitigated in any way due to other controls within the environment?<li>We can add a filter to see only <em>exploitable</em> vulnerabilities.

The <em>best</em> way to do that is by leveraging the <a href="https://community.tenable.com/s/article/An-introduction-to-the-Nessus-API-generating-session-tokens-and-API-keys">Nessus API</a>. The API documentation is available locally within your Nessus instance at ‚Äú<em>https://127.0.0.1:8834/api#/overview</em>‚Äù. The API represents boundless opportunity for VM <a href="#vm-analysis">analysts</a>/<a href="#vm-engineering">engineers</a> to automate all manner of <a href="#vm-operations">operational tasks</a>, thus reducing overhead. I recommend those interested in not only VM but infosec at large, to become very familiar with <a href="https://restfulapi.net">APIs such as this</a> and learn to write against them programmatically using a scripting language such as <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>. To aid you in this journey there are frameworks, built by others in the community that can help you interact with these APIs. For the Nessus API, there is <a href="https://python-nessus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyNessus</a>, a Nessus REST API client which is fully <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2 licensed</a> and built specifically for security auditors, pentesters and VM analysts.<p>As I mentioned, there are countless potential automation ideas that one could think of. One possible project would be to create a script that could kick off a scan against a target system. The use-case for this project would be as follows‚Ä¶ As a VM analyst you may be asked by a system owner to re-scan a system following patch application. The system owner is interested in whether the patch has been successfully applied and thus the vulnerability is mitigated. Rather than wait for the next scan window, the system owner would like to know as soon as possible whether the vulnerability has been eradicated. Typically, a VM analyst would kick off a targeted scan of this system manually. But instead, what if you wrote a script that took one argument (a target IP) and auto-ran a scan of that system.<p>This bootcamp is not designed to be a course in Python and as such, will not cover in-depth how to create the script I detailed above. I recommend researching how best to programmatically interact with REST APIs. One good resource would be <a href="https://realpython.com/python-api/">Python &amp; APIs: A Winning Combo for Reading Public Data</a>. With that said, I would like to provide this script <em>myself</em> so others may have an example to build off of and reference as they create other useful scripts of their own.<p><strong>Example script is currently being developed. Stay tuned!</strong><p>Finally, I‚Äôd like to list a few other potential script ideas that someone could work on if they were interested!<ul><li><em>Building off the previous idea</em> - a script that could auto-run a scan against a provided target but <em>also</em> take as input a <a href="https://community.tenable.com/s/article/What-are-Plugin-ID-ranges-and-what-are-they-used-for">Plugin ID</a> and return <em>true</em> or <em>false</em> if that plugin is found within the results of that scan. Ultimately, the system owner is interested if a plugin has ‚Äúfallen off‚Äù the report so rather than go into the scan results and see manually, why not have the result returned programmatically.<li>A script that can take a list of plugins as input and return all the hosts that have one or more of those plugins. In the event of a large patch release by a vendor, we may want to quickly see all the hosts affected by a set of plugins.<li>A script that will take an IP as input and return the last time it was scanned, how long the scan was and whether it was successfully <a href="#credentialed-scan">scanned with credentials</a>. <em>This is a common question in the VM world</em>. Take this scenario as an example - there may be some issue (system degradation) with a system and the owner is wondering if the scan itself is the culprit. The system owner may provide logs indicating some malfunction during a certain time and would like to blame the scan for the degradation. You may be able to quickly diagnose this using this script which will tell you when the scan was last performed. If the scan timing overlaps with when the system was experiencing a degraded state, it may very well be the scanners fault. Otherwise, we can rule out the scanner as being the cause. Alternatively, you may find that the results of the scan look a little <em>off</em>, and you‚Äôd like to quickly troubleshoot whether the last scan was with credentials. As we know, <a href="#uncredentialed-scan">non-credentialed scans</a> can introduce false-positives into the scan results.</ul><p>Thanks for taking the time to work your way through these exercises and <strong>happy scriptin‚Äô</strong>!<hr /><h2 id="lab-exercise-answers">Lab Exercise Answers</h2><ul><li><a href="#exercise-0-answers">Exercise 0 Answers</a><li><a href="#exercise-1-answers">Exercise 1 Answers</a><li><a href="#exercise-2-answers">Exercise 2 Answers</a><li><a href="#exercise-3-answers">Exercise 3 Answers</a><li><a href="#exercise-4-answers">Exercise 4 Answers</a><li><a href="#exercise-5-answers">Exercise 5 Answers</a><li><a href="#exercise-6-answers">Exercise 6 Answers</a></ul><h3 id="exercise-0-answers">Exercise 0 Answers</h3><h6 id="answer-01">Answer 0.1</h6><p><strong>Kali credentials</strong>: <em>kali</em> / <em>kali</em><p><strong>Metasploitable 2 credentials</strong>: <em>msfadmin</em> / <em>msfadmin</em><p>To change the password for the user you are logged in as, simply type <em>passwd</em> and go through the prompts.

This is due to the readily available exploit code and high <em>Threat Intensity</em>.<p><a href="#question-32">Back to Question</a><h6 id="answer-33">Answer 3.3</h6><p>By opening up the <a href="#credentialed-scan">credentialed scan</a> results and clicking on the ‚ÄúVPR Top Threats‚Äù tab, you will see several Critical severity issues. The top issue is ‚Äú<a href="https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/77823">Bash Remote Code Execution</a>‚Äù, with a VPR severity score of 9.8. This is scored higher than the <a href="#answer-32">previously identified hihg-risk issue in the uncredentialed scan</a> due to its <em>Threat Intensity</em> being ‚ÄúVery High‚Äù as opposed to just ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù. This <a href="https://docs.tenable.com/tenablesc/director/5_18/Content/RiskMetrics.htm#Threat">intensity</a> is calculated based on the number and frequency of recently observed threat events (by Tenable themselves presumably).<p><a href="#question-33">Back to Question</a><h6 id="answer-34">Answer 3.4</h6><p>There are <a href="https://community.tenable.com/s/article/Useful-plugins-to-troubleshoot-credential-scans">quite a few different ways to troubleshoot/validate credentialed scans</a>. A few such options include the following plugins‚Ä¶<ul><li><a href="https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/19506">Plugin 19506</a> can be used by looking at the plugin output - specifically where it says ‚ÄúCredentialed checks : yes, as ‚Äòmsfadmin‚Äô via ssh‚Äù.<li>The presence of <a href="https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/117887">plugin 117887</a>, ‚ÄúLocal Checks Enabled‚Äù is a good sign that the scan was successful in logging in and performing <em>local</em> checks.<li><a href="https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/141118">Plugin 141118</a>, ‚ÄúTarget Credential Status by Authentication Protocol - Valid Credentials Provided‚Äù very explicitly claims that ‚Äúvalid credentials‚Äù have been provided.

In fact, <a href="https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/110385">plugin 110385</a>, ‚ÄúTarget Credential Issues by Authentication Protocol - Insufficient Privilege‚Äù tells us this exact thing.<p><a href="#question-35">Back to Question</a><h3 id="exercise-4-answers">Exercise 4 Answers</h3><h6 id="answer-41">Answer 4.1</h6><p>There is a toggle in the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù settings within the scan configuration wizard which can ‚Äú<a href="https://community.tenable.com/s/article/How-the-Stop-scanning-hosts-that-become-unresponsive-during-the-scan-setting-works">Stop scanning hosts that become unresponsive during scan</a>‚Äù.

You can find this by going to the scan configuraiton wizard settings, going to ‚ÄúAssessment ‚Äì&gt; Web Applications‚Äù, toggling ‚ÄúScan web applications‚Äù and then looking at the default value in the ‚ÄúUse a customer User-Agent‚Äù field.<p><a href="#question-42">Back to Question</a><h6 id="answer-43">Answer 4.3</h6><p><strong>SYN</strong>. You can find this by going to the scan configuration wizard settings, going to ‚ÄúDiscovery ‚Äì&gt; Port Scanning‚Äù, scrolling down to the ‚ÄúNetwork Port Scanners‚Äù section and then seeing that only the ‚ÄúSYN‚Äù check-box is checked (TCP and UDP are <em>not</em> checked by default).<p><a href="#question-43">Back to Question</a><h3 id="exercise-5-answers">Exercise 5 Answers</h3><h6 id="answer-51">Answer 5.1</h6><p>The <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/v2/guide">CVSS v2.0</a> Vector for the <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/48112">Shellshock</a> vulnerability is <strong>AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C</strong>. ‚ÄúAC:L‚Äù means that the ‚ÄúAccess Complexity‚Äù for successfully exploiting this vulnerability is <strong>Low</strong>.

This is not only <em>immediately exploitable</em> but also evidence of previous/current system compromise. In other words, an attacker is likely already on the system!

Though this may in fact reduce a lot of risk on the system, it still wouldn‚Äôt be the highest thing <em>I</em> would prioritize.

This section is the culmination of all the work you‚Äôve put in throughout this <a href="#bootcamp-intro">bootcamp</a>. Below is a progressive series of <em>six</em> exercises, each mapping to a different stage of the <a href="/symphonic-vulnerability-surface-mapping#a-primer-on-vulnerability-management">VM lifecycle</a>. They are designed to test your knowledge and evaluate your thought process as it relates to <em>real-world</em> VM scenarios. They are all open-ended such that there are no ‚Äúanswers‚Äù, rather they are more abstract thought exercises. I recommend you go through each, writing up a quick paragraph or two on how you would <em>solve</em> each of the prompts. <em>Optionally</em>, I invite you to <a href="/contact">contact me</a> (or start a discussion on the <a href="https://discord.gg/3rkHgtcYbb">Discord</a>) with your writeups and we can discuss your answers. At that time, I can give you my opinions and feedback on your answers. <em>Again</em>, there is not necessarily a single <strong>right</strong> answer to any of these prompts. You are also welcome to <a href="/contact">contact me</a> if there are any other questions about these scenarios. With all that said, let‚Äôs introduce the <strong>scenario-based exercises</strong>. <strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>These exercises require that you have completed all the exercises within the bootcamp</em>!<h6 id="scenario-1-identify">Scenario 1: <strong>IDENTIFY</strong></h6><p>An automated Nessus scan identified the <a href="https://www.chaitin.cn/en/ghostcat">Ghostcat</a> vulnerability (<a href="https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/134862">plugin 134862</a>) on a host. An automated report was sent to the system owner detailing the finding. The system owner has contacted the VM team (you) and is claiming the finding is a false-positive. How would you go about addressing this claim?<h6 id="scenario-2-classify">Scenario 2: <strong>CLASSIFY</strong></h6><p>The CISO has asked the VM team (you) to provide a list of the top 10 highest-risk vulnerabilities present within the organization‚Äôs environment. Assume Metasploitable is the <em>entirety</em> of the environment. What would be the top 10 vulnerabilities and how did you come to this determination?<h6 id="scenario-3-analyze">Scenario 3: <strong>ANALYZE</strong></h6><p>Upon receiving the scan report of the Metasploitable system, IT leadership has asked that the VM team (you) put together a risk assessment for the ‚Äú<em>NFS Exported Share Information Disclosure</em>‚Äù (<a href="https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/11356">plugin 11356</a>) finding. This finding has been identified on other systems within the network and leadership wants a more thorough understanding of the risk. Create this risk assessment, come up with a final risk determination and think of any additional questions you may need answered to accurately come up with this designation.<h6 id="scenario-4-prioritize">Scenario 4: <strong>PRIORITIZE</strong></h6><p>In <a href="#scenario-2-classify">Scenario 2</a>, we came up with a list of the top 10 highest risk vulnerabilities. We now need to <em>prioritize</em> the remediation of all findings within the Metasploitable scan report. How would you suggest prioritizing these fixes? Would you recommend fixing them in the order you specified earlier? If so or if not, explain why. I would recommend making some assumptions on a few things‚Ä¶<ul><li>What data is stored/processed by the Metasploitable system (in theory).<li>What resources are available for patching or implementing other defensive measures?<li>etc‚Ä¶</ul><h6 id="scenario-5-report">Scenario 5: <strong>REPORT</strong></h6><p><a href="https://www.tenable.com/blog/nessus-home-is-now-nessus-essentials">Nessus Essentials</a> has limited reporting options.

Below is a quick list of tips for hunting down applicable positions.<ul><li><em>Expand</em>. <em>Your</em>. <em>Search</em>. <strong>Look and apply everywhere</strong>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/">Linkedin</a>, <a href="https://www.monster.com">Monster</a>, <a href="https://www.simplyhired.com">SimplyHired</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://washingtondc.craigslist.org/d/jobs/search/nva/jjj">Craigslist</a>, <a href="https://www.dice.com">Dice</a>, <a href="https://www.indeed.com">Indeed</a>, Company career pages, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/member/home/index.htm">Glassdoor</a>, etc‚Ä¶ There may be a lot of overlap but widening the set of sources you use is a good start. I‚Äôll also add that <em>volume</em> of applications can be your friend. <em>Yes</em>, it is definitely work, and <em>yes</em>, it is frustrating to be turned down (again and again), but <strong>perseverance</strong> is key and applying to a lot of places will statistically up the probability you get an opportunity.<li><strong>Don‚Äôt be afraid to apply</strong>. What I mean is - yes, you want to avoid applying to places that you are completely unqualified for but don‚Äôt be too scared off by job reqs that ask for <em>N</em> years of experience. If it sounds like you can do what is being asked of you in the job req, or you at least have some or most of the qualifications, you need not worry that you don‚Äôt check every box.<li><strong>Don‚Äôt embellish or lie on your resume</strong>. You don‚Äôt need to. This is an entry-level job and they don‚Äôt expect you to know everything. If you‚Äôve never used a tool, don‚Äôt list it. If you‚Äôve used it once or twice though, put it on your resume! Everything on your resume is fair game and you should be ready to, at a minimum, explain what a tool is, what it does and in what capacity you have used it.<li><strong>‚ÄúVulnerability‚Äù is a good search term</strong>. A lot of VM jobs (<em>unsurprisingly</em> I guess) have titles which include ‚ÄúVulnerability‚Äù in it in some fashion (e.g. ‚Äú<em>Senior Engineer, Vulnerability Management</em>‚Äù, ‚Äú<em>Vulnerability Management Analyst</em>‚Äù, ‚Äú<em>Vulnerability Engineer</em>‚Äù, ‚Äú<em>Vulnerability Management Security Engineer - Security Operations</em>‚Äù, etc‚Ä¶) There is no standard title for VM, these are job titles I pulled off of a job board <em>today</em>! Play around with these search terms to cast the best possible net.<li>Not every company has positions that are <em>pure</em> VM. In many cases, VM responsibilities fall within the ‚ÄúSIOC‚Äù or engineering teams and as such, these jobs require experience or skills far beyond what is covered in this <a href="#bootcamp-intro">bootcamp</a>. I would recommend reading the job req and trying to determine what percentage of the daily responsibilities involve VM versus <em>other</em> engineering/SIOC-type-work. You may still be eligible for that position or the hiring manager may be willing to bring you in for your VM experience alone, as long as you are willing to learn the other facets of the role (and you <strong>should</strong> be eager to learn as much as possible!)</ul><p>I will add additional tips here as I think of them. <em>Now</em>, let‚Äôs talk about <a href="#vm-interview">the interview</a>‚Ä¶<hr /> <center><i class="ph ph-video-conference lg"></i></center><h1 id="vm-interview">VM Interview</h1><p>So you‚Äôve gone through the <a href="#bootcamp-intro">bootcamp</a>, <a href="#how-to-find-a-vm-job">applied to some VM positions</a> and now have an interview scheduled. <em>Well done</em>! It‚Äôs time to put it all together and <em>knock it outta the park</em>. Below, I have a <a href="#interview-tips">few quick tips</a> on your interview as well as a series of <a href="#interview-questions">common interview questions</a> (and some possible answers where appropriate).<h6 id="interview-tips"><strong>Interview Tips</strong></h6><ul><li><strong>Don‚Äôt be afraid to admit you don‚Äôt know something</strong>. If you‚Äôre asked a question you don‚Äôt know, state that you don‚Äôt know or are not sure, but <em>always</em> offer to explain your thought process for answering the question. Interviewers want to know how you think moreso than necessarily if you have the ‚Äúright‚Äù answer. In many cases there may be no right answer, so always offer up your thoughts. Try to keep them brief and to the point though - rambling on when you are very unsure can certainly be a turn-off for an interviewr.<li><strong>Be enthusiastic</strong>. This is true of any interview but particularly <em>potent</em> for entry-level / junior interviews. Those in charge of hiring understand that junior applicants may not have any real experience (<a href="#vm-bootcamp-lab">you do though!</a>), and it can be <em>really</em> hard to truly gauge someones technical acumen. What‚Äôs not hard however, is to see if someone is <em>truly</em> interested in the role and passionate about infosec.<li><strong>Have plenty of questions</strong>. Be ready to ask a lot of questions, this if nothing else will show interest in the role. Some example questions are‚Ä¶<ul><li>What tools does the team use?<li>What is the makeup of the team now?<li>What are the biggest challenges that the team currently faces?<li>Where would you like the program to be in 1 year? What about 2 years?<li>What does success look like to you for someone coming into this role?</ul><li>If you don‚Äôt know something or are otherwise stumped by a question, always return to being <em>very interested</em> and excited about learning more on that topic. Where it applies, you can even mention things you are learning currently that are related to that topic.<li>Be ready to explain the things you do at home / in-your-free-time to stay up-to-date on all things infosec. <a href="/getting-into-information-security#infosec-podcasts">Podcasts</a>, <a href="/an-ode-to-rss#title">RSS feeds</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/">Reddit</a>, Mastodon, <a href="/infosec-blogs#title">infosec blogs</a>, building a homelab, etc‚Ä¶<li><strong>Be yourself</strong> (<em>within reason</em>).</ul><h6 id="interview-questions"><strong>Interview Questions</strong></h6><ul><li><strong>Q</strong>: What port is <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/">HTTPS</a> typically on? ¬∑ <strong>A</strong>: <strong>443</strong> but it is also <a href="https://www.speedguide.net/port.php?port=8443">commonly found on port 8443</a>.<li><strong>Q</strong>: What are some vulnerabilities you are familiar with? ¬∑ <strong>A</strong>: Reference the <a href="#vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilties section</a> for some good ideas.<li><strong>Q</strong>: What is the difference between TCP and UDP? ¬∑ <strong>A</strong>: Reference the <a href="#networking">Networking section</a> for some good ideas.
